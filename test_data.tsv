93551	Aston Villa	Man Utd	2024-02-11	Villa Park, Birmingham		Robert Jones	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of today's Premier League clash between Burnley and Fulham at Turf Moor!
Seven points adrift of safety, Burnley were beaten by Manchester City in midweek and occupy 19th place in the Premier League table. On course for an instant return to the Championship, which they won in some style last season, the Clarets have accrued just four points from 33 available at home this term. Nonetheless, Vincent Kompany’s side will now aim to complete a top-flight double over today's opponents for the first time since 1966.
Fulham were forced to settle for a point in Tuesday's goalless draw at home to Everton, which at least ended their losing run in the league. However, the Cottagers have still lost five top-flight away games on the spin, as part of a ten-match winless run on the road. Not only have Fulham failed to score in five of their last six Premier League matches -  including a 2-0 defeat in December's reverse fixture - they haven’t won away to Burnley since 1951, with 28 winless visits since.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Lorenz Assignon, Hjalmar Ekdal, Dara O'Shea, Vitinho; Aaron Ramsey, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Wilson Odobert; Zeki Amdouni, Lyle Foster.
SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Ameen Al Dakhil, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Josh Cullen, David Datro Fofana, Mike Tresor, Han-Noah Massengo, Johann Gudmundsson, Maxime Esteve.
FULHAM (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Timothy Castagne, Tim Ream, Tosin Adarabioyo, Antonee Robinson; Joao Palhinha, Harrison Reed; Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Andreas Pereira, Willian; Rodrigo Muniz.
SUBS: Marek Rodak, Kenny Tete, Sasa Lukic, Fode Ballo-Toure, Armando Broja, Kristian Sekularac, Tom Cairney, Luc de Fougerolles, Joshua King.
In one of two changes to the Burnley team that started against Man City earlier this week, loan signing Assignon makes his Premier League debut, replacing Al Dakhil; Ramsey also comes in for Gudmundsson. Fofana - who set up a consolation goal on his debut - is again consigned to the bench, with Foster leading the line up front. Charlie Taylor, Jordan Beyer and Hannes Delcroix are all absent through injury.
Meanwhile, Marco Silva makes three changes to the Fulham XI that started against Everton in midweek: Ream replaces Diop in defence, Cairney makes way for Reed in midfield, with Rodrigo Muniz deputising for injured striker Raul Jimenez up front. Following a deadline-day arrival from Chelsea, Broja begins his Cottagers career on the bench, while Nigeria duo Alex Iwobi and Calvin Bassey are still away at the Africa Cup of Nations.
The players are all out on the pitch at Turf Moor, and kick-off in this Premier League contest is now just moments away!
The hosts kick off, and we are under way in Burnley!
An opening-week win over Everton remains the last time that Fulham won away from home in the Premier League, while Burnley hold the top flight's worst home record. That makes today's game particularly tough to predict.
Both sides are settling into the match, with no sustained period of possession for either, before Foster bursts down the right and chops inside, setting up a shot from Vitinho that is deflected well wide.
Fulham comfortably clear Burnley's corner, and the midfield contest resumes. These teams seem well-matched on the early evidence.
Though Rodrigo Muniz catches Berge with a high boot, only a free-kick is awarded by the referee, who could have chosen to show an early yellow card to the Fulham striker - he was quite careless there.
Back in the starting XI today, Ream saves his side with a crucial last-ditch interception, just as Odobert seems set to turn home Foster's low cross. That was a rapid attack by the hosts.
Berge covers across well to deny De Cordova-Reid a clear run through on goal, following an incisive low pass by Rodrigo Muniz. It's been a lively opening 10 minutes here, with both teams willing to fly forward on the counter.
Sending a drive skidding along the turf from 20 yards out, Berge only finds the gloves of Leno, who gathers the ball safely in the centre of his goal.
Some delightful wing play by Odobert sees him slip away from two men and then reach the left byline, but Casatagne intervenes and blocks his subsequent cross behind for a corner. It ultimately comes to nothing - still, Burnley are posing a real threat.
JUST WIDE! A teasing cross from the right picks out Castagne at the near post, but the full-back can only guide the ball past the right-hand post with an awkward attempted finish! Just off-target!
FULHAM GO IN FRONT! The Cottagers are 1-0 up at Turf Moor! Joao Palhinha steals in to meet Andreas Pereira's inswinging corner, beating several Burnley defenders to the ball and steering his header into the back of the net! Trafford had no chance: Burnley's home woes continue!
Set-piece specialist Andreas Pereira delivers an inviting corner-kick for Joao Palhinha to turn in at the near post.
Burnley have now conceded 22 first-half goals in 23 Premier League matches - more than any other team in the English top flight this season. How will they respond?
FULHAM STRIKE AGAIN! Rodrigo Muniz pounces this time, putting the visitors 2-0 up! Trafford is stranded, having edged forward off his line, and the Brazilian striker receives Robinson's pass before coolly lofting the ball over Burnley's goalkeeper and into the net! What a start from the Cottagers, who are on course for a first win at Turf Moor for more than 70 years!
Robinson sends Rodrigo Muniz through on goal, recording his fourth assist in the Premier League this season.
Foster brings down Joao Palhinha in midfield, and the home fans' frustrations grow. It's been a horror start to this game for Burnley, who are in desperate need of points.
With a healthy lead in hand, Fulham are focusing on keeping possession now: the away side have had 67 per cent of the ball so far. Burnley don't really seem to have an answer to them at the moment.
Burnley are still being pinned back, with Foster regularly engaged in helping out his defence. Marco Silva must be delighted with Fulham's intensity and movement so far - they've become the dominant force in this game.
After receiving the ball from Rodrigo Muniz - who notched his first Premier League goal of the season earlier in the game - Willian strikes at goal from the edge of the area, but his effort is blocked by a Burnley defender.
Fulham's six January fixtures across the Premier League, FA Cup and EFL Cup saw Marco Silva's men only manage to find the net on three occasions - today, they've already scored two and look likely to add more.
SHARP STOP! After Andreas Pereira is sent clear, with Burnley's bedraggled defence left wide open, he cuts in from the left and drills a shot towards the top-left corner. Trafford is equal to it, though, and palms the ball over his crossbar!
Willian is penalised for a shove on Assignon, so Burnley have a welcome set-piece opportunity out on the right flank. However, after an outswinging cross causes a moment of minor panic in the Fulham area, the visitors manage to clear their lines.
Shortly after Odobert fires a shot high over the crossbar, he wins a free-kick from De Cordova-Reid on the left wing. It comes to nothing, but he's offered a rare ray of light for Burnley today.
CLOSE! Burnley are growing in confidence now! At the end of a long passing sequence inside Fulham's half, Odobert bundles his way through two challenges and fires wide from just inside the box! It zipped only inches past the right-hand post!
Fulham appear to have run out of steam, with Burnley coming back into this encounter as half-time approaches. Can the Clarets reduce their deficit before the break?
A reckless lunge to meet a dropping ball sees Reed catch Odobert with his studs. The referee doesn't hesitate to flash his yellow card for the first time today.
Odobert has remained on the turf after Reed's ugly challenge, with the medics checking him over. The action is paused as a result, so both teams take on drinks and tactical instructions during the break in play.
Apparently fully recovered, Odobert now returns from the touchline, in the first of at least three minutes of first-half stoppage time.
For a clear show of dissent towards the referee, Andreas Pereira is needlessly booked on the brink of half-time.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 0-2 FULHAM
Rewarded for a greater share of possession and clinical finishing when their chances arose, Fulham shook off their final-third slumbers to score twice during a first half that Burnley lost control of after a relatively bright start. First, Joao Palhinha flicked in a header from close range, before Rodrigo Muniz lobbed the Cottagers further in front shortly after, as Turf Moor was left in stunned silence. The visitors are therefore on course for their first success at this ground since 1951, while their hosts have it all to do after the interval: on this evidence, the Clarets could be heading back to the Championship a few months from now.
Since April 2023, Fulham are unbeaten in four league matches when leading at half-time, winning on three occasions; meanwhile, Burnley have a record of 13 straight losses when trailing at the break this season. The outcome of today's game seems set in stone, then - but stranger things have happened in the Premier League.
Kompany has reacted to Burnley's first-half showing with a change during the break: new signing Esteve replaces Ekdal.
Fulham kick off, and we are back under way at Turf Moor!
Vitinho's cross from the left byline is only partly cleared away by Robinson, but Ramsey's strike at goal on the follow-up is mishit straight towards Leno, who makes a routine save.
Vitinho fells De Cordova-Reid with a clumsy challenge, gifting Fulham a free-kick. However, Andreas Pereira's clipped delivery is uncharacteristcally wayward, allowing Trafford to comfortably claim the ball by the penalty spot.
Fulham have picked up the pace early in this second half, as they aim to put the game to bed. Burnley are yet to show any signs of staging a comeback.
After a loose ball by Brownhill opens the door for Fulham, Berge hurriedly tracks back to block a Rodrigo Muniz shot from just inside the box. The home side are certainly not helping themselves in this error-strewn display.
Ream guides the ball behind for a Fulham goal-kick, after Amdouni fails to steal the ball high up on the right flank. The latter has had precious little opportunity to make an impact on today's game.
SAVE! Following a short-corner routine, Burnley are again left flat-footed. Willian makes the most of some time and space on the left, drilling a powerful low shot towards the bottom corner - Trafford dives down to tip the ball away!
SUPER STOP! Trafford to the rescue again! This time, the Burnley goalkeeper reaches up to push a thumping header by Tosin towards the top of his goal! The Fulham defender rose highest and met Andreas Pereira's corner, but couldn't quite find the net!
TRAFFORD KEEPS THE SCORE DOWN AGAIN! Rodrigo Muniz angles a low shot towards the bottom corner from just inside the area, and Burnley's busy goalkeeper makes another important save! He dives left to palm the ball away to safety - will Fulham rue spurning these chances?
If anything, Burnley have worsened since the half-time break, and Fulham are full of confidence now. It's as if January never happened for the Cottagers.
Esteve dives in to make a crucial sliding block on Andreas Pereira's low cross, conceding a corner-kick in the process. Without the substitute's intervention, surely Fulham would have extended their two-goal advantage.
Kompany has seen enough and decides to make two further changes: first, Amdouni is replaced by Fofana up front.
Gudmunds­son is also introduced, as Ramsey traipses off the pitch.
After pouncing on a pass near the edge of Fulham's area, Brownhill then slashes his shot at goal high over Leno's crossbar - that lacked a little composure.
Willian's influence is growing, as the Brazilian winger picks out Castagne's run towards the back post with a perfectly judged crossfield pass - the Fulham full-back can only turn it well wide, though.
SAVE! Trafford is keeping Fulham at bay single-handedly! This time, Willian picks up the ball on the left side of the box following a corner, then fires in a shot that the Burnley stopper turns away with a smart save!
BURNLEY ARE BACK IN IT! Out of nowhere, Fofana finds a goal to reduce the Clarets' arrears: it's just 2-1 to Fulham! On the break, Assignon picks out his fellow new boy in the box with a lofted pass, and as Leno is left stranded, the Chelsea loanee calmly guides home a header!
Crossing from the left, Assignon finds Fofana in the box to set up Burnley's first goal of the game.
Marco Silva now responds to his team's slip-up by sending on some fresh legs up front: Rodrigo Muniz makes way for Fulham debutant Broja.
Captain Cairney is also introduced to steady the ship, with De Cordova-Reid the man being replaced.
Ream is left down on the turf after Foster nudges the American defender over in an aerial challenge. After a brief pause, though, the game can resume. Having been in total control and then missed several good chances, Fulham are now keen to run down the clock.
Assignon asserts himself well to edge Willian out of play on the byline, just as the Fulham winger threatens to produce another opportunity for his team.
The latest Andreas Pereira cross almost finds Broja in the box, but Castagne instead meets it first and glances his header well wide of the target. Burnley breathe again - can they now find a late equaliser?
The home side are replicating the pattern of their first half performance, as they grow stronger as the final whistle approaches. Fulham are being forced back now.
Berge is booked for catching Joao Palhinha just outside Fulham's area, with a tackle that is more tired than aggressive.
Fulham opt for a conservative substitution, as they try to hang on to all three points: chief creator Andreas Pereira departs, with Tete sent on to help out the visitors' defence.
Unable to reach a hanging free-kick from the right by Willian, Broja can only watch the ball drift wide for a Burnley free-kick. It was a rare mishit from the winger's set-piece delivery.
Bruun Larsen is now sent on to bolster Burnley's attack, with Vitinho making way.
Odobert shimmies inside from the left flank and beats Tete, but Fofana fails to control his ball into the box. Then, O'Shea overhits a pass, as Burnley's latest attempt to find a leveller comes to nothing.
Burnley's final roll of the dice: debutant Assignon is withdrawn; Massengo comes on for the closing stages.
FOFANA SAVES THE DAY! Burnley draw level at the death! In the first of five added minutes for stoppages, Fofana slides home a low Odobert cross from the left! The substitute beats Ream to the ball and bundles it into the net from close range - what an impact by the Chelsea loanee! He makes it 2-2 at Turf Moor, where Fulham's long wait for a win will surely go on!
Due to excessively celebrating his second goal - Burnley's equaliser - Fofana is shown a yellow card. He won't care!
Burnley survive a Willian corner, and belief grows that they can snatch an improbable point from a game they've been second-best in. There are only seconds remaining now.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 2-2 FULHAM
Turning the game on its head, Burnley mount a brave fightback late in the second half and hold Fulham to a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor. The Clarets had been insipid for most of the match, as their visitors dominated both possession and the shot count, but Fulham's failure to finish off several chances came back to bite them in the end. After establishing a deserved two-goal lead at the interval, Trafford kept the Cottagers at bay with several fine saves before Fofana struck twice on the break. Fulham's 72-year wait for a win in Burnley goes on, as the home side rescue a precious point against all the odds. They visit Premier League leaders Liverpool next week, while Marco Silva's men must try to bounce back at home to Bournemouth. That's all from today's live coverage, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	"Scott McTominay was the hero once again for Manchester United as his late header earned a 2-1 win at Aston Villa, boosting the Red Devils' hopes of securing UEFA Champions League football next season.
Rasmus Hojlund opened the scoring on 17 minutes in a breathless encounter at Villa Park, but Douglas Luiz levelled for the home side midway through the second half.
It was McTominay who provided the decisive moment on 86 minutes, heading in from Diogo Dalot's superb cross to secure a crucial three points and United's third straight league victory. His seven league goals this season have won United 12 points this season, more than any other player in the competition.
Goalkeeper Andre Onana was also in inspired form, making eight saves, his joint-most in a match since joining Man Utd, as Villa suffered back-to-back home defeats following a 17-match unbeaten run at Villa Park.
How the match unfolded
Viila made two changes from the team that won 5-0 at Sheffield United last weekend, with Matty Cash and Jacob Ramsey coming in for Ezri Konsa and Youri Tielemans.
As for Man Utd, Raphael Varane replaced the injured Lisandro Martinez.
In an open start to the match, Villa dominated possession, but Man Utd carried the greater goal threat, with most of their opportunities coming from set-pieces.
Harry Maguire headed over the bar from a corner before playing a direct role in the opening goal.
The centre-back rose highest to direct Bruno Fernandes' corner towards Hojlund, who beat the offside trap and finished from close range.
Aged 21 years and seven days old, Hojlund is the second-youngest player to score in five successive Premier League appearances, only behind Nicolas Anelka, who did so for Arsenal in November 1998, aged 19 years and 239 days.
Villa reacted well and had a series of shots as Leon Bailey curled an effort wide and John McGinn stung the palms of Onana with a long-range strike, before Ollie Watkins was thwarted by the Cameroon goalkeeper.
United were forced into making a change at half-time, with Luke Shaw making way for Victor Lindelof. Erik ten Hag revealed after the match that the left-back with withdrawn as a precaution. 
Both sides had chances early in the second half, with Marcus Rashford's driving run resulting in a tame effort that was saved by Emiliano Martinez before Watkins missed a great opportunity to level, shooting straight at Onana from point-blank range.
The home side continued to press for an equaliser, with Ramsey's weak shot cleared by Dalot, but Villa's persistence paid off as they made it 1-1 through Douglas Luiz.
United were unable to clear Bailey's corner, and when the ball came back to the winger, his low cross was turned into the roof of the net by the Brazilian for his seventh goal of the season.
The lively Alejandro Garnacho nearly put United back in front immediately, but his low shot went agonisingly wide of a post.
Douglas Luiz then missed a great chance to give Villa the lead, failing to get enough on a left-footed effort that was easily dealt with by Onana."	Team_2		"Hello and welcome to live coverage of today's Premier League clash between Team_6 and Team_10 at Turf Moor!

Unable to reach a hanging free-kick from the right by Willian, Broja can only watch the ball drift wide for a Team_6 free-kick. It was a rare mishit from the winger's set-piece delivery.
Bruun Larsen is now sent on to bolster Team_6 attack, with Vitinho making way.
Odobert shimmies inside from the left flank and beats Tete, but Fofana fails to control his ball into the box. Then, O'Shea overhits a pass, as Team_6 latest attempt to find a leveller comes to nothing.
Team_6 final roll of the dice: debutant Assignon is withdrawn; Massengo comes on for the closing stages.
FOFANA SAVES THE DAY! Team_6 draw level at the death! In the first of five added minutes for stoppages, Fofana slides home a low Odobert cross from the left! The substitute beats Ream to the ball and bundles it into the net from close range - what an impact by the Team_7 loanee! He makes it 2-2 at Turf Moor, where Team_10 long wait for a win will surely go on!
Due to excessively celebrating his second goal - Team_6 equaliser - Fofana is shown a yellow card. He won't care!
Team_6 survive a Willian corner, and belief grows that they can snatch an improbable point from a game they've been second-best in. There are only seconds remaining now.
FULL-TIME: Team_6 2-2 Team_10
Turning the game on its head, Team_6 mount a brave fightback late in the second half and hold Team_10 to a 2-2 draw at Turf Moor. The Clarets had been insipid for most of the match, as their visitors dominated both possession and the shot count, but Team_10 failure to finish off several chances came back to bite them in the end. After establishing a deserved two-goal lead at the interval, Trafford kept the Cottagers at bay with several fine saves before Fofana struck twice on the break. Team_10 72-year wait for a win in Team_6 goes on, as the home side rescue a precious point against all the odds. They visit Premier League leaders Team_11 next week, while Marco Silva's men must try to bounce back at home to Team_3. That's all from today's live coverage, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93341	Arsenal	Fulham	2023-08-26	Emirates Stadium, London	59961.0	Paul Tierney	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this fixture on the opening matchday of the 2023-24 Premier League season. Newly promoted Sheffield United are back in the top-flight after two years away, and kick their campaign off against Crystal Palace at Bramall Lane.
Finishing second to champions Burnley in last season’s promotion race, Paul Heckingbottom’s Blades have not had the smoothest preparations ahead of their Premier League return, losing key men Iliman Ndiaye and Sander Berge to fund the addition of five new signings.
A middling 2022-23 season at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles fly a bit too close to the trapdoor, prior to Roy Hodgson’s arrival in late March. The veteran manager returned to the club to replace Patrick Vieira, and oversaw five victories in 10 as Palace pulled well clear of the bottom three to establish some real momentum coming into the new season.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (3-5-2): Wes Foderingham; Anel Ahmedhodzic, John Egan, Jack Robinson; George Baldock, Chris Basham, Oliver Norwood, Ben Osborn, Max Lowe; Benie Traore, William Osula.
SHEFFIELD UNITED SUBS: Adam Davies, Auston Trusty, Vinicius Souza, Anis Ben Slimane, Yasser Larouci, Louie Marsh, Andre Brooks, Femi Seriki, Antwoine Hackford.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Marc Guehi, Joachim Andersen, Tyrick Mitchell; Jefferson Lerma, Cheick Doucoure; Jordan Ayew, Eberechi Eze, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Remi Matthews, James Tomkins, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Nathaniel Clyne, Chris Richards, Naouirou Ahamada, John-Kymani Gordon, Jairo Riedewald, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi.
United’s first XI on their top-flight return features eight players from the 2020-21 campaign which saw the Blades relegated to the Championship. Only one completely new face makes his debut, with Traore partnering academy product Osula up front following his signing from Swedish champions Hacken. Fellow arrivals Trusty, Vinicius and Slimane are on the bench for Heckingbottom's side.
It’s a Palace side missing Wilfried Zaha for the first time in a long time, after the Eagles talisman moved on a free transfer to Galatasaray in Turkey. New singing Lerma does make his debut in the heart of midfield, while Johnstone steps in for the wantaway Guaita between the sticks.
The teams walk out onto the pitch at the famous old Bramall Lane stadium in Sheffield, with players, coaches and fans ready for a brand-new season!
Norwood kicks off for Sheffield United, and Premier League football is underway at Bramall Lane!
The Blades have lost just one of their last five home league games against Palace, though that loss came in their last such meeting in May 2021.
Osborn manages to turn his way out of a challenge before playing a one-two with Norwood down the left. He crosses the return ball into the box, but Andersen nods it clear with a strong defensive header.
Between December 2006 and July 2020, the Blades won 10 consecutive Premier League home games against London sides. However, they failed to win any of their six such games in their last top-flight campaign of 2020-21, losing the last five in a row.
Baldock and Lerma tussle in the far corner, and the Colombian's block on the wing-back's cross sends the ball behind for the first corner of the game.
Ayew skips down the right and looks to find Edouard on the edge of the box, but a series of deflections sends the loose ball back and into the gloves of Foderingham.
WIDE!!! Osula flicks a long ball on and gets it back from Traore. He picks his spot from the edge of the box and shoots, curling a low effort that rolls just around the wrong side of the far post!
All six Premier League meetings between United and Palace have seen the winning team keep a clean sheet – the Eagles won both meetings in both 1992-93 and 2020-21, while the Blades won both in 2019-20.
Eze pops up in the box and twists away from Norwood. He then goes down under pressure from Baldock but the referee isn't convinced and waves away his penalty claims.
The Blades won their opening match in each of their first two Premier League campaigns, but have failed to do so in any of their subsequent three in 2006-07, 2019-20 and 2020-21.
BLOCKED!!! Eze and Edouard combine on the break for Palace, with the latter bypassing several defenders as he races into the box. He's forced wide and shoots from the left side of the box, but Ahmedhodzic gets back to block his effort away!
Doucoure latches onto a lofted pass and looks to bring the ball down on the edge of the box, but United's packed defence is able to intervene and clear.
Osula is flagged for offside and boots the ball away, being met with a yellow card for dissent by the referee, the first of this game.
BLOCKED!!! Eze finds space to shoot on the edge of the box and does so, but his effort is blocked. The ball ricochets back into his path and he again looks to pick his spot, but in steps Egan to block a second attempt!
Palace recycle possession well following that Eze chance and Ayew races in behind, but his cross from the byline is a good height for Foderingham and the Blades goalkeeper collects.
Palace finished the 2022-23 season with a game against each of the three promoted sides (Bournemouth, Fulham and Nottingham Forest). By facing Sheffield United in this game, the Eagles are the first side to have four consecutive top-flight games against promoted sides since Arsenal in November 1991.
Edouard latches onto Ward's throughball in behind the hosts' defence, but his low shot from the right-hand side is an easy one for Foderingham to save and hold.
BALL IN THE NET!!! Palace are denied an opener by the linesman's flag! A thumping 35-yard effort from Andersen is parried by Foderingham at full stretch, but Ayew is on hand to nod the loose ball into the far corner! He wheels away to celebrate, but the flag is correctly raised and the goal will not count!
Palace break down the right and Ayew looks for the underlapping run of Eze into the box, but his cross is deflected and goes behind for a corner.
Sheffield United have won their opening league game in just one of the last nine seasons, beating Brentford 1-0 in 2017-18. They've lost seven of those, including their last three in a row, only once having a longer such run (four straight between 1928-29 and 1931-32).
Ahmedhodzic picks out Osborn with a long, diagonal pass down the right, but Andersen steps across to nod the bouncing ball behind for a Sheffield United corner.
Egan escapes his marker easily to connect with a free header at the front post, but the Blades captain can't direct his effort on target as it sails over the bar.
SAVED!!! A half-clearance comes out to Doucoure, whose low drive on the half-volley is saved and held by Foderingham, who had to race across his line to get there!
BLOCKED!!! A deflected Eze shot comes out to Ayew on the right, who has a go himself and sees his near-post effort blocked into the side netting by Lowe!
OVER!!! From the corner, Guehi flicks Eze's delivery on towards Edouard, who can't keep his header down at the back post and sends it over the bar!
Osborn stands up his marker before connecting with Baldock on the overlap. He charges into the area and cuts the ball back from the byline, but it's put behind for a corner by a sliding Lerma!
Norwood's delivery is met by Ahmedhodzic at the far post, but his headed effort is poor, traveling high and wide of the target as the Blades waste another set-piece opportunity!
Ward advances up the right and tries to hook a cross towards the box, but Osborn is there and the ball is blocked behind for another Palace corner.
Eze looks to play a one-two and shoot from a Palace free-kick, but his planned set-piece is read by the hosts and Osula steps in to make the block.
Traore looks to profit from a loose ball and run through the lines, but he's quickly dispossessed by Guehi for Palace. He's not been able to make much of an impression on his Premier League debut so far.
None of the Blades' last 24 games in the Premier League have ended level, the longest current ongoing run without a draw in the competition.
SAVED!!! Baldock's teasing cross into the box is flicked away by Andersen, but Sheffield United keep possession as Lowe tees up Norwood. He's in space to shoot and lets fly from 25 yards, but the low drive is an easy one for Johnstone to save and hold!
We'll play just the one additional minute to close out a closely-fought first half at Bramall Lane.
Lerma slides in wildly to clip Traore from behind, giving Sheffield United a late free-kick chance on the stroke of half-time.
Osborne's delivery sails into the box but is well claimed by Johnstone at his far post, and that should just about be that for the first half.
HALF-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 0-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.
An end-to-end first half ends goalless, with both sides having plenty of opportunities but being let down by a lack of quality in the final third. Palace did have the ball in the net, but Ayew's header was rightly chalked off for offside, and while Osula curled an early effort just wide for the Blades, it's Palace who have had the majority of chances. Andersen and Doucoure have both forced Foderingham into saves, but the goalkeeper has otherwise been well protected by an organised defence who have blocked and cleared everything Palace have thrown at them.
Eze has pulled the strings with aplomb so far for Palace, continuing the strong form he showed to earn an England call-up last season. In the first 45 minutes of the new campaign, the Eagles' number 10 has fired off five shots, with four being blocked, as well as creating three chances from 10 passes in the final third. He's also attempted five crosses, and won a free-kick as he looks to drive Palace forward with every opportunity he gets on the ball.
The teams are back and ready for the second half, and given how tight it's been so far, you get the sense that the opening goal could be crucial!
Edouard gets the second half underway, and we're back up and running at Bramall Lane!
Traore profits on a slip from Guehi and spreads the ball wide to Baldock. He tees up Norwood to cross into the area, but the midfielder's attempt is overhit and sails straight into Johnstone's gloves.
GOOOOOAAALLLL!!!! The Eagles soar into an early second half lead! Lerma drives forward and finds Ayew in space to his right. He bursts past Osborn before whipping a brilliant ball into the centre of the box, and Edouard pops up to tap in the opening goal! A clinical finish from the Palace striker, and it puts his side 1-0 up at Bramall Lane!
A poacher's finish from Edouard, but that was a goal made by Ayew's cross. A superb ball into the middle, that came from a darting run across Osborn on the byline.
Palace have avoided defeat in their last six Premier League matches after scoring the opening goal, dating back to a 2-1 loss to Chelsea in October 2022.
Egan is caught out facing his own goal by Edouard, but Robinson drops back in support and is able to step in, with his clearance deflecting behind off the goalscorer for a goal kick.
Palace win a free-kick 25 yards from goal, but Eze's attempted shot strikes the hosts' wall and Ward can't make anything of the rebound.
Eze dances through several challenges as he enters the left side of the box, before pulling the ball back to Doucoure. However, a heavy first touch from the midfielder sees him closed down quickly and Egan thumps the ball clear.
A smart touch forward by Doucoure gives Schlupp the chance to run into open space, but he's caught very late by a sliding Ahmedhodzic, with the Blades defender going straight into the book for that challenge.
Andersen moves up the right edge with the ball for Palace, but he's tracked all the way and taken down by Traore, giving the visitors a free-kick from a good crossing position.
Edouard is first onto Eze's cross from the set-piece, but his cushioned header back across the face is nodded behind by Lowe for a corner.
SAVED!!! Another Palace free-kick, this time from the left, is swung in by Eze, and Edouard is the target once again. The goalscorer has a free header at the far post, but can't generate anywhere near enough power on it as Foderingham makes an easy save!
BLOCKED!!! Forward come the Blades as Traore slips Osborn in behind the defence, but Andersen slides across at full tilt to block the midfielder's first-time shot!
Palace have lost their opening league game in each of the last two seasons (0-3 v Chelsea, 0-2 v Arsenal). They've never done so in three consecutive top-flight campaigns before.
The atmosphere is rising louder and louder as challenges fly in from all angles. Blades forward Traore has committed five fouls himself, but a late tackle from Andersen on the Ivorian brings the loudest cheer we've heard so far as the referee gives the free-kick.
Edouard's 50th minute opener was his fifth effort on goal in the game, the first time he has attempted at least five shots in a match in the Premier League since January 2022 against West Ham.
A long goal kick from Johnstone bounces all the way through to Edouard in the box, but neither he nor Ayew can get past Robinson and Osborn clears for the home side.
BALL IN THE NET!!! Palace are denied again! A sumptuous passing move culminates in Mitchell drilling a low cross towards the far post. Egan lunges and misses the ball, which rolls through for Edouard to tap home, but he did so from an offside position and so the goal will not count!
SAVED!!! Schlupp and Eze combine down the left, with Schlupp continuing his run into the box. He receives the return ball and shoots low, but Foderingham is equal to the effort and parries it away!
A cross-field ball drops kindly for Ahmedhodzic, who fires a volley from the edge of the box which takes a deflection off Guehi as it flies over the top!
CHANCE!!! A deft headed touch from Lerma allows him to run in behind the Blades' defence, but his final ball across to Eze is deflected and drops instead for Edouard. He tees up Eze to his left, but the eventual shot from the Palace playmaker is blocked and Foderingham collects!
WIDE!!! And Sheffield United go even closer at the other end! Foderingham's long clearance is brought down by Traore, who squares for Osula in the box. His first-time finish has plenty of power behind it, but not quite the direction as it smashes into the side netting!
SAVED!!! Ayew takes on Robinson as he dribbles into the box, before stepping right and letting fly from a tight angle which draws a strong save from Foderingham at his near post!
An injury to Lowe halts the game as the left-wing-back receives treatment, and both sides use the opportunity to take a well-earned break and some fluids on the sideline.
Space opens up for Lerma to shoot from 25 yards, and the Colombian obliges with a low shot that flies just wide of the near post!
A triple change is made by Heckingbottom, with Robinson the first player off and debutant Slimane taking his place for the Blades.
Basham also comes off, and is replaced in central midfield by another new signing, Vinicius.
Larouci completes a hat-trick of Sheffield United debuts from the bench, as he replaces the injured Lowe out wide for the last 10 minutes.
Ayew looks to exploit Larouci's freshness as the pair do battle down the right, but the Palace forward's cross into the centre is hoofed clear by Egan.
WIDE!!! A cross-field pass from Mitchell is over the head of Larouci as Ayew collects the ball. He squares for the arriving Eze on the penalty spot, but the England international's early shot is dragged wide of the target!
Eze cuts inside Slimane looking to spark another Palace attack, but the Tunisian barges him over from behind and is booked just minutes into his Blades debut.
SAVED!!! What a stop that is from Foderingham! Eze's delivery is met by Andersen in the six-yard box, whose downward header from close range looks certain to find the back of the net, but the goalkeeper somehow gets down to push the ball off the line and away!
Heckingbottom makes two more changes as we enter the final throws of this game, with Sheffield-born youngster Brooks replacing Osborn in midfield.
Traore has put himself about despite limited service on his Blades debut, as he comes off late for Hackford.
A cross is headed out to Norwood on the edge of the box, but his ambitious half-volley almost clears the stadium roof as it sails well over the top.
The Palace box is packed with red and white shirts as Baldock fires in a cross, but Andersen rises to nod the ball away and it's cleared further by Lerma as the visitors hold on.
We're into five added minutes in the Steel City, and it's now or never if the Blades want to secure at least one point on their return to the top flight.
Guehi is moving gingerly after awkwardly rising and landing to connect with an aerial ball, with the Palace captain replaced at centre-back by Tomkins in a precautionary late change.
A long throw is launched into the box with Egan the target, but Johnstone climbs to get to the ball ahead of the Blades captain, and he'll be in no hurry at all to get rid of it from here.
FULL-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 0-1 CRYSTAL PALACE.
All over at Bramall Lane, and that close-range strike from Edouard early in the second period is enough to grant Palace all three points and condemn the hosts to a defeat on their Premier League return! A bright start to the second half saw the Eagles pounce inside five minutes as Ayew's fantastic cross was turned goalwards by Edouard, and the Frenchman had another chalked off from an offside position as Palace peppered Foderingham's goal with chances for Schlupp, Ayew and Andersen. The Blades hardly tested Johnstone at the other end, going closest through Osula's shot wide, as Palace held on to secure the victory and an ideal start to their 2023-24 campaign.
Leading the line for this exciting Palace XI, Edouard was superb up front for the entire match, scoring the only goal of the game and registering 1.12 xG (expected goals) from his seven total shots, three of which were on target. The Frenchman also managed 10 touches in the Blades' box, completed all eight of his final-third passes, and won 10 of his 17 duels, including two of three dribbles as he provided a constant outlet for Palace to springboard their attacks.
Their first campaign back in the top flight begins with defeat for Sheffield United, who will certainly need to show more in the final third if they're to respond with victory against Nottingham Forest in their next game. Palace though, start as they mean to go on with three valuable points on the board already, ahead of a clash with London rivals Arsenal in their first home game of the season.
That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game! We'll see you soon for the next one, which won't be far away whatsoever - football is back!"

Andersen moves up the right edge with the ball for Palace, but he's tracked all the way and taken down by Traore, giving the visitors a free-kick from a good crossing position.
Edouard is first onto Eze's cross from the set-piece, but his cushioned header back across the face is nodded behind by Lowe for a corner.
SAVED!!! Another Palace free-kick, this time from the left, is swung in by Eze, and Edouard is the target once again. The goalscorer has a free header at the far post, but can't generate anywhere near enough power on it as Foderingham makes an easy save!
BLOCKED!!! Forward come the Blades as Traore slips Osborn in behind the defence, but Andersen slides across at full tilt to block the midfielder's first-time shot!
Palace have lost their opening league game in each of the last two seasons (0-3 v Team_7, 0-2 v Team_1). They've never done so in three consecutive top-flight campaigns before.
The atmosphere is rising louder and louder as challenges fly in from all angles. Blades forward Traore has committed five fouls himself, but a late tackle from Andersen on the Ivorian brings the loudest cheer we've heard so far as the referee gives the free-kick.
Edouard's 50th minute opener was his fifth effort on goal in the game, the first time he has attempted at least five shots in a match in the Premier League since January 2022 against Team_19.
A long goal kick from Johnstone bounces all the way through to Edouard in the box, but neither he nor Ayew can get past Robinson and Osborn clears for the home side.
BALL IN THE NET!!! Palace are denied again! A sumptuous passing move culminates in Mitchell drilling a low cross towards the far post. Egan lunges and misses the ball, which rolls through for Edouard to tap home, but he did so from an offside position and so the goal will not count!
SAVED!!! Schlupp and Eze combine down the left, with Schlupp continuing his run into the box. He receives the return ball and shoots low, but Foderingham is equal to the effort and parries it away!
A cross-field ball drops kindly for Ahmedhodzic, who fires a volley from the edge of the box which takes a deflection off Guehi as it flies over the top!
CHANCE!!! A deft headed touch from Lerma allows him to run in behind the Blades' defence, but his final ball across to Eze is deflected and drops instead for Edouard. He tees up Eze to his left, but the eventual shot from the Palace playmaker is blocked and Foderingham collects!
WIDE!!! And Team_17 go even closer at the other end! Foderingham's long clearance is brought down by Traore, who squares for Osula in the box. His first-time finish has plenty of power behind it, but not quite the direction as it smashes into the side netting!
SAVED!!! Ayew takes on Robinson as he dribbles into the box, before stepping right and letting fly from a tight angle which draws a strong save from Foderingham at his near post!
An injury to Lowe halts the game as the left-wing-back receives treatment, and both sides use the opportunity to take a well-earned break and some fluids on the sideline.
Space opens up for Lerma to shoot from 25 yards, and the Colombian obliges with a low shot that flies just wide of the near post!
A triple change is made by Heckingbottom, with Robinson the first player off and debutant Slimane taking his place for the Blades.
Basham also comes off, and is replaced in central midfield by another new signing, Vinicius.
Larouci completes a hat-trick of Team_17 debuts from the bench, as he replaces the injured Lowe out wide for the last 10 minutes.
Ayew looks to exploit Larouci's freshness as the pair do battle down the right, but the Palace forward's cross into the centre is hoofed clear by Egan.
WIDE!!! A cross-field pass from Mitchell is over the head of Larouci as Ayew collects the ball. He squares for the arriving Eze on the penalty spot, but the England international's early shot is dragged wide of the target!
Eze cuts inside Slimane looking to spark another Palace attack, but the Tunisian barges him over from behind and is booked just minutes into his Blades debut.
SAVED!!! What a stop that is from Foderingham! Eze's delivery is met by Andersen in the six-yard box, whose downward header from close range looks certain to find the back of the net, but the goalkeeper somehow gets down to push the ball off the line and away!
Heckingbottom makes two more changes as we enter the final throws of this game, with Sheffield-born youngster Brooks replacing Osborn in midfield.
Traore has put himself about despite limited service on his Blades debut, as he comes off late for Hackford.
A cross is headed out to Norwood on the edge of the box, but his ambitious half-volley almost clears the stadium roof as it sails well over the top.
The Palace box is packed with red and white shirts as Baldock fires in a cross, but Andersen rises to nod the ball away and it's cleared further by Lerma as the visitors hold on.
We're into five added minutes in the Steel City, and it's now or never if the Blades want to secure at least one point on their return to the top flight.
Guehi is moving gingerly after awkwardly rising and landing to connect with an aerial ball, with the Palace captain replaced at centre-back by Tomkins in a precautionary late change.
A long throw is launched into the box with Egan the target, but Johnstone climbs to get to the ball ahead of the Blades captain, and he'll be in no hurry at all to get rid of it from here.
FULL-TIME: Team_17 0-1 Team_8.
All over at Bramall Lane, and that close-range strike from Edouard early in the second period is enough to grant Palace all three points and condemn the hosts to a defeat on their Premier League return! A bright start to the second half saw the Eagles pounce inside five minutes as Ayew's fantastic cross was turned goalwards by Edouard, and the Frenchman had another chalked off from an offside position as Palace peppered Foderingham's goal with chances for Schlupp, Ayew and Andersen. The Blades hardly tested Johnstone at the other end, going closest through Osula's shot wide, as Palace held on to secure the victory and an ideal start to their 2023-24 campaign.
Leading the line for this exciting Palace XI, Edouard was superb up front for the entire match, scoring the only goal of the game and registering 1.12 xG (expected goals) from his seven total shots, three of which were on target. The Frenchman also managed 10 touches in the Blades' box, completed all eight of his final-third passes, and won 10 of his 17 duels, including two of three dribbles as he provided a constant outlet for Palace to springboard their attacks.
Their first campaign back in the top flight begins with defeat for Team_17, who will certainly need to show more in the final third if they're to respond with victory against Team_16 in their next game. Palace though, start as they mean to go on with three valuable points on the board already, ahead of a clash with London rivals Team_1 in their first home game of the season.
That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game! We'll see you soon for the next one, which won't be far away whatsoever - football is back!"	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	Exciting
93525	Burnley	Luton	2024-01-12	Turf Moor, Burnley	20155.0	Tony Harrington	"Hello and welcome to our LIVE commentary of the Premier League fixture between Burnley and Liverpool!
Three points for Nottingham Forest and Luton Town earlier on Tuesday have left Burnley second from bottom ahead of their Boxing Day fixture against Liverpool, five points adrift from safety. Vincent Kompany’s side will be looking to make it back-to-back victories for the first time this season after beating Fulham three days ago, in what was just their third win of the campaign.
Liverpool return to action three days after an engaging top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal, which ended 1-1 and left the Gunners top at Christmas. Klopp’s side have the chance to once again jump their opponents and finish the day in sole possession of first place with a first win in three, but will have to do so without a number of key players including both specialist left-backs.
With 15 minutes to go before kick-off, let’s take a look at how the two sides are lining up - starting with our hosts!
BURNLEY XI (4-4-2): James Trafford; Charlie Taylor, Jordan Beyer, Dara O’Shea, Vitinho; Wilson Odobert, Josh Brownhill, Sander Berge, Mike Tresor; Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Lyle Foster.
BURNLEY SUBS: Josh Cullen, Arijanet Muric, Jay Rodriguez, Hannes Delcroix, Aaron Ramsey, Connor Roberts, Nathan Redmond, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Johann Gudmundsson.
LIVERPOOL XI (4-3-3): Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jarell Quansah, Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez; Harvey Elliott, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch; Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez.
LIVERPOOL SUBS: Ibrahima Konate, Curtis Jones, Luis Diaz, Dominik Szoboszlai, Luke Chambers, James McConnel, Conor Bradley, Diogo Jota, Caoimhin Kelleher.
Burnley make a single change from the XI that beat Fulham 2-0 last time out, with Tresor replacing Larsen on the right wing.
Liverpool make five alterations to the side that earned a 1-1 draw with Arsenal on December 23. Quansah gives Konate a rest at centre-back, while an injury to Kostas Tsimikas means Gomez is recruited in to play at left-back. Elliott and Gravenberch are tasked with playing either side of Endo instead of Jones and Szoboszlai, while Gakpo takes over for Diaz in attack.
Burnley get the match underway from the kick-off!
Amdouni drops deep to pick up possession before leading Odobert down the left flank with a pass and continuing his run, but the winger is unable to skip past two defenders, losing the ball on the edge of Liverpool’s penalty area.
Salah gets forward before laying it off to Gravenberch, whose first-time backheel pass finds Elliott in stride. An eventual shot from the midfielder is saved well by Trafford, who parries it out of danger, but the raised offside flag ends the move.
INCH-PERFECT FROM NUNEZ! 1-0 LIVERPOOL! Gakpo gets into the penalty area after a lovely one-two pass with Nunez and sizes up Vitinho before pulling a pass back to the edge of the penalty area. Having continued his run, the Uruguay international striker meets the ball with a first-time shot with his side foot, putting it just out of Trafford’s reach!
Gakpo is credited with the assist for a perfectly weighted ball back to the edge of the penalty area for Nunez.
PHENOMENAL STOP! The ball squirms through to Salah inside the 18-yard box after Gakpo and Nunez both lose possession and the winger meets it with an instinctive toe-poke. Not to be beaten again, Trafford flies across his line and uses one hand to palm the shot over the crossbar to keep the score at 1-0.
Alexander-Arnold sprays a trademark pass across the pitch for Gakpo, who times his run perfectly and shakes off Vitinho before hitting a difficult half-volley that sails high and wide of the target.
Burnley started the match with intent but have been pegged back early, with Nunez scoring with Liverpool’s second shot of the match. Kompany’s side have only managed to score more than once twice in their last 10 Premier League fixtures and will need to do so today to have any hope of the three points; both previous occasions resulted in wins for today’s hosts.
Odobert cuts inside and frees himself of Endo’s marking but his pass through the lines for Foster is intercepted expertly by Van Dijk.
Tresor sends his outswinging corner-kick to the edge of the six-yard box but the only man there to meet it is Gakpo, clearing it away effectively with a powerful header.
Nunez barges through the back of Taylor to win possession on the wing, with the referee allowing play to continue. The forward drives towards the byline and fires a cross across the face of goal for Gakpo, who can’t turn his effort towards goal.
Foster picks up possession and leads his side towards Liverpool’s 18-yard box with as many as three team-mates in support, but an unfortunate slip 24 yards from goal allows Quansah to easily come across and claim it for the visitors.
Elliott fires a shot from 20 yards out that skips through the legs of Beyer, taking it into the path of Gakpo. The winger contests it and looks to add the finishing touches to put it past Trafford but the goalkeeper comes off his line assertively and makes the eventual save.
Berge’s tackle on Gravenberch is worthy of the first yellow card of the match, with Paul Tierney showing the Burnley midfielder a booking.
Tresor cuts inside from the left and opens up space to the appreciation of the crowd before playing a pass into the feet of Foster. The striker looks to have some difficulty controlling the ball before turning to his right in search of Odobert, but Gomez easily intercepts.
Liverpool are in full control of possession with just under half an hour played, keeping their opponents chasing as they move the ball from left to right and back again. With a challenging and busy fixture list during the festive period, Klopp will be eager for his side to dictate play and slow the tempo whenever possible.
LIVERPOOL SCORE BUT IT WON’T COUNT! A scramble in Burnley’s penalty area leads to a shot from Gakpo, which is well saved by Trafford in the Burnley goal. The rebound falls to Nunez, who goes through the back of Taylor and plays a pass to Gakpo, with the winger eventually firing his second effort past the goalkeeper. The Netherlands international wheels away to celebrate, but it won’t count, with the referee spotting the foul from Nunez in the build-up.
Burnley have won just two of their 16 Premier League games against Liverpool (D2 L12), winning 2-0 at home in August 2016, and 1-0 away in January 2021.
Looking to play a one-two pass with Gravenberch in front of the technical area, Gakpo is bundled over by Vitinho, who has struggled to cope with his opponent in the opening period.
OFF THE BAR! Alisson slips during his drop-kick but still manages to find Gakpo out on the left wing, with the forward receiving the ball and cutting inside immediately to find space. He spots the run of Salah and chips a pass over the top of the defence for his team-mate, who meets it with a half-volley that cannons off the crossbar and goes behind!
Looking to hit quickly at the other end, Burnley build up down the right flank but Vitinho’s eventual cross is poor, with Tresor unable to keep it in play on the far side.
Gomez flashes a cross into the penalty area but Brownhill retreats and puts himself in the perfect place to clear it away.
Endo loses possession to Tresor, who comes forward on a Burnley counter-attack but he picks out the wrong pass to his left, putting it in-between and behind both Amdouni and Foster, allowing Quansah to step up and win it back.
Elliott’s inswinging corner is met somewhat unexpectedly by O’Shea, who manages to pop the ball straight up in the air for Trafford to gather.
Elliott picks out Salah’s overlapping run and the winger immediately fires a shot from a close angle looking to bend it into the far corner but once again Trafford is equal to it, making a definitive save after a kind deflection off Beyer.
Burnley will just look to keep the deficit at one ahead of the half-time interval, with just one minute to go before injury time. It’s been a difficult half for the hosts, who have found it exceedingly difficult to stop both Gakpo and Salah, while failing to turn counter-attacking opportunities into shots on target.
The fourth official indicates two minutes will be added to the end of the half for stoppages.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 0-1 LIVERPOOL.
A dominant Liverpool take a one-goal advantage into the half-time interval at Turf Moor, with Nunez’s sixth-minute strike the only difference on the scoresheet. Kompany’s side started with intent and looked to turn defence into attack with promise, but the early goal conceded would prove a difficult deficit to overcome. With their advantage, Liverpool exhibited confidence and aggression when attacking, clearly intent to double their advantage - with Gakpo playing an instrumental role and Salah hitting the crossbar. Trafford has been the only thing standing in the way of a much bigger lead for Klopp’s team at the break, with the goalkeeper making a tremendous seven saves.
Burnley will need more attacking output if they wish to pull one back against Liverpool, with Foster wasteful in possession in the first half. Rodriguez’s experience could be an asset in the second half, while Redmond’s direct play from the wing would provide a different challenge for opposing full-backs as opposed to Tresor or Odobert. Klopp will look to keep players fresh and rotate if at all possible with a match upcoming in five days, with Jones, Konate and the returning Jota all options from the bench.
Liverpool get the match restarted from the kick-off!
Liverpool are patient to start the second half, with both Gakpo and Alexander-Arnold denying opportunities to play it over the top of the defence to instead go short. The visitors will want to continue the pressure they put on in the first half, without leaving themselves vulnerable at the other end.
Alexander-Arnold gets forward down the right and shapes his body to play a curling cross to the far post but it gets beyond Gakpo and behind on the other side for a Burnley throw.
Nunez’s foul on Amdouni in midfield gives Burnley a chance to send their defenders up for a set-piece but the opportunity comes to nothing as Odobert is unable to bring down Trafford’s kick, returning possession to Gomez.
Gomez skips by Vitinho on the touchline and whacks a cross into the penalty area but without a team-mate in the area, Tresor is able to coolly control the ball and pass it backwards before sprinting forward to provide an option.
LIVERPOOL SCORE BUT IT WON’T COUNT! Endo’s incisive pass is met by Beyer’s touch, which takes it into the path of Elliott. The midfielder sprays it out to his right for Gravenberch before continuing his run and getting on the end of the cross to tuck it home, but his celebration is cut short - with Salah deemed to be in an offside position, unsighting the goalkeeper during the shot!
Liverpool are once again denied a second goal, after Gakpo’s finish was disallowed in the first half. Klopp will be desperate for a bit of insurance despite Burnley’s lack of real attacking threat - with the result hanging in the balance with just over 30 minutes to play.
CHANCE! Tresor’s outswinging corner is nodded on by O’Shea, with Beyer meeting it inside the six-yard box. The centre-back swings his leg and makes good contact with the ball, but the slightest of deflections from Nunez diverts its path and puts it behind for a second corner-kick in a row.
The first substitution of the match goes the way of Burnley, with Tresor making way for Gudmunds­son.
Gakpo’s cynical push through the back of Gudmundsson gives Burnley a chance to attack the Liverpool penalty area from a free-kick on the touchline, but the substitute’s delivery is poor - with Van Dijk able to easily clear the danger.
Burnley have lost five of their last seven league games on Boxing Day (one win and one draw), with their only win in that time coming against Middlesbrough in the Premier League in 2016/17.
Trafford steps well outside of his penalty area and whacks the ball long into Liverpool’s 18-yard box, where a nonchalant pass back from Gomez immediately puts Alisson in trouble. With no other option, the Liverpool goalkeeper is forced to just put it out for a throw-in, which moves Burnley higher up the pitch.
Gravenberch is recalled to the bench with 23 minutes remaining. Jones is his replacement.
Elliott makes way, somewhat disappointed after his goal was chalked off. Diaz will see out the remainder of the game.
Szoboszlai comes into Liverpool's midfield to add a bit of fresh legs and creativity, with Gakpo chosen for an early rest.
BURNLEY SQUANDER A GILT-EDGED CHANCE! Odobert takes on and beats Alexander-Arnold, getting into the penalty area near the byline before flashing a cross to the far post. With Alisson slow to get across his line, all Gudmundsson has to do is hit the target to score, but he blazes his opportunity over the crossbar!
Burnley have looked better as the second half has progressed, contesting 50–50 opportunities and putting Alisson under real pressure. Gudmundsson should really have levelled the score and given Kompany’s side a platform for which to search for all three points, though even still a result is not out of the question, with Liverpool seeming somewhat lax.
CHANCE! Alexander-Arnold strides forward and plays an inch-perfect cross to the far post for Nunez, who unselfishly heads the ball across the face of goal for Szoboszlai. With the entire net to aim at, the Hungary international makes contact but he’s unable to tuck it home thanks to O’Shea’s close marking!
After failing to score in five of seven Premier League away games between January and April, Liverpool have found the net in each of their last 13 on the road, netting 30 goals in the process.
O’Shea is called for a foul on the byline after pushing Nunez with two hands before jumping into a sliding challenge. It’s a free-kick for Liverpool in a dangerous position, with Alexander-Arnold tasked with delivering it.
Alexander-Arnold chips the free-kick into the penalty area but the imposing Berge is first to the ball, heading it clear without fuss.
Alexander-Arnold's swing of the leg catches Foster, who was on his way towards the 18-yard box. It's a yellow card for the Liverpool right-back, and a free-kick for Burnley.
Brownhill curls the ensuing set-piece into the penalty area looking for Berge, but the Burnley captain puts his delivery too far beyond the midfielder and behind for a goal-kick.
With just 10 minutes to go, Klopp is still prowling his touchline and barking out instructions to his players. It’s been a closely contested fixture - partly thanks to the two disallowed goals - which is a credit to the hosts, though they’ll need points and not plaudits if they wish to stay in the Premier League.
Szoboszlai charges forward into space in midfield and strikes the ball cleanly from 25 yards out but pressure from Berge forces the substitute to send his shot wide of the post.
Jota comes on for the first time since his injury over a month ago, with Nunez taken off despite the goal to his name.
Kompany continues to roll the dice with his side behind by one. This time, Larsen is introduced for Amdouni.
Looking to add a bit more pace down the wings, Burnley also swap Foster with Redmond.
SO CLOSE! Endo’s giveaway just outside of Liverpool’s penalty area gives Burnley a chance to test Alisson but Larsen opts to rush his shot, sending it narrowly wide of the post!
Alexander-Arnold’s inswinging corner-kick is met by Van Dijk, who can’t do much more than make contact with it thanks to the pace and power. It’s a good opportunity but it sails behind for a goal-kick, much to Trafford’s delight.
LIVERPOOL HAVE THEIR SECOND! 2-0! Only on the pitch for six minutes, Jota finds the back of the net in his return from injury, receiving the ball in midfield and finding Diaz before continuing on an overlapping run down the left. With poise and presence of mind, the Colombia international spots his team-mate and lays it off to him using his backheel, with Jota able to beat Trafford from a tight angle!
Two substitutes combine as Diaz picks up the assist for Jota's goal.
O'Shea is shown a yellow card for a cynical challenge on Endo, upending the Japan international.
A late change for Burnley sees Ramsey replace Brownhill.
The fourth official indicates five minutes will be added to the end of the match for stoppages.
Gudmundsson spots Redmond in the penalty area but the winger isn’t able to get the ball out from under his feet, opting to give it back to his team-mate instead of firing a shot. The eventual cross comes in but it’s a poor one sent right into the awaiting arms of Alisson at his near post.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 0-2 LIVERPOOL.
Liverpool have two goals chalked off for offside but still manage to secure the three points, beating Burnley at Turf Moor by two goals to nil. Kompany’s side showed early intent but much of that good work was undone after just six minutes, when Nunez placed his shot perfectly to beat Trafford and take the lead. The Burnley goalkeeper was certainly busy in the contest, making eight saves as well as conceding on two other occasions, with both Gakpo and Elliott denied thanks to offside calls in the build-up. The hosts had their chances to equalise - with Gudmundsson’s close-range header the pick of the bunch, but they were unable to capitalise on their infrequent opportunities, failing to force Alisson into a save. It would come back to cost them, with Jota’s goal on the stroke of the 90th minute sealing the win for Liverpool. The points take Klopp’s side up to first in the table, while Burnley stay 19th after the loss. That concludes our commentary of the Premier League fixture between Burnley and Liverpool, we hope you’ve enjoyed it!"	"Carlton Morris’s header in second-half stoppage time rescued a crucial point for Luton Town against relegation rivals Burnley as they drew 1-1 at Turf Moor.
Zeki Amdouni’s first-half strike gave Burnley the lead but a controversial equaliser from Morris moves Luton level on points with 17th-place Everton.
It was a missed opportunity for Burnley, who could have moved a point from their opponents in the battle to avoid relegation.
How the match unfolded
In an open start to the contest, Burnley had the first great chance to open the scoring after just seven minutes as Johann Gudmundsson was played through on goal, but his effort was straight at Thomas Kaminski.
Luton immediately countered off the back of Gudmundsson’s miss, but Alfie Doughty’s low cross was just beyond the reach of Elijah Adebayo.
later, James Trafford made his first save of the match when he dived to his left to deny Ross Barkley’s long-range strike.
The Hatters were the better side for the next 20 minutes of the match, pinning Burnley inside their own half, but they were unable to capitalise on their dominance. 
Luton were made to pay in the 36th minute when Zeki Amdouni put Burnley ahead. Wilson Odobert ran down the left wing and cut the ball back to the Swiss forward in the middle of the box and Kaminski was unable to stop his first-time effort.
Vitinho had two chances to double Burnley’s lead early in the second half, but neither of his efforts were good enough to beat Kaminski.
Then Luton’s ‘keeper was almost caught off-guard when Odobert’s deflected shot headed toward the near post, but Kaminski did well to scramble across his line and tip the ball behind for a corner.
Lyle Foster tried his luck with a volley inside the box following a well-worked free-kick routine but Kaminski was able to catch the effort from the striker.
Chances were at a premium for Luton in the second half as miscommunication between Dara O’Shea and Hjalmar Ekdal almost allowed Albert Sambi Lokonga to run through on goal, but the Luton midfielder was not strong enough to get past the Burnley defenders.
But in the second minute of stoppage time, Morris got on the end of Doughty’s cross to level the scoreline. 
Burnley players were unhappy as they felt Trafford had been fouled by Adebayo, but after a VAR review the decision by referee Tony Harrington allowed the goal to stand.
That goal also meant Luton have struck 10 times in the final 10 minutes of Premier League games this season, with only Liverpool having scored more, with 13.
The draw keeps Luton in 18th, level on points and one place behind Everton. Burnley remain in 19th with 12 points, four points away from the Toffees.

Three points for Team_16 and Team_12 earlier on Tuesday have left Team_6 second from bottom ahead of their Boxing Day fixture against Team_11, five points adrift from safety. Vincent Kompany’s side will be looking to make it back-to-back victories for the first time this season after beating Team_10 three days ago, in what was just their third win of the campaign.
Team_11 return to action three days after an engaging top-of-the-table clash with Team_1, which ended 1-1 and left the Gunners top at Christmas.

Quansah gives Konate a rest at centre-back, while an injury to Kostas Tsimikas means Gomez is recruited in to play at left-back. Elliott and Gravenberch are tasked with playing either side of Endo instead of Jones and Szoboszlai, while Gakpo takes over for Diaz in attack.
Team_6 get the match underway from the kick-off!

Kompany’s side have only managed to score more than once twice in their last 10 Premier League fixtures and will need to do so today to have any hope of the three points; both previous occasions resulted in wins for today’s hosts.
Odobert cuts inside and frees himself of Endo’s marking but his pass through the lines for Foster is intercepted expertly by Van Dijk.
Tresor sends his outswinging corner-kick to the edge of the six-yard box but the only man there to meet it is Gakpo, clearing it away effectively with a powerful header.

The rebound falls to Nunez, who goes through the back of Taylor and plays a pass to Gakpo, with the winger eventually firing his second effort past the goalkeeper. The Netherlands international wheels away to celebrate, but it won’t count, with the referee spotting the foul from Nunez in the build-up.
Team_6 have won just two of their 16 Premier League games against Team_11 (D2 L12), winning 2-0 at home in August 2016, and 1-0 away in January 2021.
Looking to play a one-two pass with Gravenberch in front of the technical area, Gakpo is bundled over by Vitinho, who has struggled to cope with his opponent in the opening period.
OFF THE BAR! Alisson slips during his drop-kick but still manages to find Gakpo out on the left wing, with the forward receiving the ball and cutting inside immediately to find space. He spots the run of Salah and chips a pass over the top of the defence for his team-mate, who meets it with a half-volley that cannons off the crossbar and goes behind!
Looking to hit quickly at the other end, Team_6 build up down the right flank but Vitinho’s eventual cross is poor, with Tresor unable to keep it in play on the far side.
Gomez flashes a cross into the penalty area but Brownhill retreats and puts himself in the perfect place to clear it away.
Endo loses possession to Tresor, who comes forward on a Team_6 counter-attack but he picks out the wrong pass to his left, putting it in-between and behind both Amdouni and Foster, allowing Quansah to step up and win it back.
Elliott’s inswinging corner is met somewhat unexpectedly by O’Shea, who manages to pop the ball straight up in the air for Trafford to gather.
Elliott picks out Salah’s overlapping run and the winger immediately fires a shot from a close angle looking to bend it into the far corner but once again Trafford is equal to it, making a definitive save after a kind deflection off Beyer.
Team_6 will just look to keep the deficit at one ahead of the half-time interval, with just one minute to go before injury time. It’s been a difficult half for the hosts, who have found it exceedingly difficult to stop both Gakpo and Salah, while failing to turn counter-attacking opportunities into shots on target.
The fourth official indicates two minutes will be added to the end of the half for stoppages.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 0-1 Team_11.
A dominant Team_11 take a one-goal advantage into the half-time interval at Turf Moor, with Nunez’s sixth-minute strike the only difference on the scoresheet. Kompany’s side started with intent and looked to turn defence into attack with promise, but the early goal conceded would prove a difficult deficit to overcome. With their advantage, Team_11 exhibited confidence and aggression when attacking, clearly intent to double their advantage - with Gakpo playing an instrumental role and Salah hitting the crossbar. Trafford has been the only thing standing in the way of a much bigger lead for Klopp’s team at the break, with the goalkeeper making a tremendous seven saves.
Team_6 will need more attacking output if they wish to pull one back against Team_11, with Foster wasteful in possession in the first half. Rodriguez’s experience could be an asset in the second half, while Redmond’s direct play from the wing would provide a different challenge for opposing full-backs as opposed to Tresor or Odobert. Klopp will look to keep players fresh and rotate if at all possible with a match upcoming in five days, with Jones, Konate and the returning Jota all options from the bench.
Team_11 get the match restarted from the kick-off!
Team_11 are patient to start the second half, with both Gakpo and Alexander-Arnold denying opportunities to play it over the top of the defence to instead go short. The visitors will want to continue the pressure they put on in the first half, without leaving themselves vulnerable at the other end.
Alexander-Arnold gets forward down the right and shapes his body to play a curling cross to the far post but it gets beyond Gakpo and behind on the other side for a Team_6 throw.
Nunez’s foul on Amdouni in midfield gives Team_6 a chance to send their defenders up for a set-piece but the opportunity comes to nothing as Odobert is unable to bring down Trafford’s kick, returning possession to Gomez.
Gomez skips by Vitinho on the touchline and whacks a cross into the penalty area but without a team-mate in the area, Tresor is able to coolly control the ball and pass it backwards before sprinting forward to provide an option.
Team_11 SCORE BUT IT WON’T COUNT! Endo’s incisive pass is met by Beyer’s touch, which takes it into the path of Elliott. The midfielder sprays it out to his right for Gravenberch before continuing his run and getting on the end of the cross to tuck it home, but his celebration is cut short - with Salah deemed to be in an offside position, unsighting the goalkeeper during the shot!
Team_11 are once again denied a second goal, after Gakpo’s finish was disallowed in the first half. Klopp will be desperate for a bit of insurance despite Team_6’s lack of real attacking threat - with the result hanging in the balance with just over 30 minutes to play.
CHANCE! Tresor’s outswinging corner is nodded on by O’Shea, with Beyer meeting it inside the six-yard box. The centre-back swings his leg and makes good contact with the ball, but the slightest of deflections from Nunez diverts its path and puts it behind for a second corner-kick in a row.
The first substitution of the match goes the way of Team_6, with Tresor making way for Gudmunds­son.
Gakpo’s cynical push through the back of Gudmundsson gives Team_6 a chance to attack the Team_11 penalty area from a free-kick on the touchline, but the substitute’s delivery is poor - with Van Dijk able to easily clear the danger.
Team_6 have lost five of their last seven league games on Boxing Day (one win and one draw), with their only win in that time coming against Middlesbrough in the Premier League in 2016/17.
Trafford steps well outside of his penalty area and whacks the ball long into Team_11’s 18-yard box, where a nonchalant pass back from Gomez immediately puts Alisson in trouble. With no other option, the Team_11 goalkeeper is forced to just put it out for a throw-in, which moves Team_6 higher up the pitch.
Gravenberch is recalled to the bench with 23 minutes remaining. Jones is his replacement.
Elliott makes way, somewhat disappointed after his goal was chalked off. Diaz will see out the remainder of the game.
Szoboszlai comes into Team_11 midfield to add a bit of fresh legs and creativity, with Gakpo chosen for an early rest.
Team_6 SQUANDER A GILT-EDGED CHANCE! Odobert takes on and beats Alexander-Arnold, getting into the penalty area near the byline before flashing a cross to the far post. With Alisson slow to get across his line, all Gudmundsson has to do is hit the target to score, but he blazes his opportunity over the crossbar!
Team_6 have looked better as the second half has progressed, contesting 50–50 opportunities and putting Alisson under real pressure. Gudmundsson should really have levelled the score and given Kompany’s side a platform for which to search for all three points, though even still a result is not out of the question, with Team_11 seeming somewhat lax.
CHANCE! Alexander-Arnold strides forward and plays an inch-perfect cross to the far post for Nunez, who unselfishly heads the ball across the face of goal for Szoboszlai. With the entire net to aim at, the Hungary international makes contact but he’s unable to tuck it home thanks to O’Shea’s close marking!
After failing to score in five of seven Premier League away games between January and April, Team_11 have found the net in each of their last 13 on the road, netting 30 goals in the process.
O’Shea is called for a foul on the byline after pushing Nunez with two hands before jumping into a sliding challenge. It’s a free-kick for Team_11 in a dangerous position, with Alexander-Arnold tasked with delivering it.
Alexander-Arnold chips the free-kick into the penalty area but the imposing Berge is first to the ball, heading it clear without fuss.
Alexander-Arnold's swing of the leg catches Foster, who was on his way towards the 18-yard box. It's a yellow card for the Team_11 right-back, and a free-kick for Team_6.
Brownhill curls the ensuing set-piece into the penalty area looking for Berge, but the Team_6 captain puts his delivery too far beyond the midfielder and behind for a goal-kick.
With just 10 minutes to go, Klopp is still prowling his touchline and barking out instructions to his players. It’s been a closely contested fixture - partly thanks to the two disallowed goals - which is a credit to the hosts, though they’ll need points and not plaudits if they wish to stay in the Premier League.
Szoboszlai charges forward into space in midfield and strikes the ball cleanly from 25 yards out but pressure from Berge forces the substitute to send his shot wide of the post.
Jota comes on for the first time since his injury over a month ago, with Nunez taken off despite the goal to his name.
Kompany continues to roll the dice with his side behind by one. This time, Larsen is introduced for Amdouni.
Looking to add a bit more pace down the wings, Team_6 also swap Foster with Redmond.
SO CLOSE! Endo’s giveaway just outside of Team_11’s penalty area gives Team_6 a chance to test Alisson but Larsen opts to rush his shot, sending it narrowly wide of the post!
Alexander-Arnold’s inswinging corner-kick is met by Van Dijk, who can’t do much more than make contact with it thanks to the pace and power. It’s a good opportunity but it sails behind for a goal-kick, much to Trafford’s delight.
Team_11 HAVE THEIR SECOND! 2-0! Only on the pitch for six minutes, Jota finds the back of the net in his return from injury, receiving the ball in midfield and finding Diaz before continuing on an overlapping run down the left. With poise and presence of mind, the Colombia international spots his team-mate and lays it off to him using his backheel, with Jota able to beat Trafford from a tight angle!
Two substitutes combine as Diaz picks up the assist for Jota's goal.
O'Shea is shown a yellow card for a cynical challenge on Endo, upending the Japan international.
A late change for Team_6 sees Ramsey replace Brownhill.
The fourth official indicates five minutes will be added to the end of the match for stoppages.
Gudmundsson spots Redmond in the penalty area but the winger isn’t able to get the ball out from under his feet, opting to give it back to his team-mate instead of firing a shot. The eventual cross comes in but it’s a poor one sent right into the awaiting arms of Alisson at his near post.
FULL-TIME: Team_6 0-2 Team_11.
Team_11 have two goals chalked off for offside but still manage to secure the three points, beating Team_6 at Turf Moor by two goals to nil. Kompany’s side showed early intent but much of that good work was undone after just six minutes, when Nunez placed his shot perfectly to beat Trafford and take the lead. The Team_6 goalkeeper was certainly busy in the contest, making eight saves as well as conceding on two other occasions, with both Gakpo and Elliott denied thanks to offside calls in the build-up. The hosts had their chances to equalise - with Gudmundsson’s close-range header the pick of the bunch, but they were unable to capitalise on their infrequent opportunities, failing to force Alisson into a save. It would come back to cost them, with Jota’s goal on the stroke of the 90th minute sealing the win for Team_11. The points take Klopp’s side up to first in the table, while Team_6 stay 19th after the loss. That concludes our commentary of the Premier League fixture between Team_6 and Team_11, we hope you’ve enjoyed it!"	0	0	1	0	0	1	2	Exciting
93497	Nott'm Forest	Bournemouth	2023-12-23	The City Ground, Nottingham	29188.0	Robert Jones	"Hello and welcome to this live text commentary of the Premier League match between Tottenham and Newcastle United!
Both teams come into this game dealing with awful injury crises, which have contributed to testing runs in recent weeks. That is especially true of Spurs, who are winless in five – this, remarkably, despite scoring first in each of those matches.
Newcastle have dealt a little better with their selection issues, even with a packed schedule, but a late 3-0 defeat at Everton on Thursday bore resemblance to a previous loss at Bournemouth last month when fatigue looked to have got the better of Eddie Howe's men.
With injuries at the forefront of both coaches' minds, let's get the team news...
TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Ben Davies, Destiny Udogie; Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr; Dejan Kulusevski, Brennan Johnson, Richarlison; Son Heung-min.
TOTTENHAM SUBS: Fraser Forster, Oliver Skipp, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Bryan Gil, Emerson Royal, Giovani Lo Celso, Alejo Veliz, Jamie Donley, Alfie Dorrington.
NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schar, Valentino Livramento; Lewis Miley, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton; Miguel Almiron, Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon.
NEWCASTLE UNITED SUBS: Loris Karius, Mark Gillespie, Paul Dummett, Callum Wilson, Matt Ritchie, Emil Krafth, Lewis Hall, Sean Longstaff, Alex Murphy.
There is good news for Spurs as captain Son is fit to start despite sustaining a knock against West Ham. He is joined in the line-up by Sarr and Richarlison, making their first starts since returning from their respective injuries. Hojbjerg and Lo Celso make way.
Newcastle's injury woes also show some signs of easing, even if they name an unchanged XI, keeping the same 10 outfielders for a fifth straight match in all competitions. Lascelles has recovered from a dead leg to lead the team, while Wilson and Longstaff are on the bench, where Howe has been so short of options.
Isak kicks off for Newcastle, and the game is under way.
Newcastle begin this game in seventh but will displace fifth-placed Tottenham with a win. Spurs are looking to close the six-point gap to the top four.
Spurs have had no trouble starting fast, and they are straight on the attack. It looks as though Richarlison will line up through the middle, with Son playing from the left. There is certainly flexibility within that front four.
Guimaraes blocks from Richarlison! A smart pass from Son finds Udogie, whose flick in turn tees up Richarlison on the edge of the box. Brazil team-mate Guimaraes intervenes, though, and Richarlison cannot bundle through the Newcastle defence when the ball comes back to him.
Richarlison denied again! Son is making a really bright start on the left and his flick sends Kulusevski away to feed Richarlison. The angle is narrowing, however, and Schar deflects the shot over.
There is a scramble in the box from Tottenham's corner, but no home player can get hold of the ball in order to take a shot. They are still well on top.
So close! A first Newcastle attack almost brings a first Newcastle goal. Gordon and Joelinton link up on the left, with the latter teeing up Guimaraes from 20 yards. He is able to run onto the ball but slices his shot, sending it just past the top-right corner.
History suggests we should expect goals from this one. Of fixtures to be played 50 or more times in the Premier League, matches between Newcastle and Tottenham average the most goals at 3.16 per game. Their past seven meetings have averaged 4.43 goals!
WHAT A CHANCE! Isak has to score! Newcastle get in behind for the first time with Gordon, set away by Joelinton. He charges forward and crosses towards Isak, but Davies gets the slightest touch, meaning Isak's finish from in front of a gaping goal skips away off the outside of his boot. Agonising.
Both teams are finding joy down their respective left flanks. Son and Gordon look the two danger men at this early stage.
Schar has a problem. He takes his time looking for a pass just inside the Newcastle box and takes a whack from Kulusevski when he belatedly hacks the ball into touch. Schar stays down, indicating a knock to his back.
After a short stoppage, Schar is back up on his feet without requiring treatment. Newcastle can scarcely afford another injury.
Brilliant work from Almiron. Tottenham counter from a Newcastle free-kick, and Son has the opportunity to run at Schar, who still is not moving comfortably. Almiron races back to tackle the Spurs captain, and Son frustratedly catches him with an arm as he seeks to regain possession by the corner flag.
Johnson smartly gets away from Livramento, only for his cross to be nodded away by Trippier. Spurs attack again on the right, and Livramento is this time only close enough to deflect Porro's cross behind.
OFF THE LINE! Almiron intervenes to deny Romero another goal. The Spurs centre-back scored against West Ham from a set-piece and is up highest again, nodding towards the bottom-right corner, yet Almiron is on hand to clear.
Newcastle have carried a threat on the break and should really be ahead, but the vast majority of the game is being played within 40 yards of Dubravka's goal. A teasing Son cross just evades Richarlison.
Even when Newcastle enjoy some possession, ""enjoy"" is perhaps the wrong word. They are struggling to get out, with Trippier visibly frustrated by the lack of options in midfield.
The pace of the two attacks is making this a great watch. Despite Newcastle's difficulties on the ball, neither team want to sit back and defend, so there is plenty of space for the likes of Johnson and Gordon to run into.
Joelinton is the latest player to go down, remaining grounded as play accelerates from one end to the other. An Udogie pass comes to nothing, then Almiron is tracked down by Bissouma. Joelinton is soon back on his feet.
Romero leaves Almiron in a heap after Miley's lovely reverse pass allows the winger to advance into the Tottenham half. There is no action beyond a free-kick, from which Lascelles cannot control in the box.
GOOAAALLLL!!! Udogie scores and Tottenham strike first again! 1-0! The left-back first takes the ball outside the box in the middle of the pitch but moves it wide to Son and then keeps moving. His run is not tracked, and Udogie is there to convert from Son's low cross, with Dubravka beaten by the speed and accuracy of the delivery.
Son has been a threat from the outset, and he breezes past Trippier and sends in a brilliant cross.
Newcastle seek a response, with Almiron feeding Miley on the right. A low cross bounces straight through the box to Gordon, whose pass allows Joelinton to shoot from the edge of the box. His effort deflects over.
The Newcastle corner following Joelinton's cross comes to nothing as a foul is given against the midfielder, who is close to Vicario.
Wide from Sarr! Tottenham have players lining up in the middle, but Sarr is perhaps not the man they want to take the shot. Johnson delays his cross, and the recipient cannot get enough on his attempt, sending it past the left-hand post.
That speed in the Tottenham attack is such a problem for Newcastle. Every time they look to get players forward, they are vulnerable on the counter. Son tries to take on Lascelles but instead runs the ball out of play.
BIG CHANCE! Almiron shoots too close to Vicario! To their credit, Newcastle keep trying to press and eventually get their reward when Spurs cede possession. Isak moves the ball on to Gordon, who feeds Almiron. The winger is through on goal but shoots early, and it is ultimately a simple save.
Offside flags frustrate the attackers at either end. Another rapid Tottenham move is halted when Richarlison and Son combine in the box, before Almiron is offside at the other end following a more patient move.
GOOAAALLLL!!! There is the vital second goal! Richarlison makes it 2-0 to Tottenham! It is another goal that comes from the left, with Son wriggling past Trippier, who had let the winger in initially with a poor header. Son cuts the ball back to Richarlison, who sweeps past a stationary Dubravka.
The decision to play Son from the left, rather than through the middle, has certainly been rewarded so far. He is giving Trippier a torrid time and collects his second assist.
Trippier was at fault for all three Everton goals in Newcastle's previous match, and he cannot get to grips with Son here, although he is not alone. Newcastle look so untidy at the back.
A whisker wide! Johnson blasts just past the post from 20 yards after Sarr bullies Joelinton off the ball. Dubravka is beaten but so is the post.
Kulusevski shoots straight at Dubravka! Newcastle are really on the ropes now. Schar takes a heavy touch and is robbed of possession, the ball bouncing kindly for Kulusevski in the box, but he does not quite get hold of the shot.
How have Tottenham not scored again?! Joelinton is on the move at one end but underhits his pass to Almiron, allowing Son to race away. There is no catching the Spurs captain, who slips in Kulusevski. A clipped cross takes a deflection but looks certain to find either a Tottenham shirt or the far corner. Richarlison cannot contort his body to make contact, however, and the ball drops wide.
Richarlison gets his head to the corner that follows his chance but aims straight at Dubravka.
There will be three additional minutes at the end of the half.
Trippier's pass towards Miley is cut out by Bissouma but runs behind for a corner. Trippier takes the set-piece, too, but it bounces off Lascelles and exits the box on the far side. Lascelles is at least able to block Son's clearance to slow Spurs.
HALF-TIME: TOTTENHAM 2-0 NEWCASTLE UNITED
The first big chance may have gone Newcastle's way, when Isak could not convert, but it has been one-way traffic since then. Tottenham are 2-0 up after two very similar goals. Twice Son ran at Trippier, twice he made space for a cross, and twice he found a team-mate for a first-time finish. Udogie got the opener, but Spurs have had no trouble netting first. The vital goal will perhaps be the second, which Richarlison grabbed to give Tottenham a commanding half-time lead.
Tottenham will hope they turned a corner in that first half, while Newcastle have a mountain to climb. They have lost 55 of the previous 56 Premier League away games in which they have been two or more goals down at half-time, recovering to take a point only against Liverpool in 2016.
Richarlison gets the game restarted, with no changes for either side.
In an attempt to restore some energy to this Newcastle XI, Howe has made one alteration: swapping Isak and Gordon. It was a move he tried at Everton, too, to limited success.
Newcastle enjoy a rare passage of possession, making Spurs work for once. Eventually, Trippier crosses but is challenged by Udogie, sending the ball behind for a corner.
Trippier's corner is comfortably cleared, but a delivery from Isak threatens to cause a little more trouble. Porro does well to clear.
A key theme of the first half remains. Newcastle lose the ball, and Spurs break. Johnson nods the ball down to Richarlison in the box, but Guimaraes just intervenes.
Gordon is now leading the line for Newcastle, and he gets on the end of a pass from Guimaraes and wins a foul in a dangerous position on the right.
Trippier whips in a free-kick from the right, but Bissouma is up highest to clear. Tottenham cannot easily get out this time, though, and Newcastle keep up the pressure. A deep cross from Trippier eventually finds Gordon, who can only volley over from the tighest of angles.
Newcastle are getting in again and again now. The ball is worked to Trippier once more, but his end product is lacking. Davies cuts out a poor cross.
Guimaraes is really fortunate to prevent a Tottenham counter on two occasions. Trippier's corner is cleared, and when Newcastle seek to build again, Guimaraes slips and almost gives up possession, clattering into a challenge. He bounces back up and dives in again, making the slightest of touches to divert the ball away from a Spurs player.
Back come Spurs. A low cross from the right is cut out, but they build again, the ball eventually reaching Bissouma for a relatively tame shot that bobbles through to Dubravka.
The problem remains the same for Newcastle. They have no option but to attack, and that means Spurs can counter. Schar gives the ball away, and Lascelles has to lunge in to stop a break. Tottenham take their throw-in quickly to get on the attack, only for Kulusevski's pass to go astray.
Newcastle are at least providing a threat, again working the ball to the right, where Miley can cross. The ball is nodded behind for a corner.
Lascelles goes into the book, with one of the most blatant yellow cards you are likely to see. A Newcastle corner leads to a Tottenham counter when Almiron loses possession. Lascelles drags back Son, determined not to let him get away, and is carded.
GOOAAALLLL!!! That should be it! Richarlison again! 3-0! Tottenham have been on the back foot at times at the start of this second half, but one long ball in behind finds Richarlison, who is between Lascelles and Dubravka and slides the ball beyond the stranded goalkeeper.
A searching pass from Porro plays Richarlison in. It is a great ball, even if Richarlison's poor first touch briefly threatens to let Newcastle off the hook.
OFF THE POST! Tottenham almost have a fourth through Johnson! This deserves a goal as Spurs pounce following Trippier's slack pass. Kulusevski races forward and slides Johnson in behind Livramento. Johnson shoots high past Dubravka, only to see the ball bounce back out off the post.
Tottenham are rampant! Moments after Johnson goes so close, a diagonal ball to Son gives him the chance to volley goalwards, missing the far corner from a tricky angle.
Newcastle make a double change with the game surely gone. Howe welcomes back Wilson from injury, replacing Isak.
Almiron is also withdrawn as Longstaff returns to the fold. A rejig sees Joelinton go to the left and Gordon to the right, with Wilson up front and Longstaff in midfield.
Tottenham are playing with so much confidence, although Porro is surely not going for the top corner as his cross causes Dubravka some concern, drifting onto the roof of the net.
Kulusevski is really enjoying himself in a central creative role, working room for a shot this time but finding only Dubravka's gloves from outside the area.
It is Son's turn to shoot, but he drags a low effort and allows Dubravka to save easily. This feels as though it could end up any scoreline now when Newcastle were previously looking to get back into the game.
Joelinton is the second Newcastle player to be booked after thundering into Porro in pursuit of Gordon's deep cross. It initially looks a little harsh, but a replay shows Joelinton clearly shoves his opponent as the ball comes their way.
Newcastle are keeping the ball, but they do not look remotely like threatening the Tottenham goal. This has been another tough outing for Howe's side.
With the result seemingly secure, Spurs are also able to rest key men. Sarr, who was making his first start in a month, bows out for Hojbjerg.
The second Tottenham change also involves a man who returned to the line-up for this game. Lo Celso is on for two-goal star Richarlison.
Another double change for Newcastle sees Livramento replaced by Hall at left-back.
Gordon makes way for Ritchie in what is surely the clearest sign Newcastle are turning their thoughts towards a big game against Milan in the Champions League.
Tottenham are playing with Newcastle! Johnson skips past Hall, who then goes chasing the ball and ends up being easily beaten again. Porro nutmegs Miley and then drives in a low shot that Dubravka spills but is able to recover.
Joelinton takes aim from distance, but a deflection sends it well wide. It is an optimistic attempt at best, just about summing up Newcastle's attacking efforts.
Joelinton has a far better chance from a Newcastle corner, but he heads wide! The midfielder-turned-winger is up highest, yet his header misses the far post by some distance.
Again Joelinton is involved as he wins a free-kick in a promising position, but a brilliant Trippier cross just creeps away from Schar.
Romero is booked for an awful challenge on Wilson, but he could be in trouble as there is a VAR check.
Both teams are perhaps ultimately relieved there is no action from the VAR as Romero lunges in on Wilson, who is already on the ground, and catches his ankle. Guimaraes then sticks his head in on Bissouma, but neither incident warrants a red card, according to the officials.
Newcastle eventually work a crossing opportunity from the free-kick that follows Romero's challenge, but Vicario gathers at the second attempt.
Trippier is the latest man to dive in, and he earns a booking for his challenge on Kulusevski. That card brings with it a suspension for the right-back.
PENALTY! Spurs have the chance for a fourth! Son gets in, Dubravka is slow to advance, and the goalkeeper brings the attacker down as he attempts to go around him. It is brilliant again from Son and poor again from Dubravka.
GOOAAALLLL!!! Son converts! The man felled for the penalty fires low past Dubravka's dive, making it 4-0 and capping a sublime day for Spurs and a miserable one for Newcastle.
The fourth goal signals further changes as Bissouma is withdrawn for Gil.
Trippier will get a rest next week when he is suspended, and he departs early now, too, with Krafth on in his place.
Another Tottenham change sees Johnson make way for Skipp.
This looked like a damage limitation job for Newcastle even before that fourth goal, and now they are belatedly sitting deep and looking to prevent Spurs scoring a fifth.
Dubravka denies Skipp! The Tottenham midfielder is all alone in the area from a deep cross, but the goalkeeper races out this time, quick enough to close the angle and block the shot with his leg.
Tottenham are not done at four! Son wriggles between Schar and Lascelles to create an angle for a shot but slides his effort the wrong side of the post. So close.
Another Tottenham move gets them in on the right, with Porro played in by Gil. It is not clear if the right-back is shooting or crossing, though, as he finds neither the target nor a team-mate.
There will be a minimum of five minutes of added time.
Son receives a well deserved standing ovation as he is replaced by Donley for stoppage time.
GOAL! Joelinton nets a consolation! Newcastle pull it back to 4-1. Longstaff wins the ball in the final third, and Ritchie plays in Wilson, who unselfishly squares to Joelinton. A fine first-time finish at least gets Newcastle on the board.
Wilson looks as though he might be offside as he receives the ball, but the goal is cleared by the VAR following the forward's cute square pass.
Despite the scoreline, neither team seem particularly happy to play out time. Guimaraes feeds Wilson, who cannot quite work space for a shot inside the box.
Wilson heads straight at Vicario from Ritchie's cross! It is a great opportunity and one that might earn a little more attention if not for the state of the game.
FULL-TIME: TOTTENHAM 4-1 NEWCASTLE UNITED
Tottenham finally return to winning ways in some style. They were beaten home and away by Newcastle last season but outclassed them this time, scoring in the first half through Udogie and Richarlison after fine work from Son. Richarlison got another just when Newcastle were looking for a route back into the match in the second period, then Son got a deserved goal for himself from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Dubravka. Newcastle could have scored early but ultimately had to settle for Joelinton's consolation. As Spurs look forward to Friday's trip to Nottingham Forest, Newcastle must first lift themselves to play Milan in the Champions League. That is all from this game. Goodbye!"	"Dominic Solanke scored his first senior hat-trick as AFC Bournemouth earned a thrilling late 3-2 win over 10-man Nottingham Forest to spoil Nuno Espirito Santo’s first match in charge.
The Cherries striker scored twice in the space of eight second-half minutes to put the visitors 2-1 up. Then, after Forest equalised through Chris Wood, Solanke scored a dramatic winner in the fourth minute of stoppage time as Andoni Iraola’s side secured a third straight victory.
How the match unfolded
Nuno endured a nightmare start to his first match in match of Forest as centre-back Willy Boly was shown a second yellow card in the 23rd minute following a tackle on Adam Smith.
But Forest remained resilient in the first half, and the closest Bournemouth came to taking the lead was through a long-range strike from Antoine Semenyo, who shot just wide of the left post.
Against the odds, Nuno’s side claimed a shock lead through Anthony Elanga. Wood did very well to win the ball back deep in Bournemouth territory before sliding the ball through to Elanga, who kept his composure and slid the ball into the bottom-left corner.
But Forest’s lead only lasted four minutes as Solanke produced a superb header that looped over Matt Turner, making him the club’s 10th-highest league goalscorer of all time, and netting Bournemouth’s 300th Premier League goal.
The 26-year-old then completed the turnaround as he poked the ball in from close range.
Forest refused to throw in the towel and showed brilliant character to level things through Wood, who rose highest to head in from a corner. Morgan Gibbs-White then went close to putting the visitors ahead as his shot which was curling towards the far post was brilliantly cleared away by Dango Ouattara.
But back came Bournemouth, and David Brooks struck a post before Solanke struck decisively at the death with another superb header, directing his effort into the top-right corner.
Another win for Iraola’s side moves them up to 11th in the table with 22 points, level with 10th-placed Chelsea. Forest remain 17th on 14 points, now only two points above 18th-placed Luton Town, who have a match in hand.

Both teams come into this game dealing with awful injury crises, which have contributed to testing runs in recent weeks. That is especially true of Spurs, who are winless in five – this, remarkably, despite scoring first in each of those matches.
Team_15 have dealt a little better with their selection issues, even with a packed schedule, but a late 3-0 defeat at Team_9 on Thursday bore resemblance to a previous loss at Team_3 last month when fatigue looked to have got the better of Eddie Howe's men.
With injuries at the forefront of both coaches' minds, let's get the team news...
Team_18 (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Ben Davies, Destiny Udogie; Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr; Dejan Kulusevski, Brennan Johnson, Richarlison; Son Heung-min.
Team_18 SUBS: Fraser Forster, Oliver Skipp, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Bryan Gil, Emerson Royal, Giovani Lo Celso, Alejo Veliz, Jamie Donley, Alfie Dorrington.
Team_15 (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Kieran Trippier, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schar, Valentino Livramento; Lewis Miley, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton; Miguel Almiron, Alexander Isak, Anthony Gordon.
Team_15 SUBS: Loris Karius, Mark Gillespie, Paul Dummett, Callum Wilson, Matt Ritchie, Emil Krafth, Lewis Hall, Sean Longstaff, Alex Murphy.
There is good news for Spurs as captain Son is fit to start despite sustaining a knock against Team_19. He is joined in the line-up by Sarr and Richarlison, making their first starts since returning from their respective injuries. Hojbjerg and Lo Celso make way.
Team_15 injury woes also show some signs of easing, even if they name an unchanged XI, keeping the same 10 outfielders for a fifth straight match in all competitions. Lascelles has recovered from a dead leg to lead the team, while Wilson and Longstaff are on the bench, where Howe has been so short of options.
Isak kicks off for Team_15, and the game is under way.
Team_15 begin this game in seventh but will displace fifth-placed Team_18 with a win. Spurs are looking to close the six-point gap to the top four.
Spurs have had no trouble starting fast, and they are straight on the attack. It looks as though Richarlison will line up through the middle, with Son playing from the left. There is certainly flexibility within that front four.
Guimaraes blocks from Richarlison! A smart pass from Son finds Udogie, whose flick in turn tees up Richarlison on the edge of the box. Brazil team-mate Guimaraes intervenes, though, and Richarlison cannot bundle through the Team_15 defence when the ball comes back to him.
Richarlison denied again! Son is making a really bright start on the left and his flick sends Kulusevski away to feed Richarlison. The angle is narrowing, however, and Schar deflects the shot over.
There is a scramble in the box from Team_18 corner, but no home player can get hold of the ball in order to take a shot. They are still well on top.
So close! A first Team_15 attack almost brings a first Team_15 goal. Gordon and Joelinton link up on the left, with the latter teeing up Guimaraes from 20 yards. He is able to run onto the ball but slices his shot, sending it just past the top-right corner.
History suggests we should expect goals from this one. Of fixtures to be played 50 or more times in the Premier League, matches between Team_15 and Team_18 average the most goals at 3.16 per game. Their past seven meetings have averaged 4.43 goals!
WHAT A CHANCE! Isak has to score! Team_15 get in behind for the first time with Gordon, set away by Joelinton. He charges forward and crosses towards Isak, but Davies gets the slightest touch, meaning Isak's finish from in front of a gaping goal skips away off the outside of his boot. Agonising.
Both teams are finding joy down their respective left flanks. Son and Gordon look the two danger men at this early stage.
Schar has a problem. He takes his time looking for a pass just inside the Team_15 box and takes a whack from Kulusevski when he belatedly hacks the ball into touch. Schar stays down, indicating a knock to his back.
After a short stoppage, Schar is back up on his feet without requiring treatment. Team_15 can scarcely afford another injury.
Brilliant work from Almiron. Team_18 counter from a Team_15 free-kick, and Son has the opportunity to run at Schar, who still is not moving comfortably. Almiron races back to tackle the Spurs captain, and Son frustratedly catches him with an arm as he seeks to regain possession by the corner flag.
Johnson smartly gets away from Livramento, only for his cross to be nodded away by Trippier. Spurs attack again on the right, and Livramento is this time only close enough to deflect Porro's cross behind.
OFF THE LINE! Almiron intervenes to deny Romero another goal. The Spurs centre-back scored against Team_19 from a set-piece and is up highest again, nodding towards the bottom-right corner, yet Almiron is on hand to clear.
Team_15 have carried a threat on the break and should really be ahead, but the vast majority of the game is being played within 40 yards of Dubravka's goal. A teasing Son cross just evades Richarlison.
Even when Team_15 enjoy some possession, ""enjoy"" is perhaps the wrong word. They are struggling to get out, with Trippier visibly frustrated by the lack of options in midfield.
The pace of the two attacks is making this a great watch. Despite Team_15 difficulties on the ball, neither team want to sit back and defend, so there is plenty of space for the likes of Johnson and Gordon to run into.
Joelinton is the latest player to go down, remaining grounded as play accelerates from one end to the other. An Udogie pass comes to nothing, then Almiron is tracked down by Bissouma. Joelinton is soon back on his feet.
Romero leaves Almiron in a heap after Miley's lovely reverse pass allows the winger to advance into the Team_18 half. There is no action beyond a free-kick, from which Lascelles cannot control in the box.
GOOAAALLLL!!! Udogie scores and Team_18 strike first again! 1-0! The left-back first takes the ball outside the box in the middle of the pitch but moves it wide to Son and then keeps moving. His run is not tracked, and Udogie is there to convert from Son's low cross, with Dubravka beaten by the speed and accuracy of the delivery.
Son has been a threat from the outset, and he breezes past Trippier and sends in a brilliant cross.
Team_15 seek a response, with Almiron feeding Miley on the right. A low cross bounces straight through the box to Gordon, whose pass allows Joelinton to shoot from the edge of the box. His effort deflects over.
The Team_15 corner following Joelinton's cross comes to nothing as a foul is given against the midfielder, who is close to Vicario.
Wide from Sarr! Team_18 have players lining up in the middle, but Sarr is perhaps not the man they want to take the shot. Johnson delays his cross, and the recipient cannot get enough on his attempt, sending it past the left-hand post.
That speed in the Team_18 attack is such a problem for Team_15. Every time they look to get players forward, they are vulnerable on the counter. Son tries to take on Lascelles but instead runs the ball out of play.
BIG CHANCE! Almiron shoots too close to Vicario! To their credit, Team_15 keep trying to press and eventually get their reward when Spurs cede possession. Isak moves the ball on to Gordon, who feeds Almiron. The winger is through on goal but shoots early, and it is ultimately a simple save.
Offside flags frustrate the attackers at either end. Another rapid Team_18 move is halted when Richarlison and Son combine in the box, before Almiron is offside at the other end following a more patient move.
GOOAAALLLL!!! There is the vital second goal! Richarlison makes it 2-0 to Team_18! It is another goal that comes from the left, with Son wriggling past Trippier, who had let the winger in initially with a poor header. Son cuts the ball back to Richarlison, who sweeps past a stationary Dubravka.
The decision to play Son from the left, rather than through the middle, has certainly been rewarded so far. He is giving Trippier a torrid time and collects his second assist.
Trippier was at fault for all three Team_9 goals in Team_15 previous match, and he cannot get to grips with Son here, although he is not alone. Team_15 look so untidy at the back.
A whisker wide! Johnson blasts just past the post from 20 yards after Sarr bullies Joelinton off the ball. Dubravka is beaten but so is the post.
Kulusevski shoots straight at Dubravka! Team_15 are really on the ropes now. Schar takes a heavy touch and is robbed of possession, the ball bouncing kindly for Kulusevski in the box, but he does not quite get hold of the shot.
How have Team_18 not scored again?! Joelinton is on the move at one end but underhits his pass to Almiron, allowing Son to race away. There is no catching the Spurs captain, who slips in Kulusevski. A clipped cross takes a deflection but looks certain to find either a Team_18 shirt or the far corner. Richarlison cannot contort his body to make contact, however, and the ball drops wide.
Richarlison gets his head to the corner that follows his chance but aims straight at Dubravka.
There will be three additional minutes at the end of the half.
Trippier's pass towards Miley is cut out by Bissouma but runs behind for a corner. Trippier takes the set-piece, too, but it bounces off Lascelles and exits the box on the far side. Lascelles is at least able to block Son's clearance to slow Spurs.
HALF-TIME: Team_18 2-0 Team_15
The first big chance may have gone Team_15 way, when Isak could not convert, but it has been one-way traffic since then. Team_18 are 2-0 up after two very similar goals. Twice Son ran at Trippier, twice he made space for a cross, and twice he found a team-mate for a first-time finish. Udogie got the opener, but Spurs have had no trouble netting first. The vital goal will perhaps be the second, which Richarlison grabbed to give Team_18 a commanding half-time lead.
Team_18 will hope they turned a corner in that first half, while Team_15 have a mountain to climb. They have lost 55 of the previous 56 Premier League away games in which they have been two or more goals down at half-time, recovering to take a point only against Team_11 in 2016.
Richarlison gets the game restarted, with no changes for either side.
In an attempt to restore some energy to this Team_15 XI, Howe has made one alteration: swapping Isak and Gordon. It was a move he tried at Team_9, too, to limited success.
Team_15 enjoy a rare passage of possession, making Spurs work for once. Eventually, Trippier crosses but is challenged by Udogie, sending the ball behind for a corner.
Trippier's corner is comfortably cleared, but a delivery from Isak threatens to cause a little more trouble. Porro does well to clear.
A key theme of the first half remains. Team_15 lose the ball, and Spurs break. Johnson nods the ball down to Richarlison in the box, but Guimaraes just intervenes.
Gordon is now leading the line for Team_15, and he gets on the end of a pass from Guimaraes and wins a foul in a dangerous position on the right.
Trippier whips in a free-kick from the right, but Bissouma is up highest to clear. Team_18 cannot easily get out this time, though, and Team_15 keep up the pressure. A deep cross from Trippier eventually finds Gordon, who can only volley over from the tighest of angles.
Team_15 are getting in again and again now. The ball is worked to Trippier once more, but his end product is lacking. Davies cuts out a poor cross.
Guimaraes is really fortunate to prevent a Team_18 counter on two occasions. Trippier's corner is cleared, and when Team_15 seek to build again, Guimaraes slips and almost gives up possession, clattering into a challenge. He bounces back up and dives in again, making the slightest of touches to divert the ball away from a Spurs player.
Back come Spurs. A low cross from the right is cut out, but they build again, the ball eventually reaching Bissouma for a relatively tame shot that bobbles through to Dubravka.
The problem remains the same for Team_15. They have no option but to attack, and that means Spurs can counter. Schar gives the ball away, and Lascelles has to lunge in to stop a break. Team_18 take their throw-in quickly to get on the attack, only for Kulusevski's pass to go astray.
Team_15 are at least providing a threat, again working the ball to the right, where Miley can cross. The ball is nodded behind for a corner.
Lascelles goes into the book, with one of the most blatant yellow cards you are likely to see. A Team_15 corner leads to a Team_18 counter when Almiron loses possession. Lascelles drags back Son, determined not to let him get away, and is carded.
GOOAAALLLL!!! That should be it! Richarlison again! 3-0! Team_18 have been on the back foot at times at the start of this second half, but one long ball in behind finds Richarlison, who is between Lascelles and Dubravka and slides the ball beyond the stranded goalkeeper.
A searching pass from Porro plays Richarlison in. It is a great ball, even if Richarlison's poor first touch briefly threatens to let Team_15 off the hook.
OFF THE POST! Team_18 almost have a fourth through Johnson! This deserves a goal as Spurs pounce following Trippier's slack pass. Kulusevski races forward and slides Johnson in behind Livramento. Johnson shoots high past Dubravka, only to see the ball bounce back out off the post.
Team_18 are rampant! Moments after Johnson goes so close, a diagonal ball to Son gives him the chance to volley goalwards, missing the far corner from a tricky angle.
Team_15 make a double change with the game surely gone. Howe welcomes back Wilson from injury, replacing Isak.
Almiron is also withdrawn as Longstaff returns to the fold. A rejig sees Joelinton go to the left and Gordon to the right, with Wilson up front and Longstaff in midfield.
Team_18 are playing with so much confidence, although Porro is surely not going for the top corner as his cross causes Dubravka some concern, drifting onto the roof of the net.
Kulusevski is really enjoying himself in a central creative role, working room for a shot this time but finding only Dubravka's gloves from outside the area.
It is Son's turn to shoot, but he drags a low effort and allows Dubravka to save easily. This feels as though it could end up any scoreline now when Team_15 were previously looking to get back into the game.
Joelinton is the second Team_15 player to be booked after thundering into Porro in pursuit of Gordon's deep cross. It initially looks a little harsh, but a replay shows Joelinton clearly shoves his opponent as the ball comes their way.
Team_15 are keeping the ball, but they do not look remotely like threatening the Team_18 goal. This has been another tough outing for Howe's side.
With the result seemingly secure, Spurs are also able to rest key men. Sarr, who was making his first start in a month, bows out for Hojbjerg.
The second Team_18 change also involves a man who returned to the line-up for this game. Lo Celso is on for two-goal star Richarlison.
Another double change for Team_15 sees Livramento replaced by Hall at left-back.
Gordon makes way for Ritchie in what is surely the clearest sign Team_15 are turning their thoughts towards a big game against Milan in the Champions League.
Team_18 are playing with Team_15! Johnson skips past Hall, who then goes chasing the ball and ends up being easily beaten again. Porro nutmegs Miley and then drives in a low shot that Dubravka spills but is able to recover.
Joelinton takes aim from distance, but a deflection sends it well wide. It is an optimistic attempt at best, just about summing up Team_15 attacking efforts.
Joelinton has a far better chance from a Team_15 corner, but he heads wide! The midfielder-turned-winger is up highest, yet his header misses the far post by some distance.
Again Joelinton is involved as he wins a free-kick in a promising position, but a brilliant Trippier cross just creeps away from Schar.
Romero is booked for an awful challenge on Wilson, but he could be in trouble as there is a VAR check.
Both teams are perhaps ultimately relieved there is no action from the VAR as Romero lunges in on Wilson, who is already on the ground, and catches his ankle. Guimaraes then sticks his head in on Bissouma, but neither incident warrants a red card, according to the officials.
Team_15 eventually work a crossing opportunity from the free-kick that follows Romero's challenge, but Vicario gathers at the second attempt.
Trippier is the latest man to dive in, and he earns a booking for his challenge on Kulusevski. That card brings with it a suspension for the right-back.
PENALTY! Spurs have the chance for a fourth! Son gets in, Dubravka is slow to advance, and the goalkeeper brings the attacker down as he attempts to go around him. It is brilliant again from Son and poor again from Dubravka.
GOOAAALLLL!!! Son converts! The man felled for the penalty fires low past Dubravka's dive, making it 4-0 and capping a sublime day for Spurs and a miserable one for Team_15.
The fourth goal signals further changes as Bissouma is withdrawn for Gil.
Trippier will get a rest next week when he is suspended, and he departs early now, too, with Krafth on in his place.
Another Team_18 change sees Johnson make way for Skipp.
This looked like a damage limitation job for Team_15 even before that fourth goal, and now they are belatedly sitting deep and looking to prevent Spurs scoring a fifth.
Dubravka denies Skipp! The Team_18 midfielder is all alone in the area from a deep cross, but the goalkeeper races out this time, quick enough to close the angle and block the shot with his leg.
Team_18 are not done at four! Son wriggles between Schar and Lascelles to create an angle for a shot but slides his effort the wrong side of the post. So close.
Another Team_18 move gets them in on the right, with Porro played in by Gil. It is not clear if the right-back is shooting or crossing, though, as he finds neither the target nor a team-mate.
There will be a minimum of five minutes of added time.
Son receives a well deserved standing ovation as he is replaced by Donley for stoppage time.
GOAL! Joelinton nets a consolation! Team_15 pull it back to 4-1. Longstaff wins the ball in the final third, and Ritchie plays in Wilson, who unselfishly squares to Joelinton. A fine first-time finish at least gets Team_15 on the board.
Wilson looks as though he might be offside as he receives the ball, but the goal is cleared by the VAR following the forward's cute square pass.
Despite the scoreline, neither team seem particularly happy to play out time. Guimaraes feeds Wilson, who cannot quite work space for a shot inside the box.
Wilson heads straight at Vicario from Ritchie's cross! It is a great opportunity and one that might earn a little more attention if not for the state of the game.
FULL-TIME: Team_18 4-1 Team_15
Team_18 finally return to winning ways in some style. They were beaten home and away by Team_15 last season but outclassed them this time, scoring in the first half through Udogie and Richarlison after fine work from Son. Richarlison got another just when Team_15 were looking for a route back into the match in the second period, then Son got a deserved goal for himself from the penalty spot after he was fouled by Dubravka. Team_15 could have scored early but ultimately had to settle for Joelinton's consolation. As Spurs look forward to Friday's trip to Team_16, Team_15 must first lift themselves to play Milan in the Champions League. That is all from this game. Goodbye!"	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93480	Wolves	Nott'm Forest	2023-12-09	Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton	31543.0	Samuel Barrott	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Burnley and Sheffield United at Turf Moor.
Burnley lost their sixth consecutive Premier League game in their last outing to remain at the bottom of the table. The Clarets were on their way to their first home victory after Jay Rodriguez’s penalty put them ahead against West Ham. However, a late own goal from Dara O’Shea and a 91st-minute volley from Tomas Soucek gave David Moyes’ men the win. Vincent Kompany’s side have only collected four points this campaign, drawing with Nottingham Forest and beating Luton Town. Despite this, Burnley will be encouraged by their recent form against the Blades. They have won four of their last five games against them (drawing one) and will move above United with another triumph.
The Blades finished second in the Championship last season, nine points behind league winners Burnley. However, they have also struggled since gaining promotion to the Premier League. Paul Heckingbottom’s side lost nine of their first 10 games in the top flight, with their only point coming against Everton. United showed a slight upturn in form in November, beating Wolves at the start of the month before gaining an away point versus Brighton, but lost their most recent fixture. Marcus Tavernier netted twice either side of a goal from Justin Kluivert to help a resurgent Bournemouth side to a comfortable 3-1 win. They did prevail in their last meeting against Burnley in the Premier League, with David McGoldrick scoring the only goal in a 1-0 at Bramall Lane in May 2021.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Jacob Bruun Larsen, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Luca Koleosho; Jay Rodriguez, Zeki Amdouni.
BURNLEY SUBS: Johann Gudmundsson, Nathan Redmond, Hjalmar Ekdal, Aaron Ramsey, Lawrence Vigouroux, Mike Tresor, Han-Noah Massengo, Han-Noah Massengo, Wilson Odobert.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (3-4-2-1): Wes Foderingham; George Baldock, Jack Robinson, Auston Trusty; Anel Ahmedhodzic, Oliver Norwood, John Fleck, Luke Thomas; Oliver McBurnie, Gustavo Hamer; Cameron Archer.
SHEFFIELD UNITED SUBS: Adam Davies, Max Lowe, Benie Traore, Jayden Bogle, Jayden Bogle, Vinicius Souza, Anis Ben Slimane, Yasser Larouci, James McAtee, William Osula.
Burnley make one change to the side that lost to West Ham in their previous match. Larsen comes in and replaces Gudmundsson, who drops onto the bench.
The Blades make three alterations to the team that lost to Bournemouth in their last match. Ahmedhodzic comes in for Bogle on the right side of the midfield, with Fleck also appearing in the middle. Souza moves onto the bench as a result. McBurnie starts in the attack for the first time in four matches, meaning that McAtee misses out.
The away side has lost three of the four Premier League meetings between Burnley and the Blades, with the exception being a 1-1 draw at Turf Moor in July 2020. Both teams are now on the pitch and are ready to get the game started.
Burnley get this Premier League clash under way. Amdouni with the first kick.
GOALLLLLL! WHAT A START FOR BURNLEY! 1-0! What a header from Rodriguez. Amdouni shows some nice touches to flick the ball past a couple of United players before rolling a pass down the left to Taylor. The left-back finds Rodriguez, who dives across the box to get on the end of the cross to head in.
Taylor is in space down the left and curls in a perfect first-time cross. It is low, allowing Rodriguez to get ahead of his marker to score. The goal came after just 15 seconds.
Rodriguez is the first player in Premier League history to score in the opening 15 seconds of two separate Premier League matches, with his other coming 10 years and one day ago for Southampton against Chelsea.
Sheffield United have lost 25 of their last 30 Premier League away games (winning two and drawing three), with their 1-0 victory at Everton in May 2021 their only clean sheet on the road in this run.
Amdouni has started the game well. He looks to beat Ahmedhodzic down the left, but the Blades man gets across him to shield the ball out for a goal-kick.
The Blades come forward for the first time down the right side of the pitch, with Ahmedhodzic chasing onto the end of a chipped pass. He looks to go past Koleosho, but he defends well and Burnley have possession back.
Bruun Larsen rushes down the right and looks to cut inside to try and get a shot away. The ball gets caught under his feet, but he does well to flick a pass through to Vitinho, who wins a corner. However, it comes to nothing.
Amdouni takes down a long pass from Trafford brilliantly and holds onto the ball on the right side of United's box. He then pulls a pass back to Rodriguez, who leans back and sends a first-time strike well over.
Vitinho and Fleck chase after a loose ball in the midfield, with the Burnley man going in late and stepping on his foot. He is lucky to get away without a card to his name. There is a short VAR check for a red card, but there was not enough force in the challenge.
Hamer has United's first shot of the game, but it comes from distance, with the ball going well wide of the target.
Hamer makes the most of a loose pass in the midfield, playing a quick one-two with Archer to get away from Burnley's press. He then looks to switch the play from left to right, but Taylor makes a simple interception.
Vitinho has kept looking to overlap Larsen down the wing in this game. This time he rushes towards the byline to get onto the end of a pass from the winger and cuts a low cross back into the box, but Rodriguez is unable to flick his shot towards the goal.
CHANCE! The Blades are loading the box for a throw-in on the left. Robinson launches the ball into the box. It is headed out as far as Norwood, who lashes a low first-time shot towards the bottom corner. Trafford is equal to it, with the goalkeeper getting down to his right to push it away.
Vitinho has the ball and uses his quick feet to flick the ball away from Hamer, who swipes his legs away with a poor tackle. Referee Chris Kavanagh decides to keep the yellow card in his pocket for the second time.
The Blades could have a problem, with Baldock on the floor. He is being checked by the medical staff, who are inspecting his right leg.
Baldock was on the ground for a couple of minutes and cannot continue. Bogle started the last match and will now take his place.
Hamer is over a deep free-kick on the right, with the Blades getting men into the box. Fleck then comes over to take it and pokes it across to Norwood, who chips it into the middle. However, nothing comes from the attack and Burnley clear the ball away.
GOALLL! BRUUN LARSEN SCORES! 2-0 BURNLEY! The hosts are in control of this match. O'Shea has the ball inside Burnley's half and he chips the ball over the top of the Blades' defence. Bruun Larsen comes inside from the wing and controls it brilliantly. He then races into the box and rolls his effort into the bottom corner.
Burnley are known for their neat possession style, built from short passing. O'Shea breaks this with a smart pass down the right, spotting the run of Brunn Larsen, who beats the offside trap and finishes with composure.
OVER! Trusty has possession on the byline down the left and finds a way to roll the ball past a Burnley defender. He cuts it back to Fleck, who finds Archer, but he lofts his first-time effort from inside the box well over the bar.
United have never lost a Premier League game against sides starting the day bottom of the table (winning seven and drawing four). This is their first such game since a 1-1 draw with Fulham in October 2020.
Fleck is the first player to go into the book. He shows his frustration with a late tackle on Brownhill just outside Burnley's box.
Burnley are showing their confidence in the game and are keeping possession well. Rodriguez switches it over to Taylor, who finds Koleosho on the inside. He uses his body to roll past a Blades player before finding Norwood. The captain then rolls a pass into Berge, but he sends the ball out for a throw-in.
Another United player goes into the book. McBurnie throws an elbow into the face of O'Shea and goes into the book.
O'Shea is now booked for a foul on McBurnie. The Blades forward clears the ball away, with O'Shea coming in late with his right leg.
Vitinho escapes his marker down the right and looks to roll the ball into Amdouni. Trusty hacks it away before blocking Brownhill's first-time shot out for a corner.
Bruun Larsen's corner comes in from the right, with O'Shea flicking the ball onto Amdouni. He goes down after a pull from Thomas, but nothing is given. There is a short VAR check for a possible penalty, but the game is allowed to continue.
The Blades need to be careful, with a third player going into the book before the break. This time, Thomas stops a counter by pulling back Bruun Larsen and is shown a yellow card.
There will be five minutes of additional time.
RED CARD! The Blades are two goals behind and are now down to 10 men. McBurnie crashes his arm into the face of O'Shea when jumping to win the ball in the air, with the referee giving a foul and a second yellow card for the striker.
Burnley are ending the half positively. Vitinho chips a pass down the right, forcing Rodriguez to come wide to retrieve possession. He does well and wins a corner.
Bruun Larsen's corner is flicked across the box by the head of O'Shea, but nobody in a Burnley shirt can get a shot away. Berge had run too far forward and couldn't hook the ball back towards the goal.
Taylor's inviting cross from the right looks for Rodriguez, but Trusty gets above the striker to get there first. Fleck then heads it behind for a corner. However, the Clarets don't have enough time to make anything of it.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 2-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Goals from Rodriguez and Bruun Larsen have put Burnley in complete control against the Blades, who went down to 10 men late in the half. The Clarets started the game quickly and scored after just 15 seconds. Taylor found Rodriguez with a cross from the left, with the striker diving across to head the ball into the bottom corner. Norwood then tested Trafford with a powerful drive from range before the hosts doubled their lead. O'Shea's chipped pass over the top of United's defence found Bruun Larsen, who controlled the ball brilliantly before slotting his effort beyond Foderingham. Archer had an opportunity to get one back but lofted his strike over, with the Blades going down a man before the break. McBurnie was shown two yellow cards for separate elbows on O'Shea.
Burnley showed a clinical edge in the first half, scoring from both of their shots on target. They have only registered an xG (expected goals) of 0.59 but are fully deserving of their lead. Amdouni has had plenty of nice touches and played an important role in the Clarets' opener, with Bruun Larsen and Vitinho combining well down the right. As for the Blades, they failed to recover from the early setback. The away side only had three shots before the break, with Archer wasting a clear opportunity to score from inside the box. Heckingbottom's side have shown their frustrations, already seeing two yellow cards and one red in the match.
The Blades are making three changes before the restart to try and get back into this match. McAtee came on in their last win against Wolves and changed the game completely. He is given the same role this time, replacing Thomas.
There is also an adjustment in the attack, with Archer coming off. Traore is given the chance to make an impression.
Fleck went into the book before the break and is now coming off. Osula takes his place in the side.
There is also an adjustment in the attack, with Archer coming off. Traore is given the chance to make an impression. United only have one substitution left to make.
The Blades get the ball rolling again.
Koleosho shows some quick feet to poke the ball through the legs of his marker to move into space down left. He finds Taylor, whose low cross is cleared away by Trusty.
Burnley and the Blades are two of the four sides yet to keep a clean sheet in the Premier League this term (along with Brighton and Luton). They’re also the two sides with the most goals conceded so far this term (the Blades 34, Burnley 32). With United down to 10 men and struggling to find any rhythm in the attack, this is the perfect time for the Clarets to secure their first clean sheet.
Burnley have started this half well and are forcing the Blades to sit back and defend. Traore is the only player in the attack for the away side, with the forward looking isolated up front.
WIDE! Rodriguez holds onto the ball well and offloads it to Bruun Larsen on the edge of the box. He switches it over to the left towards Koleosho, who cuts inside before driving a low shot wide of the post.
Burnley’s Koleosho will be the player to watch in this half. Before today, he had more touches in the opposition box than any other player yet to score in the Premier League this season (48), while only Enzo Fernandez (22) has had more shots without scoring than the Italian (19). Kompany will be hoping that today will be the day that he nets his first goal for the Clarets.
Robinson's long throw-in from the left is poor, allowing Taylor to head it away before it could reach anyone in the middle of the box. If the Blades are to get back into the game, they must make the most of the set-piece situations where they can commit men forward.
OVER! Burnley are patient in possession and are waiting for an opening to score a third goal. Nobody puts pressure on O'Shea just inside the Blades' half, with the centre-back spotting the run of Koleosho on the left. He finds the Italian inside the box, but he sends his first-time shot well over the target. The flag then goes up for offside.
Burnley are in complete control of the match and are not letting the Blades get back into it. They have had 73.9 per cent of the possession since the restart and are forcing the away side to put them under pressure to win the ball. This has allowed Kompany's men to pass their way through them and move into dangerous positions.
BLOCK! Another chance for Burnley. Bruun Larsen has the ball on the right and waits for the final moment to poke a pass through to Vitinho. He cuts past one defender before having his shot from close range blocked by Robinson.
Osula leads with his elbow when jumping for the ball against Brownhill. He goes into the book as a result.
Bruun Larsen netted Burnley's second goal of the game and has been a constant threat down the right side of the pitch. He is now being replaced by the experienced Gudmundsson.
Beyer goes into the book for wasting time.
CHANCE! United have their first opportunity of the half. Hamer drives through the middle of Burnley's half before sliding a pass down the left to Osula. He gets a shot away from a tight angle, but Trafford comes off his line quickly to block it.
Osula has another chance moments after seeing his first shot saved, but the substitute heads wide of the target after escaping his marker.
Ahmedhodzic makes a late slide tackle on Amdouni just outside the box and is shown a yellow card.
Hamer goes into the book moments after the free-kick is given for dissent.
GOALLL! AMDOUNI SCORES! 3-0 BURNLEY! Taylor heads the ball into the air on the left, with Beyer getting on the end of it to knock it inside. Amdouni rushes towards the loose ball, driving through the middle of two defenders before sliding a low shot across the goal and into the bottom corner.
Beyer gets the assist with a smart header inside. He puts in into a good area, with Amdouni speeding past two defenders to get into the box before scoring.
GOALLL! KOLEOSHO SCORES! 4-0 BURNLEY! The hosts are full of confidence now. Amdouni receives the ball from Vitinho and rolls a pass across to Koleosho. The winger crashed the bar moments before but makes no mistake with this finish, shooting the ball into the bottom corner at the near post.
Amdouni thought about playing a one-two with Vitinho after getting the ball from the Brazilian but instead looked for Koleosho to his left. He moved the ball past a defender and finished smartly.
Burnley are four goals ahead and have decided to make some changes. There is a straight swap up front, with scorer Rodriguez coming off for Obafemi.
Koleosho's final impact on the game was his goal. Trésor is given the chance to make an impression in the final stage of the game.
Amdouni got a goal and an assist in a matter of minutes and is also coming off for a rest. Redmond takes his place in the attack.
Obafemi looks to make an impact immediately after coming on. He shifts the ball onto his left foot and curls his shot across the goal and wide of the post.
GOALLL! BROWNHILL SCORES! 5-0 BURNLEY! The captain gets a goal to his name. Tresor and Obafemi try to keep possession just inside the Blades' box, but Bogle gets his foot across to poke it away. However, the ball rolls out to Brownhill, who whips his powerful effort past Foderingham.
United have conceded 12 goals in the last 15 minutes of the second half, more than any other team in the Premier League this season.
O'Shea has been solid in the Burnley defence and got an assist to his name for a fantastic pass to Brunn Larsen earlier in the match. Ekdal comes on in his place.
Obafemi has been lively since coming on, with the former Southampton man wanting to get a goal to his name. He gets through the Blades' defence, but Robinson and Ahmedhodzic recover well to crowd him out.
Redmond's cross from the right is cleared by Trusty, but it is poor, with the ball hitting the arm of Robinson. There is a quick VAR check for a penalty, but nothing is given.
Vitinho has been brilliant on the right for Burnley and is somewhat unlucky not to have a goal or assist to his name. He surges down the wing and steps over the ball to cut inside past a Blades defender before whipping a shot around the post.
BAR! Burnley are searching for their sixth goal. Redmond gets on the end of a corner and flicks a header across the goal. Foderingham dives across to try and reach it, with the ball crashing off the bar.
There will be four minutes of additional time.
Burnley are keeping the ball well in and around the Blades' box. Vitinho and Brownhill combine down the right before possession goes out to Redmond on the edge of the box, but he is unable to get a shot away.
Brownhill is over a free-kick from range, but his strike is saved with ease by Foderingham.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 5-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Burnley thumped 10-man United 5-0 to secure their first home win in the Premier League this season. The Clarets started the game as they meant to go on, with Rodriguez heading in Taylor's cross from the left inside the first 15 seconds. Bruun Larsen touched down O'Shea's long pass forward before scoring double their lead, with Archer shooting over for the Blades soon after. McBurnie was then given two yellow cards for separate elbows on O'Shea just before the break. The hosts dominated from that point and netted three goals inside seven minutes. Amdouni rushed through two defenders and slotted in his shot to net Burnley's third before setting up Koleosho, who found the near post with his low strike. Captain Brownhill got in on the act and curled in the fifth and final goal. He arrived on the edge of the box and whipped his strike into the corner of the net. Redmond went close late on, but the substitute rattled the bar with his flicked header. Next up, Burnley will look to build on their win when they head to Wolves. As for the Blades, they host Liverpool. That's all for today, goodbye."	"Nottingham Forest stopped a four-match losing run to ease the pressure on manager Steve Cooper as they held Wolverhampton Wanderers to a  1-1 draw at Molineux.
Harry Toffolo opened the scoring for Forest but the in-form Matheus Cunha struck the Wolves equaliser, making it five straight Premier League matches he has been involved in a goal.
How the match unfolded 
Forest made a great start, opening the scoring in the 14th minute when Toffolo rose highest to head in Neco Williams’ floated cross at the back post.
But 18 minutes later Wolves equalised. Mario Lemina played in Pablo Sarabia down the right. He cut back the ball for Matheus Cunha, who sidefooted home. 
Forest nearly restored their lead through a Wolves mistake in the fifth minute of first-half stoppage time. Cheikhou Kouyate dispossessed Max Kilman and ran through on goal, but was unable to beat the onrushing Jose Sa, who had recovered from an injury to return in goal.
In the second half Forest picked up where they left off the opening period. Anthony Elanga’s shot rattled off the top of the bar but the forward had been flagged offside.
Forest continued to pile on the pressure. Williams delivered an excellent cross into the box that Toffolo somehow headed over from three yards.
Wolves threatened themselves and the recalled Matt Turner was called into action in the Forest goal. The American had to make a double save to deny Matheus Cunha from grabbing all three points for Wolves.
The draw sends Wolves up to 12th on 19 points. Forest remain 16th on 14 points, only five above the relegation zone.

Team_6 lost their sixth consecutive Premier League game in their last outing to remain at the bottom of the table. The Clarets were on their way to their first home victory after Jay Rodriguez’s penalty put them ahead against Team_19. However, a late own goal from Dara O’Shea and a 91st-minute volley from Tomas Soucek gave David Moyes’ men the win. Vincent Kompany’s side have only collected four points this campaign, drawing with Team_16 and beating Team_12. Despite this, Team_6 will be encouraged by their recent form against the Blades. They have won four of their last five games against them (drawing one) and will move above United with another triumph.
The Blades finished second in the Championship last season, nine points behind league winners Team_6. However, they have also struggled since gaining promotion to the Premier League. Paul Heckingbottom’s side lost nine of their first 10 games in the top flight, with their only point coming against Team_9. United showed a slight upturn in form in November, beating Team_20 at the start of the month before gaining an away point versus Team_5, but lost their most recent fixture. Marcus Tavernier netted twice either side of a goal from Justin Kluivert to help a resurgent Team_3 side to a comfortable 3-1 win. They did prevail in their last meeting against Team_6 in the Premier League, with David McGoldrick scoring the only goal in a 1-0 at Bramall Lane in May 2021.
Team_6 (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Jacob Bruun Larsen, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Luca Koleosho; Jay Rodriguez, Zeki Amdouni.
Team_6 SUBS: Johann Gudmundsson, Nathan Redmond, Hjalmar Ekdal, Aaron Ramsey, Lawrence Vigouroux, Mike Tresor, Han-Noah Massengo, Han-Noah Massengo, Wilson Odobert.
Team_17 (3-4-2-1): Wes Foderingham; George Baldock, Jack Robinson, Auston Trusty; Anel Ahmedhodzic, Oliver Norwood, John Fleck, Luke Thomas; Oliver McBurnie, Gustavo Hamer; Cameron Archer.
Team_17 SUBS: Adam Davies, Max Lowe, Benie Traore, Jayden Bogle, Jayden Bogle, Vinicius Souza, Anis Ben Slimane, Yasser Larouci, James McAtee, William Osula.
Team_6 make one change to the side that lost to Team_19 in their previous match. Larsen comes in and replaces Gudmundsson, who drops onto the bench.
The Blades make three alterations to the team that lost to Team_3 in their last match. Ahmedhodzic comes in for Bogle on the right side of the midfield, with Fleck also appearing in the middle. Souza moves onto the bench as a result. McBurnie starts in the attack for the first time in four matches, meaning that McAtee misses out.
The away side has lost three of the four Premier League meetings between Team_6 and the Blades, with the exception being a 1-1 draw at Turf Moor in July 2020. Both teams are now on the pitch and are ready to get the game started.
Team_6 get this Premier League clash under way. Amdouni with the first kick.
GOALLLLLL! WHAT A START FOR Team_6! 1-0! What a header from Rodriguez. Amdouni shows some nice touches to flick the ball past a couple of United players before rolling a pass down the left to Taylor. The left-back finds Rodriguez, who dives across the box to get on the end of the cross to head in.
Taylor is in space down the left and curls in a perfect first-time cross. It is low, allowing Rodriguez to get ahead of his marker to score. The goal came after just 15 seconds.
Rodriguez is the first player in Premier League history to score in the opening 15 seconds of two separate Premier League matches, with his other coming 10 years and one day ago for Southampton against Team_7.
Team_17 have lost 25 of their last 30 Premier League away games (winning two and drawing three), with their 1-0 victory at Team_9 in May 2021 their only clean sheet on the road in this run.
Amdouni has started the game well. He looks to beat Ahmedhodzic down the left, but the Blades man gets across him to shield the ball out for a goal-kick.
The Blades come forward for the first time down the right side of the pitch, with Ahmedhodzic chasing onto the end of a chipped pass. He looks to go past Koleosho, but he defends well and Team_6 have possession back.
Bruun Larsen rushes down the right and looks to cut inside to try and get a shot away. The ball gets caught under his feet, but he does well to flick a pass through to Vitinho, who wins a corner. However, it comes to nothing.
Amdouni takes down a long pass from Trafford brilliantly and holds onto the ball on the right side of United's box. He then pulls a pass back to Rodriguez, who leans back and sends a first-time strike well over.
Vitinho and Fleck chase after a loose ball in the midfield, with the Team_6 man going in late and stepping on his foot. He is lucky to get away without a card to his name. There is a short VAR check for a red card, but there was not enough force in the challenge.
Hamer has United's first shot of the game, but it comes from distance, with the ball going well wide of the target.
Hamer makes the most of a loose pass in the midfield, playing a quick one-two with Archer to get away from Team_6 press. He then looks to switch the play from left to right, but Taylor makes a simple interception.
Vitinho has kept looking to overlap Larsen down the wing in this game. This time he rushes towards the byline to get onto the end of a pass from the winger and cuts a low cross back into the box, but Rodriguez is unable to flick his shot towards the goal.
CHANCE! The Blades are loading the box for a throw-in on the left. Robinson launches the ball into the box. It is headed out as far as Norwood, who lashes a low first-time shot towards the bottom corner. Trafford is equal to it, with the goalkeeper getting down to his right to push it away.
Vitinho has the ball and uses his quick feet to flick the ball away from Hamer, who swipes his legs away with a poor tackle. Referee Chris Kavanagh decides to keep the yellow card in his pocket for the second time.
The Blades could have a problem, with Baldock on the floor. He is being checked by the medical staff, who are inspecting his right leg.
Baldock was on the ground for a couple of minutes and cannot continue. Bogle started the last match and will now take his place.
Hamer is over a deep free-kick on the right, with the Blades getting men into the box. Fleck then comes over to take it and pokes it across to Norwood, who chips it into the middle. However, nothing comes from the attack and Team_6 clear the ball away.
GOALLL! BRUUN LARSEN SCORES! 2-0 Team_6! The hosts are in control of this match. O'Shea has the ball inside Team_6 half and he chips the ball over the top of the Blades' defence. Bruun Larsen comes inside from the wing and controls it brilliantly. He then races into the box and rolls his effort into the bottom corner.
Team_6 are known for their neat possession style, built from short passing. O'Shea breaks this with a smart pass down the right, spotting the run of Brunn Larsen, who beats the offside trap and finishes with composure.
OVER! Trusty has possession on the byline down the left and finds a way to roll the ball past a Team_6 defender. He cuts it back to Fleck, who finds Archer, but he lofts his first-time effort from inside the box well over the bar.
United have never lost a Premier League game against sides starting the day bottom of the table (winning seven and drawing four). This is their first such game since a 1-1 draw with Team_10 in October 2020.
Fleck is the first player to go into the book. He shows his frustration with a late tackle on Brownhill just outside Team_6 box.
Team_6 are showing their confidence in the game and are keeping possession well. Rodriguez switches it over to Taylor, who finds Koleosho on the inside. He uses his body to roll past a Blades player before finding Norwood. The captain then rolls a pass into Berge, but he sends the ball out for a throw-in.
Another United player goes into the book. McBurnie throws an elbow into the face of O'Shea and goes into the book.
O'Shea is now booked for a foul on McBurnie. The Blades forward clears the ball away, with O'Shea coming in late with his right leg.
Vitinho escapes his marker down the right and looks to roll the ball into Amdouni. Trusty hacks it away before blocking Brownhill's first-time shot out for a corner.
Bruun Larsen's corner comes in from the right, with O'Shea flicking the ball onto Amdouni. He goes down after a pull from Thomas, but nothing is given. There is a short VAR check for a possible penalty, but the game is allowed to continue.
The Blades need to be careful, with a third player going into the book before the break. This time, Thomas stops a counter by pulling back Bruun Larsen and is shown a yellow card.
There will be five minutes of additional time.
RED CARD! The Blades are two goals behind and are now down to 10 men. McBurnie crashes his arm into the face of O'Shea when jumping to win the ball in the air, with the referee giving a foul and a second yellow card for the striker.
Team_6 are ending the half positively. Vitinho chips a pass down the right, forcing Rodriguez to come wide to retrieve possession. He does well and wins a corner.
Bruun Larsen's corner is flicked across the box by the head of O'Shea, but nobody in a Team_6 shirt can get a shot away. Berge had run too far forward and couldn't hook the ball back towards the goal.
Taylor's inviting cross from the right looks for Rodriguez, but Trusty gets above the striker to get there first. Fleck then heads it behind for a corner. However, the Clarets don't have enough time to make anything of it.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 2-0 Team_17
Goals from Rodriguez and Bruun Larsen have put Team_6 in complete control against the Blades, who went down to 10 men late in the half. The Clarets started the game quickly and scored after just 15 seconds. Taylor found Rodriguez with a cross from the left, with the striker diving across to head the ball into the bottom corner. Norwood then tested Trafford with a powerful drive from range before the hosts doubled their lead. O'Shea's chipped pass over the top of United's defence found Bruun Larsen, who controlled the ball brilliantly before slotting his effort beyond Foderingham. Archer had an opportunity to get one back but lofted his strike over, with the Blades going down a man before the break. McBurnie was shown two yellow cards for separate elbows on O'Shea.
Team_6 showed a clinical edge in the first half, scoring from both of their shots on target. They have only registered an xG (expected goals) of 0.59 but are fully deserving of their lead. Amdouni has had plenty of nice touches and played an important role in the Clarets' opener, with Bruun Larsen and Vitinho combining well down the right. As for the Blades, they failed to recover from the early setback. The away side only had three shots before the break, with Archer wasting a clear opportunity to score from inside the box. Heckingbottom's side have shown their frustrations, already seeing two yellow cards and one red in the match.
The Blades are making three changes before the restart to try and get back into this match. McAtee came on in their last win against Team_20 and changed the game completely. He is given the same role this time, replacing Thomas.
There is also an adjustment in the attack, with Archer coming off. Traore is given the chance to make an impression.
Fleck went into the book before the break and is now coming off. Osula takes his place in the side.
There is also an adjustment in the attack, with Archer coming off. Traore is given the chance to make an impression. United only have one substitution left to make.
The Blades get the ball rolling again.
Koleosho shows some quick feet to poke the ball through the legs of his marker to move into space down left. He finds Taylor, whose low cross is cleared away by Trusty.
Team_6 and the Blades are two of the four sides yet to keep a clean sheet in the Premier League this term (along with Team_5 and Luton). They’re also the two sides with the most goals conceded so far this term (the Blades 34, Team_6 32).

93521	Arsenal	Crystal Palace	2024-01-20	Emirates Stadium, London	60284.0	Paul Tierney	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League fixture, as Aston Villa face Burnley in both sides’ final matches of the 2023 calendar year.
Villa come into this clash of the clarets sat a lofty third in the table, but Unai Emery’s side have undergone a rocky patch of form over the Christmas period. Three straight wins and a six-game unbeaten run came to respective halts, with a last-gasp 1-1 draw with Sheffield United before a 3-2 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford last time out.
Second-bottom Burnley are still yet to show any of the form in which they waltzed out of the Championship last season and, already sitting five points behind 17th-placed Everton, risk being cut adrift in the relegation places. However, Vincent Kompany’s Clarets did win their last match on the road at Fulham and drew 1-1 at Brighton prior to that, so there’ll be hope that the Lancashire side can capitalise on Villa’s recent struggles.
ASTON VILLA (4-4-1-1): Emiliano Martinez; Ezri Konsa, Diego Carlos, Clement Lenglet, Alex Moreno; Leon Bailey, John McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Jacob Ramsey; Moussa Diaby; Ollie Watkins.
ASTON VILLA SUBS: Filip Marschall, Pau Torres, Calum Chambers, Nicolo Zaniolo, Jhon Duran, Leander Dendoncker, Tim Iroegbunam, Sam Proctor.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Wilson Odobert, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Johann Gudmundsson; Lyle Foster, Zeki Amdouni.
BURNLEY SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Jay Rodriguez, Connor Roberts, Nathan Redmond, Aaron Ramsey, Mike Tresor, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Hannes Delcroix, Michael Obafemi.
Unai Emery makes two changes from their 3-2 loss to Man Utd, with the injured Lucas Digne replaced at left-back by Alex Moreno. Moussa Diaby also returns to play in behind striker Ollie Watkins, displacing Leander Dendoncker in a midfield reshuffle despite the Belgian scoring Villa’s second in the first half at Old Trafford.
Veteran winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson comes into the midfield as Burnley’s sole change from their home loss to Liverpool on Boxing Day, replacing Mike Tresor on the left. Opposite flanker Wilson Odobert has netted in each of Burnley’s last two away games, and will be looking to provide plenty of support for Zeki Amdouni and Lyle Foster up front.
The teams head out onto the pitch at Villa Park, both looking to end their 2023 campaigns on a high note!
Diaby kicks the game off for the hosts, and we're up and running at Villa Park for the final time in 2023!
Forward come Villa at speed as Bailey dribbles down the right and into the box. His initial cross is blocked by Taylor, and a second attempt goes into the side-netting and behind for a corner.
Bailey's delivery is glanced away from the near post, but falls to Diaby on the other side of the box. He looks to volley goalwards, but gets his effort all wrong and blasts wide of the mark.
O'Shea's long ball down the right is chased hard by Foster as Martinez arrives on the scene, with the stranded Villa goalkeeper getting the vital touch that sends it out for a throw!
Following their 3-1 win at Turf Moor in August, Villa are looking to complete the league double over Burnley for the first time since all the way back in the 1925-26 season. They beat them 10-0 at Villa Park in that campaign!
Bailey cuts inside and hangs up a cross towards the far post with Moreno arriving late, but Gudmundsson's there to nod the ball clear and away from danger.
Villa manager Emery has won all four of his Premier League games against Burnley, with three of those matches finishing 3-1.
Odobert looks to advance into the final third for Burnley, with Foster and Amdouni making wide runs ahead of him, but he's dragged back and tripped by McGinn, winning his side a free-kick on halfway.
SAVED!!! A cross-field ball bounces awkwardly in front of the Burnley defence and is kept alive brilliantly by Moreno, who scoops it over O'Shea and into Watkins' path. The striker meets the pass with a well struck left-footed volley, but it's an easy one for Trafford to keep hold of as he makes the save!
Watkins drops deep to collect a pass as Villa try their best to break down Burnley's rigid defence, but neither he, Ramsey nor Luiz can make pick out that final ball and Burnley come away with possession.
Burnley defender Beyer has gone down in the box and will need to be replaced, with Belgian international Hannes Delcroix summoned from the bench to slot in at centre-back.
Villa win a corner to the right, but Bailey's whipped ball to the far post goes behind off Konsa. He's adamant it touched Brownhill last and says as much to the referee, but oversteps the mark and is shown a yellow card for dissent.
An ambitious back-pass from Gudmundsson is just inches away from being intercepted by Diaby, but Trafford's well out of his box to get there first and clear the danger.
Ramsey and Moreno drill successive crosses into Burnley's box from the left, but both are cleared by the visiting defence with Watkins ever the target man.
CHANCE!!! Douglas Luiz fizzes a Villa free-kick in from the left edge, with Carlos and Lenglet unable to get a touch on the goalbound ball before it's collected by Trafford!
After dealing easily with a Burnley corner, Villa fire the ball forward through Lenglet and Diaby brings it down on the edge of the box. He shrugs off Delcroix but not Taylor, who clatters into the French forward and concedes a free-kick right on the edge of the box which is more than worthy of a yellow card.
The Villa free-kick is eventually taken by Douglas Luiz, but his meek effort is hit straight into the wall, with Bailey's volley on the rebound meeting the same fate!
WIDE!!! Burnley go close! The visitors counter at pace through Foster, whose square ball from the right finds Odobert. He tees up Brownhill on the edge of the area, but the captain's low shot rolls agonisingly wide of the far post with Martinez all-but beaten!
SAVED!!! O'Shea's close-range effort is deflected into the path of Brownhill, who sizes up another shot from 18 yards and sends it straight into the gloves of Martinez!
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! Villa take the lead!!! Watkins chases down a wide pass and cuts inside before passing across the box. It rolls all the way through to Bailey, who sets himself before rifling into the top corner!! Trafford has no chance after a slight deflection off a team-mate in front of him and Villa lead 1-0 after a wave of Burnley pressure!
Watkins' incisive pass really shouldn't have made its way through to Bailey on the right, but the Jamaica forward made no mistake once he had that ball under control!
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!! An immediate response from the visitors!! Gudmundsson swings a free-kick in from the left which an unmarked O'Shea climbs highest to get his head to. It's a brilliant flick-on too, and Amdouni closes in at the far post to volley home from close range!!! From 0-0 to 1-1 in a matter of minutes, and we've got a game on our hands here!
That was some effort from O'Shea, climbing high above the hosts defence and pulling off a cushioned header that was easier for Amdouni to score than miss!
CHANCE!!! Konsa threads a delightful throughball in behind the defence which both Diaby and Watkins are after, but so is Trafford and the Burnley keeper races off his line to collect it.
That's O'Shea's third assist of the season – the joint-most of any Burnley player despite being a centre-back!
Amdouni darts down the left and crosses towards Odobert from the byline, but the winger can't dispatch the chance and his glancing header is well off-target.
Villa have now scored 17 first-half goals in their 20 games so far this season, with only Manchester City (19) and Tottenham Hotspur (18) netting more of all Premier League teams.
BALL IN THE NET!!! The offside flag denies Burnley the perfect turnaround!! Amdouni and Foster combine with a pass on halfway, setting the South African free to stroll into the final third and slot coolly past Martinez. He's immediately called offside though, and after a slight delay, the VAR confirms the decision.
Ramsey's powerful shot is blocked behind for a Villa corner by Brownhill, and after an unconvincing Trafford punch the loose ball is hooked away from the near post by Taylor.
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! The Villans are back in front!!! Another ball down the right from Konsa for Watkins, who cuts it back from the byline. Ramsey misses it at the front post, but Diaby doesn't, arriving in the centre of the box to slot into the far corner!!! There's a VAR check for offside against Watkins which takes some time, but it's eventually given and Villa lead 2-1 here!
A second assist for Watkins on his 28th birthday, and the link-up between himself, Bailey and Diaby has been something to behold thus far!
Burnley's Berge is shown a yellow card by the referee, coming back to book the midfielder for an earlier challenge on Ramsey.
The lengthy VAR delay was to check if Watkins was offside from Konsa's ball forward before the Villa striker assisted Diaby, but the England international was eventually cleared and we'll resume play with the hosts back in the lead at 2-1.
That's three assists for the birthday boy Watkins in six Premier League appearances against Burnley, who concede for a league-high 19th time in the first half this season.
Injuries, goals and VAR delays amount to SEVEN added minutes of first-half stoppage time – will the goal rush continue right up to the whistle?
Diaby's far-post cross is brought down by Moreno, but it's via the left-back's hand and he's penalised by the referee.
SAVED!!! Vitinho slots a pass into Foster's path and the striker lets fly with a low shot towards the far corner, which Martinez gets down to and holds at the second time of asking!
McGinn turns away from two and looks to thread a pass in behind for Watkins, but it's overhit and bounces into Trafford's grasp.
Douglas Luiz barges into Berge as the pair contest a high ball, giving Burnley a free-kick in a challenge you'd argue the Brazilian is lucky to avoid a card for.
Foster takes on his opposite number Lenglet as he races down the left, going inside, then outside before winning Burnley a late corner.
HALF-TIME: ASTON VILLA 2-1 BURNLEY.
The hosts lead 2-1 as a fantastic first 45 minutes draw to a close, with Villa kick-starting a wild end to the half! A somewhat ropey and chance-sparse first 25 minutes were soon forgotten when Bailey hammered home a Watkins pass on 28 minutes. Barely 100 seconds later, the visitors drew level, winning a free-kick straight after the restart which O'Shea flicked on for Amdouni to volley in. The offside flag denied Foster's finish to put Burnley 2-1 up, and soon afterwards, Villa would find their second goal, Watkins again involved to tee up Diaby for a cool finish. We've seen three goals already and plenty of other chances for both sides, suggesting that the second half of this game could get even better.
Watkins has been Villa's main attacking outlet on his 28th birthday, and has done a flawless job so far. He's had one shot well saved by Trafford from four touches in the box, as well as completing five final-third passes. Two of those passes had laid on the goals for Bailey and Diaby respectively, with Watkins also proving difficult to dispossess. He's won three of his five duels so far, including two in the air, and will no doubt continue to stretch Burnley's defence as the hosts look to extend their advantage.
Burnley's equalising goalscorer Amdouni gets us back underway at Villa Park, with the visitors keen for a fast start after going behind twice in the first period.
Foster chases another O'Shea ball forward from deep and gets the run on Diego Carlos, but Martinez sprints out of his box to head the bouncing ball away from danger.
CHANCE!!! Foster races in behind the defence to get on the end of Berge's incisive throughball, but after cutting back onto his right foot, the striker hits the deck under minimal pressure from Lenglet and sees his protests waved away by the referee!
SAVED!!! Brownhill's scooped pass is chested down by Amdouni in the box, with the striker letting fly and sending a dipping effort into the gloves of Martinez!
Watkins goes down in the box after contact from Vitinho, but he too isn't convincing the referee and play-on is signalled by the official.
Burnley have been behind at half-time on 11 occasions so far this season and have gone on to lose all 11 of those matches.
Brownhill plays a smart pass wide for Vitinho to cross into the box, but Lenglet slides in to get there ahead of Amdouni and a Villa free-kick alleviates the threat.
CHANCE!!! Konsa and Diaby combine down the right as the forward drills a low cross into the middle, but Trafford gets down well to hold the ball before anyone in claret and blue can turn it goalwards!
Villa are winless in nine when hosting their final league game of a calendar year, losing five such encounters and last winning against Fulham in 2003.
HE'S OFF!!! Burnley's task just got a lot more difficult!!! Berge allows Douglas Luiz to get goal-side of him after collecting a throw-in from Taylor, and drags the Brazilian back by his shirt. There's not much contact, but certainly enough to impede the Villa midfielder, and the Norwegian is swiftly met with a second yellow card that leaves Burnley a man down for the rest of this game!
Aston Villa’s 15-game winning home run came to an end against Sheffield United last time out, but they’ve still won 16 games and earned 50 points at Villa Park in 2023. That's their most at home in a single calendar year in league competition since 1983 (18 wins, 57 points).
Burnley, needing to bolster their midfield following Berge's red card, make their second enforced change of the match as Amdouni is withdrawn for Aaron Ramsey. His elder brother Jacob is in the starting side for Villa!
CHANCE!!! Foster and Diego Carlos compete for a long ball down the right channel, with the Burnley striker eventually winning the race and stabbing the ball just wide of the target!!! He's appealing for a handball against the Brazilian though, and replays suggest he's well within his rights to do so! However, no punishment follows for the Villa centre-back.
Diego Carlos could well be a lucky, lucky man to have avoided further scrutiny for that apparent handball, but it's his centre-back partner Lenglet who does leave the field, replaced in Villa's back four by Pau Torres.
SAVED!!! Moreno does well to keep the ball alive on the byline and finds Jacob Ramsey ahead of him. His cut-back is met on the edge of the box by McGinn, whose first-time shot is well saved by the unsighted Trafford!
SAVED AGAIN!!! Burnley can't clear the ball far enough and Bailey clips it back into the box for Diaby to run onto. The Frenchman cuts inside and side-foots towards the far corner, but Trafford is there to make another last-ditch parry before Douglas Luiz curls the rebound wide!
OVER!!! Konsa escapes the defence and latches onto Bailey's throughball, cutting it back for Jacob Ramsey who arrives early and blazes over the top!
Neither McGinn nor Watkins can make anything out of a bouncing ball in Burnley's box, but Jacob Ramsey's on hand to pick up the scraps and win the hosts another corner.
Jacob Ramsey's cross from the byline is helped on by Watkins into the path of Diaby, who takes a touch to set himself before firing high and wide of the near post!
OVER!!! How has he missed from there?? Watkins collects a square ball from Jacob Ramsey but slips over before he can turn and shoot. He still manages to get it away for Diaby, but again the first-half goalscorer can only blaze over from close range!
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! The 10 men of Burnley have equalised!!! Trafford's goal-kick is nodded on by Gudmundsson, and Foster speeds onto the loose ball, getting away from the Villa defence and finishing expertly with a low shot in at the near post!! Vila go close at one end, and Burnley make them pay at the other, locking us up at 2-2 with 20 minutes left on the clock!
Gudmunds­son's header on for Foster didn't look like it would carve out a chance, but the pace and positioning of the South Africa striker created something from nothing to level the scores!
As with his disallowed goal in the first half, VAR did want a look at Foster's starting position from that flick-on, but he made no mistake this time and it will stand!
Odobert's been unable to make it three goals in three straight away games for Burnley, but having seen his side equalise despite being down to 10 men, Vincent Kompany wisely brings on fresh legs in the form of Mike Tresor.
Gudmunds­son's header to set up Foster will be his last contribution of the game, as Connor Roberts replaces him out wide with just over 15 minutes to go here.
Denied a goal in the first half, Foster does get Burnley's second of the match eventually, netting his fourth of the season – the most of any player in the EFL Championship winners' squad.
OVER!!! Moreno takes on his marker and crosses for Watkins in the middle, but the Villa striker can't keep his header down and sends the ball looping over the bar!
BLOCKED!!! A free-kick on the left is taken short by Villa and Diaby pulls the ball back to McGinn on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort doesn't make its way through the crowded box and is deflected away!
SAVED!!! Jacob Ramsey finds Douglas Luiz in support and the Brazilian tries his luck from range, but his 25-yard shot is an easy one for Trafford to save and hold at his near post!
Diaby's been somewhat profligate in front of goal in this second half, and comes off now for Jhon Duran to potentially provide a late impact for the Villans.
The captains come together as McGinn catches a stray elbow from Brownhill while competing for a high ball. Play is halted for the Scot to receive treatment, but he's soon back to his feet.
PENALTY!!! This could be huge for Aston Villa!!! Bailey burns Taylor around the outside and looks for Duran in the box. The cut-back is intercepted by Aaron Ramsey, but he clips the Colombian when looking to launch a clearance and the referee points to the spot!! An instant impact from the substitute, but it's a nightmare for young Ramsey against his former club!
There's some pushing and shoving in the box between Roberts and Villa's Jacob Ramsey, and the latter is shown a yellow card as Douglas Luiz prepares to step up.
GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Douglas Luiz dispatches the penalty – just – taking a long run-up and seeing his effort bounce off the underside of the bar twice before nestling in the corner!!! Trafford guessed the right way but could do nothing about that, and Villa go 3-2 up with injury time just seconds away!
That's Douglas Luiz's sixth goal of the season, fourth successful penalty in a row, and Villa's 11th goal in the last 15 minutes of their second halves this season. Only Liverpool (15) and Luton (13) have scored more often in this period.
We're into NINE added minutes at Villa Park – hold on to your hats, because there's little to suggest the carnage we've seen so far has any chance of slowing down!
Leander Dendoncker enters the fray late for the Villans, replacing Bailey with a mind to keeping hold of their slender 3-2 lead.
Tresor cuts inside and curls a cross in towards the far post, but no-one in yellow can get near the ball and behind it goes for a goal-kick.
Martinez takes his time (and a bit more too) to take the goal-kick, being met by a yellow card from the referee after he's finally released it!
McGinn leaves a late foot on Brownhill after the Burnley captain has given the ball away, warranting a late, needless yellow card for the Villa skipper.
Delcroix gets forward for Burnley and lines up a cross into the area, but it's deflected on the way and headed into touch by Torres!
The ball breaks kindly for Villa and Watkins races into open pasture on the counter-attack, but he's stopped in his tracks by Vitinho sliding across to scythe the ball away.
FULL-TIME: ASTON VILLA 3-2 BURNLEY.
100 minutes of frantic, fantastic football come to a close, with that last-ditch penalty from Douglas Luiz handing all three points to Aston Villa! Burnley's task went from difficult to near-impossible after Berge was shown a second yellow card just 11 minutes into the second period, leaving the visitors a man down for the remainder of the game. They certainly rallied though, with Foster splitting the defence to race into the box and slot home a fantastic equaliser against the run of play. Villa pressed hard for a third goal throughout the half, testing the 10 men of Burnley and their goalkeeper Trafford with efforts from McGinn, Diaby, Watkins and Luiz, and the latter was the beneficiary when Duran went down in the box, former Villa midfielder Aaron Ramsey the man penalised. Despite twice hitting the bar, Luiz found the back of the net from 12 yards, and that was enough to finally break Burnley's resistance and secure a 3-2 win. Villa's two-game winless run is halted as they end 2023 in second, level on points with Liverpool at the Premier League's summit, while Burnley remain second from bottom, five points from safety and in need of a positive start to 2024."	"Arsenal ended a three-match losing run in all competitions in style as they crushed Crystal Palace 5-0 at Emirates Stadium to go third in the table.
Centre-back Gabriel was the star of the show for Arsenal as he scored twice, both from set-pieces, to put the Gunners in control before Leandro Trossard and Gabriel Martinelli (twice) scored from counter-attacks in the second half to add to the pressure on Palace manager Roy Hodgson.
How the match unfolded
Mikel Arteta made three changes from the side who lost to Fulham on New Year’s Eve. Gabriel Jesus, Trossard and Oleksandr Zinchenko came back into the starting XI, while Hodgson made two changes for Palace, Will Hughes and Jeffrey Schlupp coming in for Jordan Ayew and Michael Olise.
Arsenal’s bright start was rewarded with a goal after 10 minutes, Gabriel rising highest to head home Declan Rice’s corner at the back post. It was Arsenal’s ninth Premier League goal from a corner this season, and 10th headed goal, both more than any other Premier League team. 
It was nearly 2-0 minutes later as another Arsenal set-piece ball rebounded off Jefferson Lerma and hit the bar.
Palace threatened in spurts. Lerma pounced on a poor clearance from David Raya and tested the Arsenal goalkeeper with a powerful long-range shot that the Spaniard tipped behind.
Arsenal doubled their lead in the 37th minute, with again Gabriel adding his second of the match. The defender got ahead of his marker Chris Richards once more to head Bukayo Saka’s far-post corner in off Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.
Arsenal got their third of the game just before the hour. Shortly after missing a chance to score, Trossard this time converted from a counter-attack that only took 10 seconds. 
Raya gathered a Palace cross and threw the ball out to Jesus down the right. The Arsenal striker ran with the ball before squaring to Trossard, who dropped Chris Richards before finishing past Henderson to celebrate the first anniversary of joining the club. It was also the Belgian’s first of eight goals for the club not assisted by Saka.
The game eased off as both sides made substitutions, with Rice one of the changes, limping off, which could be a worry for Arteta. 
Substitute Martinelli scored twice inside two stoppage-time minutes, both from counter-attacks, to round off a huge victory for the home side.
The win takes his team into third, level on points with Manchester City and Aston Villa either side of them with 43 and two points behind leaders Liverpool.
The defeat means that Palace are on a run of five points from their last 10 matches which leaves them 15th with 21 points, only five above the relegation zone.

Team_1	Team_8	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League fixture, as Team_2 face Team_6 in both sides’ final matches of the 2023 calendar year.
Villa come into this clash of the clarets sat a lofty third in the table, but Unai Emery’s side have undergone a rocky patch of form over the Christmas period. Three straight wins and a six-game unbeaten run came to respective halts, with a last-gasp 1-1 draw with Team_17 before a 3-2 loss to Team_14 at Old Trafford last time out.
Second-bottom Team_6 are still yet to show any of the form in which they waltzed out of the Championship last season and, already sitting five points behind 17th-placed Team_9, risk being cut adrift in the relegation places. However, Vincent Kompany’s Clarets did win their last match on the road at Team_10 and drew 1-1 at Team_5 prior to that, so there’ll be hope that the Lancashire side can capitalise on Villa’s recent struggles.
Team_2 (4-4-1-1): Emiliano Martinez; Ezri Konsa, Diego Carlos, Clement Lenglet, Alex Moreno; Leon Bailey, John McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Jacob Ramsey; Moussa Diaby; Ollie Watkins.
Team_2 SUBS: Filip Marschall, Pau Torres, Calum Chambers, Nicolo Zaniolo, Jhon Duran, Leander Dendoncker, Tim Iroegbunam, Sam Proctor.
Team_6 (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Wilson Odobert, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Johann Gudmundsson; Lyle Foster, Zeki Amdouni.
Team_6 SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Jay Rodriguez, Connor Roberts, Nathan Redmond, Aaron Ramsey, Mike Tresor, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Hannes Delcroix, Michael Obafemi.
Unai Emery makes two changes from their 3-2 loss to Man Utd, with the injured Lucas Digne replaced at left-back by Alex Moreno. Moussa Diaby also returns to play in behind striker Ollie Watkins, displacing Leander Dendoncker in a midfield reshuffle despite the Belgian scoring Villa’s second in the first half at Old Trafford.
Veteran winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson comes into the midfield as Team_6’s sole change from their home loss to Team_11 on Boxing Day, replacing Mike Tresor on the left. Opposite flanker Wilson Odobert has netted in each of Team_6’s last two away games, and will be looking to provide plenty of support for Zeki Amdouni and Lyle Foster up front.
The teams head out onto the pitch at Villa Park, both looking to end their 2023 campaigns on a high note!
Diaby kicks the game off for the hosts, and we're up and running at Villa Park for the final time in 2023!
Forward come Villa at speed as Bailey dribbles down the right and into the box. His initial cross is blocked by Taylor, and a second attempt goes into the side-netting and behind for a corner.
Bailey's delivery is glanced away from the near post, but falls to Diaby on the other side of the box. He looks to volley goalwards, but gets his effort all wrong and blasts wide of the mark.
O'Shea's long ball down the right is chased hard by Foster as Martinez arrives on the scene, with the stranded Villa goalkeeper getting the vital touch that sends it out for a throw!
Following their 3-1 win at Turf Moor in August, Villa are looking to complete the league double over Team_6 for the first time since all the way back in the 1925-26 season. They beat them 10-0 at Villa Park in that campaign!
Bailey cuts inside and hangs up a cross towards the far post with Moreno arriving late, but Gudmundsson's there to nod the ball clear and away from danger.
Villa manager Emery has won all four of his Premier League games against Team_6, with three of those matches finishing 3-1.
Odobert looks to advance into the final third for Team_6, with Foster and Amdouni making wide runs ahead of him, but he's dragged back and tripped by McGinn, winning his side a free-kick on halfway.
SAVED!!! A cross-field ball bounces awkwardly in front of the Team_6 defence and is kept alive brilliantly by Moreno, who scoops it over O'Shea and into Watkins' path.

A second assist for Watkins on his 28th birthday, and the link-up between himself, Bailey and Diaby has been something to behold thus far!
Team_6 Berge is shown a yellow card by the referee, coming back to book the midfielder for an earlier challenge on Ramsey.
The lengthy VAR delay was to check if Watkins was offside from Konsa's ball forward before the Villa striker assisted Diaby, but the England international was eventually cleared and we'll resume play with the hosts back in the lead at 2-1.
That's three assists for the birthday boy Watkins in six Premier League appearances against Team_6, who concede for a league-high 19th time in the first half this season.
Injuries, goals and VAR delays amount to SEVEN added minutes of first-half stoppage time – will the goal rush continue right up to the whistle?

Team_2’s 15-game winning home run came to an end against Team_17 last time out, but they’ve still won 16 games and earned 50 points at Villa Park in 2023. That's their most at home in a single calendar year in league competition since 1983 (18 wins, 57 points).
Team_6, needing to bolster their midfield following Berge's red card, make their second enforced change of the match as Amdouni is withdrawn for Aaron Ramsey. His elder brother Jacob is in the starting side for Villa!
CHANCE!!! Foster and Diego Carlos compete for a long ball down the right channel, with the Team_6 striker eventually winning the race and stabbing the ball just wide of the target!!! He's appealing for a handball against the Brazilian though, and replays suggest he's well within his rights to do so! However, no punishment follows for the Villa centre-back.
Diego Carlos could well be a lucky, lucky man to have avoided further scrutiny for that apparent handball, but it's his centre-back partner Lenglet who does leave the field, replaced in Villa's back four by Pau Torres.
SAVED!!! Moreno does well to keep the ball alive on the byline and finds Jacob Ramsey ahead of him. His cut-back is met on the edge of the box by McGinn, whose first-time shot is well saved by the unsighted Trafford!
SAVED AGAIN!!! Team_6 can't clear the ball far enough and Bailey clips it back into the box for Diaby to run onto. The Frenchman cuts inside and side-foots towards the far corner, but Trafford is there to make another last-ditch parry before Douglas Luiz curls the rebound wide!
OVER!!! Konsa escapes the defence and latches onto Bailey's throughball, cutting it back for Jacob Ramsey who arrives early and blazes over the top!
Neither McGinn nor Watkins can make anything out of a bouncing ball in Team_6 box, but Jacob Ramsey's on hand to pick up the scraps and win the hosts another corner.
Jacob Ramsey's cross from the byline is helped on by Watkins into the path of Diaby, who takes a touch to set himself before firing high and wide of the near post!
OVER!!! How has he missed from there?? Watkins collects a square ball from Jacob Ramsey but slips over before he can turn and shoot. He still manages to get it away for Diaby, but again the first-half goalscorer can only blaze over from close range!
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!! The 10 men of Team_6 have equalised!!! Trafford's goal-kick is nodded on by Gudmundsson, and Foster speeds onto the loose ball, getting away from the Villa defence and finishing expertly with a low shot in at the near post!! Vila go close at one end, and Team_6 make them pay at the other, locking us up at 2-2 with 20 minutes left on the clock!
Gudmunds­son's header on for Foster didn't look like it would carve out a chance, but the pace and positioning of the South Africa striker created something from nothing to level the scores!
As with his disallowed goal in the first half, VAR did want a look at Foster's starting position from that flick-on, but he made no mistake this time and it will stand!
Odobert's been unable to make it three goals in three straight away games for Team_6, but having seen his side equalise despite being down to 10 men, Vincent Kompany wisely brings on fresh legs in the form of Mike Tresor.
Gudmunds­son's header to set up Foster will be his last contribution of the game, as Connor Roberts replaces him out wide with just over 15 minutes to go here.
Denied a goal in the first half, Foster does get Team_6 second of the match eventually, netting his fourth of the season – the most of any player in the EFL Championship winners' squad.
OVER!!! Moreno takes on his marker and crosses for Watkins in the middle, but the Villa striker can't keep his header down and sends the ball looping over the bar!
BLOCKED!!! A free-kick on the left is taken short by Villa and Diaby pulls the ball back to McGinn on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort doesn't make its way through the crowded box and is deflected away!
SAVED!!! Jacob Ramsey finds Douglas Luiz in support and the Brazilian tries his luck from range, but his 25-yard shot is an easy one for Trafford to save and hold at his near post!
Diaby's been somewhat profligate in front of goal in this second half, and comes off now for Jhon Duran to potentially provide a late impact for the Villans.
The captains come together as McGinn catches a stray elbow from Brownhill while competing for a high ball. Play is halted for the Scot to receive treatment, but he's soon back to his feet.
PENALTY!!! This could be huge for Team_2!!! Bailey burns Taylor around the outside and looks for Duran in the box. The cut-back is intercepted by Aaron Ramsey, but he clips the Colombian when looking to launch a clearance and the referee points to the spot!! An instant impact from the substitute, but it's a nightmare for young Ramsey against his former club!
There's some pushing and shoving in the box between Roberts and Villa's Jacob Ramsey, and the latter is shown a yellow card as Douglas Luiz prepares to step up.
GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Douglas Luiz dispatches the penalty – just – taking a long run-up and seeing his effort bounce off the underside of the bar twice before nestling in the corner!!! Trafford guessed the right way but could do nothing about that, and Villa go 3-2 up with injury time just seconds away!
That's Douglas Luiz's sixth goal of the season, fourth successful penalty in a row, and Villa's 11th goal in the last 15 minutes of their second halves this season. Only Team_11 (15) and Luton (13) have scored more often in this period.
We're into NINE added minutes at Villa Park – hold on to your hats, because there's little to suggest the carnage we've seen so far has any chance of slowing down!
Leander Dendoncker enters the fray late for the Villans, replacing Bailey with a mind to keeping hold of their slender 3-2 lead.
Tresor cuts inside and curls a cross in towards the far post, but no-one in yellow can get near the ball and behind it goes for a goal-kick.
Martinez takes his time (and a bit more too) to take the goal-kick, being met by a yellow card from the referee after he's finally released it!
McGinn leaves a late foot on Brownhill after the Team_6 captain has given the ball away, warranting a late, needless yellow card for the Villa skipper.
Delcroix gets forward for Team_6 and lines up a cross into the area, but it's deflected on the way and headed into touch by Torres!
The ball breaks kindly for Villa and Watkins races into open pasture on the counter-attack, but he's stopped in his tracks by Vitinho sliding across to scythe the ball away.
FULL-TIME: Team_2 3-2 Team_6.
100 minutes of frantic, fantastic football come to a close, with that last-ditch penalty from Douglas Luiz handing all three points to Team_2! Team_6 task went from difficult to near-impossible after Berge was shown a second yellow card just 11 minutes into the second period, leaving the visitors a man down for the remainder of the game. They certainly rallied though, with Foster splitting the defence to race into the box and slot home a fantastic equaliser against the run of play. Villa pressed hard for a third goal throughout the half, testing the 10 men of Team_6 and their goalkeeper Trafford with efforts from McGinn, Diaby, Watkins and Luiz, and the latter was the beneficiary when Duran went down in the box, former Villa midfielder Aaron Ramsey the man penalised. Despite twice hitting the bar, Luiz found the back of the net from 12 yards, and that was enough to finally break Team_6 resistance and secure a 3-2 win. Villa's two-game winless run is halted as they end 2023 in second, level on points with Team_11 at the Premier League's summit, while Team_6 remain second from bottom, five points from safety and in need of a positive start to 2024."	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93409	Sheffield Utd	Man Utd	2023-10-21	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	31543.0	Michael Oliver	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of today's Premier League clash between Manchester United and Crystal Palace at Old Trafford!
Four days on from their EFL Cup meeting, Manchester United reconvene with Crystal Palace today, as they seek back-to-back Premier League victories. The Red Devils secured a 3-0 win over the London side in midweek, booking the cup holders' place in the fourth round, where they will again face last season's beaten finalists Newcastle United. After edging past Burnley last time out in the top flight, Erik ten Hag's team sit ninth in the Premier League table and six points behind the top four.
Although they sit just one place and one point behind today's hosts in the Premier League table, Crystal Palace have failed to win any of their last three games in all competitions: a 3-1 loss at Aston Villa and a goalless home draw home with Fulham was followed by the Eagles' EFL Cup exit on Tuesday. Before heading to Old Trafford today, Roy Hodgson's side had won just three of 14 away games since the turn of the year, and only one this season - at Sheffield United on the opening weekend.
MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Victor Lindelof, Raphael Varane, Sofyan Amrabat; Casemiro, Mason Mount; Facundo Pellistri, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Rasmus Hojlund.
SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Scott McTominay, Jonny Evans, Hannibal Mejbri, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho, Harry Maguire, Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Cheick Doucoure, Will Hughes; Jordan Ayew, Eberechi Eze, Jeffrey Schlupp; Jean-Philippe Mateta.
SUBS: Remi Matthews, Ademola Ola-Adebomi, Jairo Riedewald, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi, Rob Holding, Chris Richards, Nathaniel Clyne, David Ozoh, Malcolm Ebiowei.
Making four changes to the side that saw off Palace in their cup clash, Ten Hag most notably brings in young winger Pellistri for his first Premier League start. Lisandro Martinez and Sergio Reguilon miss out - alongside Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Luke Shaw and several others - as Man United's injury woes continue. Mount recovered from a hamstring problem to feature in midweek, though, and now starts his first league game for over a month, partnering Casemiro in central midfield.
A total of six changes sees Crystal Palace's team transformed from the side that started Tuesday's defeat. Former United goalkeeper Dean Henderson was forced off with a groin injury on his debut, so joins Odsonne Edouard, Michael Olise, Jefferson Lerman among those consigned to the sidelines. In Edouard's absence, Mateta continues to lead the line up front; Johnstone returns in goal, while playmaker Eze is recalled to the first XI.
The players are out on the pitch at Old Trafford, and kick-off is now just moments away!
The home side kick off, and we are under way in Manchester!
Patiently keeping possession inside their own half, Manchester United have most of the ball early on. Then, their first surge forward through Rashford is sharply shut down by Ward.
United are now aiming to build another strong run of results at Old Trafford, after seeing their 31-match unbeaten home run brought to an end by Brighton two weeks ago - they've made a relatively positive start to today's game at the 'Theatre of Dreams'.
Back in the starting lineup today, Johnstone plucks the ball out of the air following a delivery into the box by Dalot. Neither side has come near to creating a chance as yet.
It's still all United at the moment, as Amrabat shifts forward from his starting position at left-back to bolster the hosts' numbers in midfield.
After Ayew steals the ball from Amrabat in midfield, Casemiro lunges into a sliding challenge on the Palace forward and picks up an early booking. He must be careful for the rest of the game.
CLOSE AT BOTH ENDS! Following an inswinging cross from the left, Guehi flicks a header just wide of the right-hand post when unmarked in the area. Then, Hojlund lofts the ball over Johnstone at the other end after a counter-attack, but Mitchell gets back to hack it off the line!
Fleet footwork from Rashford on the left sees him step past two defenders, and it requires two more to block the England striker's path to goal and put the ball behind for a Man United corner. Nothing comes of it, though.
Manchester United have had 84 per cent of possession over the opening 15 minutes of this match, as Crystal Palace dig in and set up a barricade of white shirts between the home side and Johnstone's goal.
After Palace dwell on the ball in midfield, a half-chance opens up for Hojlund, but the young forward snatches at his opportunity and sends a 20-yard shot spiralling well over the crossbar.
There remains very little rhythm to this game, as United struggle to evade some well-organised closing down from their visitors; Palace are primarily concerned with absorbing pressure and - theoretically - striking on the counter.
A brief burst inside from the left by Rashford is quickly extinguished, and then Palace spring forward at speed. Mateta picks out Schlupp's run into space, but Dalot intervenes just in time.
Amrabat initially holds off Ayew near the touchline, but then the Morocco midfielder needlessly bundles his opponent over and concedes a free-kick around 30 yards from goal.
PALACE LEAD! Scoring a first-half goal for the first time this season, Crystal Palace go 1-0 up at Old Trafford! From Eze's free-kick, taken wide on the right, Andersen hooks a brilliant finish into the top-right corner! He hammers it past Onana from 10 yards and sends the away fans crazy!
CLOSE! A nod-down by Dalot from the right sends the ball straight into Casemiro's path just outside the area, and the Brazilian lets fly with a scorcher! However, it zips just wide of the left-hand post! It's livening up a little now!
Following an inswinging cross from the left by Rashford, both Andersen and the Eze have to head the ball away from immediate danger, as Palace defend their lead tigerishly.
An excellent recovery challenge by Varane denies Mateta a clean strike at goal from just inside the area; the striker had been played in by Eze's throughball and was poised to test Onana.
After a free-kick decision does not go Crystal Palace's way, Hughes sees yellow for showing dissent towards the referee.
Varane again intervenes to deny Crystal Palace, as Ayew's dangerous cross from the right byline is cleared away for a corner. Emboldened by their opening goal, the Eagles are growing in confidence.
Play comes to a temporary halt, with Rashford requiring treatment for an apparent ankle injury - he was just caught by Doucoure's studs.
The action resumes, as the recovered Rashford trots back into position and Manchester United continue their pursuit of an equaliser.
United have a chance to add to their meagre tally of one shot on target, as they earn a corner on the right-hand side. However, Casemiro's near-post run and header only sends the ball wide following an inswinging delivery from Fernandes.
Pellistri can't quite latch on to a clever low throughball by Fernandes, who is beginning to pull the strings as Palace legs tire a little and more space opens up just before half-time.
A trio of ineffective passes by Amrabat lead to Manchester United's latest move breaking down, and the home side seem to lack inspiration today; Palace are keeping them at bay quite comfortably.
Ayew positions his body well to win a free-kick deep inside his own half, relieving pressure on the Crystal Palace penalty area - can they retain their lead until half-time?
In the second of at least three minutes added on for stoppages, United continue their fruitless probing just outside Palace's defensive third; they may need a re-think during the interval.
An ill-timed challenge from behind on Rashford brings a booking for Crystal Palace skipper Ward.
HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 0-1 CRYSTAL PALACE
Stubborn, patient, and clinical when it counted, Crystal Palace lead by a goal at Old Trafford, where hosts Manchester United have yet to get out of third gear. A superb finish from Andersen separates the sides at half-time, during which Ten Hag must affect a change in his team's lacklustre performance. Palace's rigid defensive display bears all the hallmarks of classic Hodgson, and it is the veteran coach who will be far happier with things as they stand.
In addition to finally scoring a first-half goal today - their first in the Premier League this season - Crystal Palace have now stopped the opposition from scoring during the first half no less than six times in seven league games: no team has done so more often.
Crystal Palace kick off the second half, and we are back under way at Old Trafford!
After Dalot is unable to reach Amrabat's cross into the box, Palace threaten a quick counter, but Schlupp's throughball down the left is overhit and concedes possession.
Following Fernandes' corner-kick fron the right, Man United are gradually forced back, to groans from the frustrated home fans. Ten Hag's team may not be at their best - far from it - but Palace are defending with great commitment.
From almost the same spot on the pitch where he volleyed his team in front, Andersen now hacks away Fernandes' ball into the box from the left.
An optimistic effort by Casemiro sends the ball hurtling wide of the left-hand post from 15 yards, as the midfielder tries his luck with a bicycle-kick following Varane's pass.
SAVE! Hojlund and Pellistri combine on the edge of the box, to open up a rare sliver of space. Then, the ball is recycled and Fernandes strikes from an angle on the left, forcing a smart save from Johnstone!
SUPER STOP! Johnstone comes to the rescue again! This time, Hojlund's header from the centre of the box is saved by Palace's keeper! United skipper Fernandes was again involved, creating the chance with a cross.
Such has been their dominance of the ball today, Manchester United have attempted 478 passes in this match already - higher than their season average of 477.5 in the Premier League.
Having failed to make a major impact on his first Premier League start, Pellistri is withdrawn; fellow youngster Garnacho - who scored against Crystal Palace on Tuesday - replaces him.
SAVE! Mateta wins the ball off Lindelof deep inside Man United's area, and then lays the ball back into the path of Hughes. From the edge of the box, the latter drills a powerful strike straight at Onana, who repels it with both palms!
From a corner on the left, taken by Eze towards the near post, Schlupp sends his header looping narrowly over the crossbar and onto the top of the net.
Crystal Palace have seen their share of the ball slip even further since the half-time break, down to just over 20 per cent. Still, they stand firm and remain a threat on the break.
Already one goalkeeper down following Henderson's injury in midweek, the Palace coaching staff are concerned to see Johnstone go to ground clutching his head after a collision in the area. Fortunately, he is able to continue after a brief delay.
CLOSE! Having arrived into the box just on time, Mount misses the target from 10 yards out, flashing his header just over the crossbar following a precise pick-out by Dalot!
JUST WIDE! Palace escape a scare! Mount wins the ball back on the left, then Garnacho skids a low ball along the greasy turf and into the six-yard box. It takes two deflections before spinning inches wide of the far post! Varane then nods further wide following the subsequent corner.
Having drawn several defenders towards him with a direct run through the centre, Eze opts against releasing the ball towards Mateta and instead prods a tame shot wide of the left-hand post from inside the area. That was an excellent chance to all but seal it for the Eagles!
A reckless lunge from the side on Andersen results in Mount collecting a merited yellow card.
Having just been booked, Mount makes way for Martial, as Ten Hag makes a couple more changes.
Rashford follows Mount to the touchline, taken off early after a disappointing performance. Eriksen comes on to replace him.
Riedewald is sent on by Hodgson for the closing stages, as Schlupp is withdrawn.
For a tussle with Ayew on the byline, Amrabat becomes the latest player booked by the referee.
At the end of a prolonged United attack, Garnacho loses patience and cracks a shot at goal from more than 20 yards out but sees it charged down. Time is running out for the Red Devils if they are to avoid a second straight home defeat in the Premier League.
Martial carelessly gives the ball away on the left, as another Man United move falters. Then, Casemiro's cross is cleared away by Guehi.
Sending the ball harmlessly wide of the right-hand post, Casemiro's mishit shot leaves Johnstone a spectator. Surely the home side can come up with one more clear chance before limping to what would be a tame home loss?
Ten Hag makes an unorthodox double switch, taking off both central defenders: first, Varane is replaced by Maguire.
Perhaps a sign of Manchester United's desperation, Van de Beek makes a rare appearance, as Lindelof traipses off.
Palace also make a further substitution. Attacking talisman Eze makes way for a defender, Richards.
Tight to the right byline, Ayew drives a low cross-shot straight at Maguire, sending the ball behind for a Crystal Palace corner. It actually struck Maguire's arm, but there was nothing he could do about it - there's no real question of a penalty being awarded.
Guehi makes a last-gasp block on Garnacho's shot, using his chest to stop the ball. Palace are hanging on in there, but can they hold out until the final whistle?
In the fourth and final minute of second-half stoppage time, Maguire finds himself up on the left wing, but his pass to Garnacho is mishit; striking his team-mate and rolling out for a throw-in.
FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 0-1 CRYSTAL PALACE
Consigning Manchester United to consecutive Premier League losses at Old Trafford, Crystal Palace put in a performance of great discipline and resilience to move above their hosts in the table. While Palace celebrate a famous victory - thanks to Andersen's fine first-half strike - the Red Devils' are enduring an awful start to their 2023-24 campaign. They lacked any kind of rhythm or even belief today, and deservedly taste defeat for the fourth time in six games.
After being booed off by many of their fans today, Man United will tackle the third of four successive home games when Champions League opponents Galatasaray arrive in Manchester on Tuesday; meanwhile, Palace can reflect on their success for a while before meeting Nottingham Forest next weekend.
That's all from Old Trafford, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	"A superb goal from Diogo Dalot earned Manchester United back-to-back wins in the Premier League for the first time this season as they beat struggling Sheffield United 2-1 on an emotional night for the club after the death of Sir Bobby Charlton. 
Before kick-off, Man Utd captain Bruno Fernandes paid tribute to Sir Bobby by laying a wreath in the centre circle and the crowd broke into applause as a moment’s silence was started.
But it was Sheff Utd who started the stronger and almost scored in the third minute when Oli McBurnie was one-on-one with Andre Onana, but the striker shot straight at the goalkeeper.
Onana was called into action again in the 24th minute, making a diving save to his right to keep out a long-range effort from Cameron Archer.
Scott McTominay, Man Utd’s two-goal hero in their previous match at home to Brentford, broke the deadlock against the run of play five minutes later. He controlled a difficult pass from Fernandes with his chest before finding the bottom right corner with a scruffy finish.
But the Scot quickly went from hero to zero as he handled James McAtee’s cross only three minutes later to allow McBurnie to level the scores from the penalty spot.
Fernandes glanced the crossbar just two minutes before the break with a free-kick. Sheff Utd goalkeeper Wes Foderingham brilliantly denied Rasmus Hojlund a first Premier League goal two minutes into additional time at the end of the first half.
Rhian Brewster almost scored 40 seconds after coming on for the injured McBurnie but his swerving shot was stopped by the wrongfooted Onana. That was the last threat that Sheff Utd posed as Man Utd started to up the pressure.
Sofyan Amrabat came close to his first goal for Man Utd but saw his fierce 25-yard shot bounce off the bar.
The Red Devils finally found the winner in the 77th minute when Diogo Dalot’s brilliant curling strike from outside of the box found the top corner, despite a despairing hand from Foderingham.
The win lifts Man Utd to eight with 15 points, while Sheff Utd remain bottom with only one, a position after nine matches that no team have avoided relegation from.

Four days on from their EFL Cup meeting, Team_14 reconvene with Team_8 today, as they seek back-to-back Premier League victories.

From almost the same spot on the pitch where he volleyed his team in front, Andersen now hacks away Fernandes' ball into the box from the left.
An optimistic effort by Casemiro sends the ball hurtling wide of the left-hand post from 15 yards, as the midfielder tries his luck with a bicycle-kick following Varane's pass.
SAVE! Hojlund and Pellistri combine on the edge of the box, to open up a rare sliver of space. Then, the ball is recycled and Fernandes strikes from an angle on the left, forcing a smart save from Johnstone!
SUPER STOP! Johnstone comes to the rescue again! This time, Hojlund's header from the centre of the box is saved by Palace's keeper! United skipper Fernandes was again involved, creating the chance with a cross.
Such has been their dominance of the ball today, Team_14 have attempted 478 passes in this match already - higher than their season average of 477.5 in the Premier League.
Having failed to make a major impact on his first Premier League start, Pellistri is withdrawn; fellow youngster Garnacho - who scored against Team_8 on Tuesday - replaces him.
SAVE! Mateta wins the ball off Lindelof deep inside Man United's area, and then lays the ball back into the path of Hughes. From the edge of the box, the latter drills a powerful strike straight at Onana, who repels it with both palms!
From a corner on the left, taken by Eze towards the near post, Schlupp sends his header looping narrowly over the crossbar and onto the top of the net.
Team_8 have seen their share of the ball slip even further since the half-time break, down to just over 20 per cent. Still, they stand firm and remain a threat on the break.
Already one goalkeeper down following Henderson's injury in midweek, the Palace coaching staff are concerned to see Johnstone go to ground clutching his head after a collision in the area. Fortunately, he is able to continue after a brief delay.
CLOSE! Having arrived into the box just on time, Mount misses the target from 10 yards out, flashing his header just over the crossbar following a precise pick-out by Dalot!
JUST WIDE! Palace escape a scare! Mount wins the ball back on the left, then Garnacho skids a low ball along the greasy turf and into the six-yard box. It takes two deflections before spinning inches wide of the far post! Varane then nods further wide following the subsequent corner.
Having drawn several defenders towards him with a direct run through the centre, Eze opts against releasing the ball towards Mateta and instead prods a tame shot wide of the left-hand post from inside the area. That was an excellent chance to all but seal it for the Eagles!
A reckless lunge from the side on Andersen results in Mount collecting a merited yellow card.
Having just been booked, Mount makes way for Martial, as Ten Hag makes a couple more changes.
Rashford follows Mount to the touchline, taken off early after a disappointing performance. Eriksen comes on to replace him.
Riedewald is sent on by Hodgson for the closing stages, as Schlupp is withdrawn.
For a tussle with Ayew on the byline, Amrabat becomes the latest player booked by the referee.
At the end of a prolonged United attack, Garnacho loses patience and cracks a shot at goal from more than 20 yards out but sees it charged down. Time is running out for the Red Devils if they are to avoid a second straight home defeat in the Premier League.
Martial carelessly gives the ball away on the left, as another Man United move falters. Then, Casemiro's cross is cleared away by Guehi.
Sending the ball harmlessly wide of the right-hand post, Casemiro's mishit shot leaves Johnstone a spectator. Surely the home side can come up with one more clear chance before limping to what would be a tame home loss?
Ten Hag makes an unorthodox double switch, taking off both central defenders: first, Varane is replaced by Maguire.
Perhaps a sign of Team_14 desperation, Van de Beek makes a rare appearance, as Lindelof traipses off.
Palace also make a further substitution. Attacking talisman Eze makes way for a defender, Richards.
Tight to the right byline, Ayew drives a low cross-shot straight at Maguire, sending the ball behind for a Team_8 corner. It actually struck Maguire's arm, but there was nothing he could do about it - there's no real question of a penalty being awarded.
Guehi makes a last-gasp block on Garnacho's shot, using his chest to stop the ball. Palace are hanging on in there, but can they hold out until the final whistle?
In the fourth and final minute of second-half stoppage time, Maguire finds himself up on the left wing, but his pass to Garnacho is mishit; striking his team-mate and rolling out for a throw-in.
FULL-TIME: Team_14 0-1 Team_8
Consigning Team_14 to consecutive Premier League losses at Old Trafford, Team_8 put in a performance of great discipline and resilience to move above their hosts in the table. While Palace celebrate a famous victory - thanks to Andersen's fine first-half strike - the Red Devils' are enduring an awful start to their 2023-24 campaign. They lacked any kind of rhythm or even belief today, and deservedly taste defeat for the fourth time in six games.
After being booed off by many of their fans today, Man United will tackle the third of four successive home games when Champions League opponents Galatasaray arrive in Manchester on Tuesday; meanwhile, Palace can reflect on their success for a while before meeting Team_16 next weekend.
That's all from Old Trafford, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93485	Chelsea	Sheffield Utd	2023-12-16	Stamford Bridge, London	39599.0	Andy Madley	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of this midweek Premier League fixture as Wolves welcome Burnley to Molineux!
Wolves return to Molineux looking to respond to a pair of back-to-back defeats in London, having gone down to Fulham and Arsenal last week. While Gary O'Neil was frustrated by a series of controversial decisions in the first of those losses, he could have few complaints at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday as Wolves left themselves with a mountain to climb, and Matheus Cunha's outstanding strike was too little, too late in a 2-1 defeat. They will hope to get back to winning ways here, and this may be the first time they have been favourites for a home game this season, having hosted Brighton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Tottenham so far in 2023-24.
Burnley, meanwhile, breathed fresh life into their survival hopes on Saturday by routing fellow relegation candidates Sheffield United 5-0 at Turf Moor, ending a six-game losing run and hastening the end of Paul Heckingbottom's tenure with the Blades. Vincent Kompany's Clarets are now just two points adrift of Luton Town in 17th, and with the Hatters facing a difficult clash with Arsenal later on Tuesday, they will be looking to climb out of the relegation zone with a victory in the West Midlands!
WOLVES (3-4-3): Dan Bentley; Maximilian Kilman, Craig Dawson, Toti Gomes; Nelson Semedo, Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina, Hugo Bueno; Pablo Sarabia, Matheus Cunha, Hwang Hee-chan.
WOLVES SUBS: Matt Doherty, Santiago Bueno, Boubacar Traore, Fabio Silva, Sasa Kalajdzic, Tommy Doyle, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Tom King, Tawanda Chirewa.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O'Shea, Hjalmar Ekdal, Charlie Taylor; Jacob Bruun Larsen, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Luca Koleosho; Jay Rodriguez, Zeki Amdouni.
BURNLEY SUBS: Johann Gudmundsson, Nathan Redmond, Anass Zaroury, Aaron Ramsey, Ameen Al Dakhil, Mike Tresor, Hannes Delcroix, Wilson Odobert, Arijanet Muric.
O'Neil makes four changes to the Wolves side which started at Arsenal, with one of those enforced after Jose Sa failed to recover from a back issue he sustained in that game. Bentley replaces him in goal, while Bellegarde, Doyle and Traore are replaced by Sarabia, Gomes and Lemina after the latter duo served one-match bans on Saturday. Full-back Jonny Otto has been exiled following what O'Neil described as a ""training ground incident"", so young midfielder Chirewa keeps his place on the bench.
Kompany makes just one change to the Burnley lineup which began Saturday's thrashing of Sheffield United, with defender Jordan Beyer suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards. Ekdal comes in alongside former West Bromwich Albion defender O'Shea in the heart of their backline. The likes of Jack Cork, Josh Cullen and Lyle Foster are absent.
Wolves have both scored and conceded in each of their last 11 league games. They last had a longer such run between August and October 1985 in the third tier (12 games). Are we in for an entertaining contest here? The teams are out, and kick-off is rapidly approaching!
We're under way at Molineux for the first of the Premier League's full set of midweek fixtures! Hwang with the first kick for Wolves.
Wolves are looking to move the ball patiently in their 3-4-3 shape in the early moments. It's worked out to Semedo on the right-hand touchline, and he's fouled by Koleosho.
We have a booking inside 90 seconds here as Kilman charges out of the Wolves backline to carry the ball through the lines. Brownhill lunges in to bring him down, and the Burnley skipper is walking a tightrope already.
Lemina is potentially fortunate to avoid an early booking of his own after hauling Koleosho down on the Burnley left. Bruun Larsen delivers the resulting free-kick, but an old gold shirt is there to clear.
Wolves have scored at least once in each of their last 13 Premier League home games, their longest such run since a run of 14 between April 2019 and January 2020. However, they've also failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last seven in the league at Molineux.
Burnley are pressing high and forcing errors from Wolves early on, with Koleosho pressuring Kilman into a sliced clearance. However, the Clarets are forced back from the resulting throw-in and misplace a pass out of play on halfway.
Wolves are living a little dangerously as Bentley just manages to play a side-footed pass around Rodriguez under pressure inside his own area. Almost all of the game has been played in the hosts' half thus far. This is a big opportunity for Bentley, with first-choice goalkeeper Sa missing out with a minor back injury.
Wolves look to have a three-on-one on the counterattack for a brief moment, but Sarabia doesn't get his head up quickly enough to find Hwang or Semedo and eventually concedes possession. The Spaniard was the hero against Tottenham in Wolves' last home game with a goal and an assist in stoppage time, and he's started on the left of O'Neil's front three here.
Hugo Bueno breaks over halfway for Wolves, but he lacks support and is felled by a hard-but-fair challenge from Vitinho. Wolves are quickly back in possession, however, as they look to work their way into this game after a low-key opening.
Having won their first three Premier League meetings with Burnley between 2009 and 2018, Wolves are now winless in their last seven against them in the competition (three draws, four defeats).
Burnley right-back Vitinho appears to be hobbling after making that earlier challenge on Hugo Bueno. Wolves work the ball out to their left in a bid to test him, and O'Shea has to come over to head Sarabia's floated cross away.
It's been a very tame start to this game, with neither team managing a shot of any description as we approach the 15-minute mark. Both sides look to be feeling each other out at Molineux.
Good goalkeeping! Burnley stand off Kilman, who launches a throughball over the top of the Clarets' block, looking for Sarabia. O'Neil applauds the intention, but it just runs too long and Trafford comes off his line to claim it.
A big cheer goes up as Bruun Larsen takes a poor touch under pressure from Toti, flicking the ball directly out of play. It's all been very cautious thus far.
Berge skips into the area before offloading to Bruun Larsen, who lays it off for Brownhill on the edge of the box. He attempts the first shot of the game, and it deflects well wide for a corner. Bentley played Wolves into trouble again at the start of that move...
Burnley go for a corner-kick routine off the training ground, working it neatly into Brownhill, but his looping cross is beyond the navy shirts at the far post as Wolves get the goal-kick.
This is a decent spell for Burnley! Koleosho beats Semedo at the second time of asking before hammering a shot off from near the corner of the box, but an old gold shirt is there to block. The home fans are starting to grow frustrated.
Wolves have completely failed to get Hwang or Cunha into the game so far, as the Brazilian is crowded out in midfield. Hwang has scored five goals in his six Premier League home games for Wolves this season, with their 2-1 win against Tottenham last time out here the only time he's failed to score at Molineux in the league this term. The last player to net more home league goals for the club in a single campaign was Raul Jimenez in 2019-20 (eight).
Close! Burnley are controlling this game well, but Trafford almost makes a costly error as his slack pass is inches away from being intercepted by Hwang. The Clarets survive, though, and Koleosho goes up the other end to win a left-wing corner.
Amdouni nods the inswinging corner goalwards, and it crashes off a gold shirt before dropping to Taylor on the edge of the box. The left-back takes a wild swing and lifts his volley miles over the bar, but O'Neil is not happy, gesticulating for Wolves to up the tempo!
SAVE! Trafford is tested for the first time as Sarabia's strike loops up off Vitinho, and it looks like it might be dropping under the crossbar. The Burnley goalkeeper takes no chances, tipping it over for a corner.
There are groans around Molineux as, after a long build-up, Sarabia fails to beat the first Burnley defender from the left-wing corner. The hosts have yet to get going.
CLOSE! That's the best chance of the game so far! Semedo finally injects some pace into Wolves' game, charging past Taylor on the right-hand side before lifting a cross into the area. Sarabia arrives on it somewhat awkwardly and has to prod his shot with the outside of his left boot, and it's just too high to find the top-right corner!
There's a concerning moment for Burnley as Koleosho stays down, rubbing his lower leg after a tangle with Hugo Bueno. The young winger receives treatment and he seems able to rejoin the action – it looks like a contact injury which he can run off.
Wolves are enjoying a better spell now, moving the ball patiently. They need more of the pace Semedo showed in that last attack – he breezed past Taylor to create a good chance for Sarabia.
Comfortable save! Burnley record their first shot on target as Amdouni finds a pocket of space behind Wolves' double pivot, but his 25-yard effort lacks power and Bentley can simply fall on it.
Danger! Sarabia switches flanks, popping up on the Wolves right to thread a cute pass through for Semedo. He drives a cutback towards the six-yard box, looking for Cunha, but Ekdal does well to clear at his near post.
WAYWARD! Amdouni skips away from Lemina on the break before finding Bruun Larsen in an inside-right position. He skips inside Toti to shoot, but blasts his wild effort high and wide.
This is a major blow for Burnley. Koleosho is feeling his lower leg again and he won't be able to continue. Gudmunds­son replaces him on the Clarets' left.
Everything positive from a Wolves point of view has come down their right-hand side. Hwang is out there this time to get in behind Taylor before lifting a cross onto the six-yard line, but O'Shea nods it up into the air and into the gloves of Trafford.
HUGE DOUBLE SAVE FROM BENTLEY! Burnley are almost gifted the opener, but Bentley keeps them out! Gomes tries an ill-advised backheel under pressure on the byline, allowing Gudmundsson to recover possession and cross low for Rodriguez. His close-range finish is smothered by Bentley, who then dives to his right to tip Brownhill's follow-up wide of the post! Great goalkeeping!
The home fans are growing restless as we enter the final five minutes of this opening period. Wolves have been lacklustre and if not for their stand-in goalkeeper, they would be behind!
Gomes does brilliantly to ride a challenge from Brownhill before being hauled to the ground by Berge, relieving a spell of Burnley pressure. Wolves want a yellow card for the Clarets man, but none is forthcoming.
GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLL! HWANG PUTS WOLVES AHEAD! Burnley are architects of their own downfall in a huge way! O'Shea receives a pass out from Trafford, but his next ball into Berge is too heavy and the midfielder takes a loose touch. Sarabia pounces to flick it into Cunha, who plays it right to Hwang, and the South Korean sits his man down with a lovely stutter before stroking into the bottom-left corner. Wolves lead 1-0!
Cunha gets the assist, unselfishly picking out Hwang when he could have gone for goal himself. The South Korean did the rest brilliantly.
All of a sudden, there's a hunger about Wolves as they press Burnley with greater intensity. Kompany will be fuming with that goal. The Clarets had been in control, but they made their own problems again there!
We will have four minutes of stoppage time before the break, presumably owing to Koleosho's earlier injury.
Burnley look to finish the half with a flourish as their centre-backs are waved forward for a Vitinho long throw. Dawson slices an awful clearance up in the air, but O'Shea's attempt to cross is even worse, setting Semedo off on a counterattack on the far side.
Burnley get men behind the ball to slow that Wolves break, then Ekdal almost sells Taylor short with a pass inside his own half. The Clarets' attempts to play out are admirable, but they need to cut out those errors.
Almost! Cunha brings the ball out of the sky with a delicate touch to find Sarabia, who looks to send Lemina through on goal. The Wolves midfielder is matched stride for stride by O'Shea, though, and the Burnley defender makes a crucial block to deny Wolves a clear route to goal.
HALF-TIME: WOLVES 1-0 BURNLEY.
Jarred Gillett brings a slow burner of a first half to a close at Molineux, and Hwang's goal is the difference at the break as Wolves lead Burnley 1-0. O'Neil's team have looked far from assured, though, with Burnley recording more than twice as many shots as their hosts (eight to three). The Clarets' best chances came when Bentley made a stunning double save to deny Rodriguez and Brownhill after 38 minutes, and Kompany's men were behind just four minutes later when a poor pass out from the back allowed Cunha to tee up Hwang, who finished in lethal fashion for his eighth Premier League goal of the season. It's still all to play for in the second half, which is coming up shortly!
Despite the scoreline, O'Neil will be desperate for an improvement from Wolves after the break. They've been too pedestrian in their passing and caused their own problems with errors at the back, but they lead due to Burnley committing a mistake of their own at the other end! Kompany will believe Burnley can get back into this game, though the loss of Koleosho to injury represents a big blow.
Burnley get the second half under way at Molineux, with no changes made by either side at half-time. Burnley were, of course, forced to withdraw Koleosho earlier.
Burnley have already aimed two or three long balls towards the Wolves right-back area in the opening moments of the second half. It will be interesting to see if they adopt a more direct style after playing themselves into trouble for Hwang's goal.
Gudmundsson checks back to cross on his left foot, and Dawson's headed clearance only finds a navy shirt as Burnley look to pen Wolves back in the opening moments of the second period.
Only Erling Haaland (14), Mohamed Salah (10) and Son Heung-min (nine) have scored more Premier League goals than Hwang (eight) this season, while only Salah (eight) has more in home games than Hwang's six. What a turnaround it's been for the South Korean, who was deemed surplus to requirements by former Wolves boss Bruno Lage at the start of last season!
Furthermore, Hwang's eight Premier League goals this term are already as many as he managed in his two previous campaigns in the competition combined!
Lemina lets out a scream as he goes down holding his foot under a heavy challenge while pressing high for Wolves. Burnley play on, and Semedo has to turn a dangerous cross behind for a corner using his chest.
Lemina gets to his feet as Wolves prepare to defend the corner, which is cleared as far as Vitinho on the edge of the box. A wild swing from the full-back sends it out of play for a Bentley goal-kick.
Lemina goes down again following a challenge from Amdouni, but Wolves have possession and look to play on through Hwang… but his pass to Cunha is loose and Burnley survive a dangerous moment. Once again, Lemina is back to his feet in midfield after the attack breaks down.
Berge receives the second yellow card of the game, and he's in disbelief as Hugo Bueno goes down under a light challenge near the corner of Burnley's box. This is a dangerous free-kick for the Clarets to defend…
OVER! Sarabia swings a lovely set-piece delivery to the far post, where Lemina heads over a gaping goal from just a couple of yards out. However, the linesman lifts his flag for offside, sparing the midfielder's blushes.
There's a tense moment for Burnley as Sarabia's teasing cross is headed awkwardly into the air by O'Shea, and Taylor doesn't know Semedo is lurking behind him as he slices a rushed clearance out of play.
Wolves aren't happy as Lemina goes into the book for a foul on Berge. The Wolves man simply stepped cross his opponent and won the ball cleanly. He can't believe he's been booked as Burnley get a free-kick around 30 yards out.
Lemina, by the way, was sent off for dissent by today's referee as Wolves beat Southampton 2-1 in February. He joins the wall as Bruun Larsen lifts a poor free-kick well over Bentley's goal.
Hugo Bueno gets up on the overlap for Wolves, throwing in a stepover to beat Vitinho before seeing his chipped cross knocked behind for a left-wing corner. What can Wolves do from their latest set-piece?
CLOSE! Sarabia sends a dangerous set-piece delivery to the near post, where Berge turns just wide of his own goal with Trafford pinned back! Wolves get another corner.
BIG CHANCE! Wolves work their next corner short to Hwang, who lifts a deep cross towards Dawson. The big centre-back is far too strong for Brownhill as he reaches the dropping ball at the far post, side-footing across the face of goal, but there's nobody arriving to tap it in! Burnley survive a big scare.
Taylor is the next man into the book for dragging Lemina back on the Wolves right. That's three Burnley players on cautions.
Sarabia sends a lovely free-kick delivery towards Kilman, but Burnley just about manage to scramble it clear. Kompany seems to be preparing his next substitution, with Tresor readying himself on the sidelines.
Taylor needs to be careful here. Just moments after being booked, he chops Sarabia down on the Wolves right. The referee keeps his cards in his pocket on this occasion, though.
Burnley's players appeal for handball as Berge's cross deflects onto Semedo's arm at the far post, but there was absolutely nothing he could do to avoid that. There's no need for the VAR to take another look at that incident.
Sarabia sets off on the break for Wolves, before being brought down by Berge 20 yards from goal as he pulled his foot back to shoot. Berge avoids a second yellow card, but Wolves have a free-kick in an excellent position with Sarabia over it.
GOOD SAVE! Sarabia places the free-kick towards the top-left corner, but it's just lacking a tiny bit of power as Trafford springs to his right to tip it wide. The resulting corner is also delivered by Sarabia, but Hwang heads well wide at the front post.
Here comes Burnley's second change, with Tresor on for Bruun Larsen out wide.
It's another hearts-in-mouths moment for Burnley as a poor touch takes Trafford outside his box with Cunha chasing him down, and he slices a wild clearance out of play, much to the delight of the home fans. We're into the final 20 minutes of the 90 here, with Hwang's goal still the difference.
Another promising moment goes begging! Burnley play themselves into trouble yet again as Gomes pounces to send Hwang down the right wing on the break, but his cutback is just intercepted ahead of the onrushing Lemina!
Ekdal gets the most deserved yellow card you will ever see as Cunha nudges the ball past him on halfway, throwing his arms around the Brazilian's torso to stop the Wolves break.
We're into the final 15 minutes of the 90 and Burnley have not mounted a serious attack for some time. Having impressed for long spells in the first half, they've struggled to build up in the second, looking tentative since gifting Wolves the opening goal.
Cunha wins a free-kick on the Wolves left, which is quickly worked into his feet. He blasts a shot at goal from 30 yards out, but Trafford is behind it all the way.
Semedo fails to prevent Dawson's clearance from spinning behind for a Burnley corner. Kilman clears the set-piece at the second attempt, but Burnley come straight back and win another on the opposite side.
OVER! Burnley's second corner is cleared as far as Vitinho, who winds up a first-time strike from 20 yards out. It has Bentley worried, but whistles just over the top-right corner as Wolves escape.
Wolves finally make their first change as Bellegarde replaces Sarabia out wide.
Kilman is furious as Amdouni dives over his leg as he pulls out of a challenge, yet the referee books the Wolves captain and awards Burnley a free-kick 25 yards from goal, as we enter the final 10 minutes of the 90.
Tresor strikes from the dead ball… and his effort hits Cunha in the wall and flies over. The Burnley substitute takes the resulting corner short to work a better angle, and his cross is cleared by Dawson. Wolves are under pressure now.
Wolves are furious as Taylor – who has already been booked – avoids being penalised for dragging Hugo Bueno back. Vitinho then gets down the right to send in a low cross… which Bentley claims.
Burnley have lost each of their last three Premier League away games – they last had a longer losing run on the road in the division between November 2016 and February 2017 (seven). Can they avoid making it four straight road defeats here?
Cunha relieves the pressure by dropping back to steal possession from Berge, who trips him. Burnley have had a few fouls from players who have already been booked in recent minutes. That one was soft, but Berge is walking a fine line.
Trafford tries to pick out his centre-back under pressure from Hwang and drills a terrible pass out of play on the Burnley left. Hwang was close to getting a toe to that in the goalmouth!
Wolves are making a defensive change now, with O'Neil sending on ball-winning midfielder Traore in place of Cunha, who has gotten through plenty of off-the-ball work and assisted Hwang's goal.
The home fans are frustrated as Wolves waste a chance to kill the game off! Bellegarde somehow finds space to wriggle past two challenges inside a crowded penalty area, but rather than shooting on his left foot, he checks back to cross for Lemina and sees his pass cut out!
Wolves may be forced into another change here, with Hugo Bueno down on the left flank and looking to be suffering from a touch of cramp. The medical team are on to treat him, and Doherty is preparing to enter the action.
Doherty is sent on for Hugo Bueno at left wing-back, as the fourth official signals we will have THREE minutes of stoppage time. Can Wolves hang on?
Burnley are also throwing the dice at the last. Redmond comes on for Ekdal.
Odobert is also brought on by Kompany, with Vitinho replaced.
Burnley neglect to give the ball back to Wolves, who had played it out to allow Hugo Bueno to be treated deep inside the Clarets' half. The home fans aren't pleased at all.
Burnley win a late corner as a right-wing cross is turned behind by Lemina. Trafford will come up for this one. It's surely the last chance for the visitors!
Gomes scrambles clear from the corner but Burnley come again and win a throw-in... It's hosted into the middle, where Rodriguez commits a clear foul on Gomes. That will surely be that at Molineux!
FULL-TIME: WOLVES 1-0 BURNLEY.
The full-time whistle sounds at Molineux as Wolves hold on for a hard-fought win over Burnley! In a game of few chances in the West Midlands, Wolves' leading goalscorer Hwang made the difference by making O'Shea and Berge pay for a mix-up at the back three minutes before the break, taking in Cunha's pass before rolling a finish into the bottom-left corner. Sarabia and Dawson missed chances to extend their lead after the break, when Burnley seemed to run out of momentum. They will be ruing a phenomenal double save from Wolves' stand-in goalkeeper Bentley, who denied Rodriguez and Brownhill in stunning fashion shortly before the Clarets went behind. Wolves put further distance between themselves and the strugglers ahead of Saturday's home game against Nottingham Forest, while Burnley miss the chance to jump out of the bottom three. They go to Brighton in their next Premier League fixture this weekend. Until then, it's goodbye from us, and we'll see you next time!"	"Second-half goals from Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson earned Chelsea a comfortable 2-0 win over Sheffield United at Stamford Bridge.
Palmer registered a goal and an assist for the Blues, whose first victory in three matches moves Mauricio Pochettino's side back into the top half of the table.
How the match unfolded
Chelsea captain Conor Gallagher had the first good chance of the game after 15 minutes. He intercepted Auston Trusty's pass before forcing a save from Wes Foderingham.
Chelsea took the lead in the 54th minute when Raheem Sterling’s low cross was smashed in by Palmer from six yards out.
Palmer then turned provider seven minutes later for Jackson to double Chelsea’s lead. Foderingham managed to keep out Sterling's effort, but Palmer kept the ball in play and gave Jackson an easy finish into an empty net.
Max Lowe then made a crucial challenge to stop Palmer from getting on the end of a cutback inside the box from Mykhailo Mudryk.
Sterling had a great chance to make it 3-0 when he got on the end of a long pass from Thiago Silva, but Foderingham did well to smother the winger's effort. 
Djordje Petrovic, who was making his first Premier League start for Chelsea, was called into action for the first time in the 70th minute as kept out Gustavo Hamer's free-kick.
Substitute Armando Broja squandered a huge opportunity to add a third for Chelsea, missing an open goal from five yards out, while Foderingham made a double save late on from Palmer’s free-kick and Jackson’s rebound.
Chelsea are now in 10th place with 22 points, while Sheff Utd remain bottom with eight points.

Full-back Jonny Otto has been exiled following what O'Neil described as a ""training ground incident"", so young midfielder Chirewa keeps his place on the bench.
Kompany makes just one change to the Team_6 lineup which began Saturday's thrashing of Team_17, with defender Jordan Beyer suspended due to an accumulation of yellow cards. Ekdal comes in alongside former West Bromwich Albion defender O'Shea in the heart of their backline. The likes of Jack Cork, Josh Cullen and Lyle Foster are absent.
Team_20 have both scored and conceded in each of their last 11 league games. They last had a longer such run between August and October 1985 in the third tier (12 games). Are we in for an entertaining contest here? The teams are out, and kick-off is rapidly approaching!
We're under way at Molineux for the first of the Premier League's full set of midweek fixtures! Hwang with the first kick for Team_20.
Team_20 are looking to move the ball patiently in their 3-4-3 shape in the early moments. It's worked out to Semedo on the right-hand touchline, and he's fouled by Koleosho.
We have a booking inside 90 seconds here as Kilman charges out of the Team_20 backline to carry the ball through the lines. Brownhill lunges in to bring him down, and the Team_6 skipper is walking a tightrope already.
Lemina is potentially fortunate to avoid an early booking of his own after hauling Koleosho down on the Team_6 left. Bruun Larsen delivers the resulting free-kick, but an old gold shirt is there to clear.
Team_20 have scored at least once in each of their last 13 Premier League home games, their longest such run since a run of 14 between April 2019 and January 2020. However, they've also failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their last seven in the league at Molineux.
Team_6 are pressing high and forcing errors from Team_20 early on, with Koleosho pressuring Kilman into a sliced clearance. However, the Clarets are forced back from the resulting throw-in and misplace a pass out of play on halfway.
Team_20 are living a little dangerously as Bentley just manages to play a side-footed pass around Rodriguez under pressure inside his own area. Almost all of the game has been played in the hosts' half thus far. This is a big opportunity for Bentley, with first-choice goalkeeper Sa missing out with a minor back injury.
Team_20 look to have a three-on-one on the counterattack for a brief moment, but Sarabia doesn't get his head up quickly enough to find Hwang or Semedo and eventually concedes possession. The Spaniard was the hero against Team_18 in Team_20' last home game with a goal and an assist in stoppage time, and he's started on the left of O'Neil's front three here.
Hugo Bueno breaks over halfway for Team_20, but he lacks support and is felled by a hard-but-fair challenge from Vitinho. Team_20 are quickly back in possession, however, as they look to work their way into this game after a low-key opening.
Having won their first three Premier League meetings with Team_6 between 2009 and 2018, Team_20 are now winless in their last seven against them in the competition (three draws, four defeats).
Team_6 right-back Vitinho appears to be hobbling after making that earlier challenge on Hugo Bueno. Team_20 work the ball out to their left in a bid to test him, and O'Shea has to come over to head Sarabia's floated cross away.
It's been a very tame start to this game, with neither team managing a shot of any description as we approach the 15-minute mark. Both sides look to be feeling each other out at Molineux.
Good goalkeeping! Team_6 stand off Kilman, who launches a throughball over the top of the Clarets' block, looking for Sarabia. O'Neil applauds the intention, but it just runs too long and Trafford comes off his line to claim it.
A big cheer goes up as Bruun Larsen takes a poor touch under pressure from Toti, flicking the ball directly out of play. It's all been very cautious thus far.
Berge skips into the area before offloading to Bruun Larsen, who lays it off for Brownhill on the edge of the box. He attempts the first shot of the game, and it deflects well wide for a corner. Bentley played Team_20 into trouble again at the start of that move...
Team_6 go for a corner-kick routine off the training ground, working it neatly into Brownhill, but his looping cross is beyond the navy shirts at the far post as Team_20 get the goal-kick.
This is a decent spell for Team_6! Koleosho beats Semedo at the second time of asking before hammering a shot off from near the corner of the box, but an old gold shirt is there to block. The home fans are starting to grow frustrated.
Team_20 have completely failed to get Hwang or Cunha into the game so far, as the Brazilian is crowded out in midfield. Hwang has scored five goals in his six Premier League home games for Team_20 this season, with their 2-1 win against Team_18 last time out here the only time he's failed to score at Molineux in the league this term. The last player to net more home league goals for the club in a single campaign was Raul Jimenez in 2019-20 (eight).
Close! Team_6 are controlling this game well, but Trafford almost makes a costly error as his slack pass is inches away from being intercepted by Hwang. The Clarets survive, though, and Koleosho goes up the other end to win a left-wing corner.
Amdouni nods the inswinging corner goalwards, and it crashes off a gold shirt before dropping to Taylor on the edge of the box. The left-back takes a wild swing and lifts his volley miles over the bar, but O'Neil is not happy, gesticulating for Team_20 to up the tempo!
SAVE! Trafford is tested for the first time as Sarabia's strike loops up off Vitinho, and it looks like it might be dropping under the crossbar. The Team_6 goalkeeper takes no chances, tipping it over for a corner.
There are groans around Molineux as, after a long build-up, Sarabia fails to beat the first Team_6 defender from the left-wing corner. The hosts have yet to get going.
CLOSE! That's the best chance of the game so far! Semedo finally injects some pace into Team_20' game, charging past Taylor on the right-hand side before lifting a cross into the area. Sarabia arrives on it somewhat awkwardly and has to prod his shot with the outside of his left boot, and it's just too high to find the top-right corner!
There's a concerning moment for Team_6 as Koleosho stays down, rubbing his lower leg after a tangle with Hugo Bueno. The young winger receives treatment and he seems able to rejoin the action – it looks like a contact injury which he can run off.
Team_20 are enjoying a better spell now, moving the ball patiently. They need more of the pace Semedo showed in that last attack – he breezed past Taylor to create a good chance for Sarabia.
Comfortable save! Team_6 record their first shot on target as Amdouni finds a pocket of space behind Team_20' double pivot, but his 25-yard effort lacks power and Bentley can simply fall on it.
Danger! Sarabia switches flanks, popping up on the Team_20 right to thread a cute pass through for Semedo. He drives a cutback towards the six-yard box, looking for Cunha, but Ekdal does well to clear at his near post.
WAYWARD! Amdouni skips away from Lemina on the break before finding Bruun Larsen in an inside-right position. He skips inside Toti to shoot, but blasts his wild effort high and wide.
This is a major blow for Team_6. Koleosho is feeling his lower leg again and he won't be able to continue. Gudmunds­son replaces him on the Clarets' left.
Everything positive from a Team_20 point of view has come down their right-hand side. Hwang is out there this time to get in behind Taylor before lifting a cross onto the six-yard line, but O'Shea nods it up into the air and into the gloves of Trafford.
HUGE DOUBLE SAVE FROM BENTLEY! Team_6 are almost gifted the opener, but Bentley keeps them out! Gomes tries an ill-advised backheel under pressure on the byline, allowing Gudmundsson to recover possession and cross low for Rodriguez. His close-range finish is smothered by Bentley, who then dives to his right to tip Brownhill's follow-up wide of the post! Great goalkeeping!
The home fans are growing restless as we enter the final five minutes of this opening period. Team_20 have been lacklustre and if not for their stand-in goalkeeper, they would be behind!
Gomes does brilliantly to ride a challenge from Brownhill before being hauled to the ground by Berge, relieving a spell of Team_6 pressure. Team_20 want a yellow card for the Clarets man, but none is forthcoming.
GOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLL! HWANG PUTS Team_20 AHEAD! Team_6 are architects of their own downfall in a huge way! O'Shea receives a pass out from Trafford, but his next ball into Berge is too heavy and the midfielder takes a loose touch. Sarabia pounces to flick it into Cunha, who plays it right to Hwang, and the South Korean sits his man down with a lovely stutter before stroking into the bottom-left corner. Team_20 lead 1-0!
Cunha gets the assist, unselfishly picking out Hwang when he could have gone for goal himself. The South Korean did the rest brilliantly.
All of a sudden, there's a hunger about Team_20 as they press Team_6 with greater intensity. Kompany will be fuming with that goal. The Clarets had been in control, but they made their own problems again there!
We will have four minutes of stoppage time before the break, presumably owing to Koleosho's earlier injury.
Team_6 look to finish the half with a flourish as their centre-backs are waved forward for a Vitinho long throw. Dawson slices an awful clearance up in the air, but O'Shea's attempt to cross is even worse, setting Semedo off on a counterattack on the far side.
Team_6 get men behind the ball to slow that Team_20 break, then Ekdal almost sells Taylor short with a pass inside his own half. The Clarets' attempts to play out are admirable, but they need to cut out those errors.
Almost! Cunha brings the ball out of the sky with a delicate touch to find Sarabia, who looks to send Lemina through on goal. The Team_20 midfielder is matched stride for stride by O'Shea, though, and the Team_6 defender makes a crucial block to deny Team_20 a clear route to goal.
HALF-TIME: Team_20 1-0 Team_6.
Jarred Gillett brings a slow burner of a first half to a close at Molineux, and Hwang's goal is the difference at the break as Team_20 lead Team_6 1-0. O'Neil's team have looked far from assured, though, with Team_6 recording more than twice as many shots as their hosts (eight to three). The Clarets' best chances came when Bentley made a stunning double save to deny Rodriguez and Brownhill after 38 minutes, and Kompany's men were behind just four minutes later when a poor pass out from the back allowed Cunha to tee up Hwang, who finished in lethal fashion for his eighth Premier League goal of the season. It's still all to play for in the second half, which is coming up shortly!
Despite the scoreline, O'Neil will be desperate for an improvement from Team_20 after the break. They've been too pedestrian in their passing and caused their own problems with errors at the back, but they lead due to Team_6 committing a mistake of their own at the other end! Kompany will believe Team_6 can get back into this game, though the loss of Koleosho to injury represents a big blow.
Team_6 get the second half under way at Molineux, with no changes made by either side at half-time. Team_6 were, of course, forced to withdraw Koleosho earlier.
Team_6 have already aimed two or three long balls towards the Team_20 right-back area in the opening moments of the second half. It will be interesting to see if they adopt a more direct style after playing themselves into trouble for Hwang's goal.
Gudmundsson checks back to cross on his left foot, and Dawson's headed clearance only finds a navy shirt as Team_6 look to pen Team_20 back in the opening moments of the second period.
Only Erling Haaland (14), Mohamed Salah (10) and Son Heung-min (nine) have scored more Premier League goals than Hwang (eight) this season, while only Salah (eight) has more in home games than Hwang's six. What a turnaround it's been for the South Korean, who was deemed surplus to requirements by former Team_20 boss Bruno Lage at the start of last season!
Furthermore, Hwang's eight Premier League goals this term are already as many as he managed in his two previous campaigns in the competition combined!
Lemina lets out a scream as he goes down holding his foot under a heavy challenge while pressing high for Team_20. Team_6 play on, and Semedo has to turn a dangerous cross behind for a corner using his chest.
Lemina gets to his feet as Team_20 prepare to defend the corner, which is cleared as far as Vitinho on the edge of the box. A wild swing from the full-back sends it out of play for a Bentley goal-kick.
Lemina goes down again following a challenge from Amdouni, but Team_20 have possession and look to play on through Hwang… but his pass to Cunha is loose and Team_6 survive a dangerous moment. Once again, Lemina is back to his feet in midfield after the attack breaks down.
Berge receives the second yellow card of the game, and he's in disbelief as Hugo Bueno goes down under a light challenge near the corner of Team_6 box. This is a dangerous free-kick for the Clarets to defend…
OVER! Sarabia swings a lovely set-piece delivery to the far post, where Lemina heads over a gaping goal from just a couple of yards out. However, the linesman lifts his flag for offside, sparing the midfielder's blushes.
There's a tense moment for Team_6 as Sarabia's teasing cross is headed awkwardly into the air by O'Shea, and Taylor doesn't know Semedo is lurking behind him as he slices a rushed clearance out of play.
Team_20 aren't happy as Lemina goes into the book for a foul on Berge. The Team_20 man simply stepped cross his opponent and won the ball cleanly. He can't believe he's been booked as Team_6 get a free-kick around 30 yards out.
Lemina, by the way, was sent off for dissent by today's referee as Team_20 beat Southampton 2-1 in February. He joins the wall as Bruun Larsen lifts a poor free-kick well over Bentley's goal.
Hugo Bueno gets up on the overlap for Team_20, throwing in a stepover to beat Vitinho before seeing his chipped cross knocked behind for a left-wing corner. What can Team_20 do from their latest set-piece?
CLOSE! Sarabia sends a dangerous set-piece delivery to the near post, where Berge turns just wide of his own goal with Trafford pinned back! Team_20 get another corner.
BIG CHANCE! Team_20 work their next corner short to Hwang, who lifts a deep cross towards Dawson. The big centre-back is far too strong for Brownhill as he reaches the dropping ball at the far post, side-footing across the face of goal, but there's nobody arriving to tap it in! Team_6 survive a big scare.
Taylor is the next man into the book for dragging Lemina back on the Team_20 right. That's three Team_6 players on cautions.
Sarabia sends a lovely free-kick delivery towards Kilman, but Team_6 just about manage to scramble it clear. Kompany seems to be preparing his next substitution, with Tresor readying himself on the sidelines.
Taylor needs to be careful here. Just moments after being booked, he chops Sarabia down on the Team_20 right. The referee keeps his cards in his pocket on this occasion, though.
Team_6 players appeal for handball as Berge's cross deflects onto Semedo's arm at the far post, but there was absolutely nothing he could do to avoid that. There's no need for the VAR to take another look at that incident.
Sarabia sets off on the break for Team_20, before being brought down by Berge 20 yards from goal as he pulled his foot back to shoot. Berge avoids a second yellow card, but Team_20 have a free-kick in an excellent position with Sarabia over it.
GOOD SAVE! Sarabia places the free-kick towards the top-left corner, but it's just lacking a tiny bit of power as Trafford springs to his right to tip it wide. The resulting corner is also delivered by Sarabia, but Hwang heads well wide at the front post.
Here comes Team_6 second change, with Tresor on for Bruun Larsen out wide.
It's another hearts-in-mouths moment for Team_6 as a poor touch takes Trafford outside his box with Cunha chasing him down, and he slices a wild clearance out of play, much to the delight of the home fans. We're into the final 20 minutes of the 90 here, with Hwang's goal still the difference.
Another promising moment goes begging! Team_6 play themselves into trouble yet again as Gomes pounces to send Hwang down the right wing on the break, but his cutback is just intercepted ahead of the onrushing Lemina!
Ekdal gets the most deserved yellow card you will ever see as Cunha nudges the ball past him on halfway, throwing his arms around the Brazilian's torso to stop the Team_20 break.
We're into the final 15 minutes of the 90 and Team_6 have not mounted a serious attack for some time. Having impressed for long spells in the first half, they've struggled to build up in the second, looking tentative since gifting Team_20 the opening goal.
Cunha wins a free-kick on the Team_20 left, which is quickly worked into his feet. He blasts a shot at goal from 30 yards out, but Trafford is behind it all the way.
Semedo fails to prevent Dawson's clearance from spinning behind for a Team_6 corner. Kilman clears the set-piece at the second attempt, but Team_6 come straight back and win another on the opposite side.
OVER! Team_6 second corner is cleared as far as Vitinho, who winds up a first-time strike from 20 yards out. It has Bentley worried, but whistles just over the top-right corner as Team_20 escape.
Team_20 finally make their first change as Bellegarde replaces Sarabia out wide.
Kilman is furious as Amdouni dives over his leg as he pulls out of a challenge, yet the referee books the Team_20 captain and awards Team_6 a free-kick 25 yards from goal, as we enter the final 10 minutes of the 90.
Tresor strikes from the dead ball… and his effort hits Cunha in the wall and flies over. The Team_6 substitute takes the resulting corner short to work a better angle, and his cross is cleared by Dawson. Team_20 are under pressure now.
Team_20 are furious as Taylor – who has already been booked – avoids being penalised for dragging Hugo Bueno back. Vitinho then gets down the right to send in a low cross… which Bentley claims.
Team_6 have lost each of their last three Premier League away games – they last had a longer losing run on the road in the division between November 2016 and February 2017 (seven). Can they avoid making it four straight road defeats here?
Cunha relieves the pressure by dropping back to steal possession from Berge, who trips him. Team_6 have had a few fouls from players who have already been booked in recent minutes. That one was soft, but Berge is walking a fine line.
Trafford tries to pick out his centre-back under pressure from Hwang and drills a terrible pass out of play on the Team_6 left. Hwang was close to getting a toe to that in the goalmouth!
Team_20 are making a defensive change now, with O'Neil sending on ball-winning midfielder Traore in place of Cunha, who has gotten through plenty of off-the-ball work and assisted Hwang's goal.
The home fans are frustrated as Team_20 waste a chance to kill the game off! Bellegarde somehow finds space to wriggle past two challenges inside a crowded penalty area, but rather than shooting on his left foot, he checks back to cross for Lemina and sees his pass cut out!
Team_20 may be forced into another change here, with Hugo Bueno down on the left flank and looking to be suffering from a touch of cramp. The medical team are on to treat him, and Doherty is preparing to enter the action.
Doherty is sent on for Hugo Bueno at left wing-back, as the fourth official signals we will have THREE minutes of stoppage time. Can Team_20 hang on?
Team_6 are also throwing the dice at the last. Redmond comes on for Ekdal.
Odobert is also brought on by Kompany, with Vitinho replaced.
Team_6 neglect to give the ball back to Team_20, who had played it out to allow Hugo Bueno to be treated deep inside the Clarets' half. The home fans aren't pleased at all.
Team_6 win a late corner as a right-wing cross is turned behind by Lemina. Trafford will come up for this one. It's surely the last chance for the visitors!
Gomes scrambles clear from the corner but Team_6 come again and win a throw-in... It's hosted into the middle, where Rodriguez commits a clear foul on Gomes. That will surely be that at Molineux!
FULL-TIME: Team_20 1-0 Team_6.
The full-time whistle sounds at Molineux as Team_20 hold on for a hard-fought win over Team_6! In a game of few chances in the West Midlands, Team_20' leading goalscorer Hwang made the difference by making O'Shea and Berge pay for a mix-up at the back three minutes before the break, taking in Cunha's pass before rolling a finish into the bottom-left corner. Sarabia and Dawson missed chances to extend their lead after the break, when Team_6 seemed to run out of momentum. They will be ruing a phenomenal double save from Team_20' stand-in goalkeeper Bentley, who denied Rodriguez and Brownhill in stunning fashion shortly before the Clarets went behind. Team_20 put further distance between themselves and the strugglers ahead of Saturday's home game against Team_16, while Team_6 miss the chance to jump out of the bottom three. They go to Team_5 in their next Premier League fixture this weekend. Until then, it's goodbye from us, and we'll see you next time!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93415	Chelsea	Brentford	2023-10-28	Stamford Bridge, London	39575.0	Simon Hooper	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Burnley and Chelsea at Turf Moor.
Burnley beat Luton Town in their previous Premier League match to secure their first top-flight win since gaining promotion from the Championship. Elijah Adebayo scored in the 84th minute to cancel out Lyle Foster’s opener, only for Jacob Bruun Larsen to curl in a superb winner 65 seconds later. Vincent Kompany’s men had lost five of their six games before their away victory, with their only point coming in a 1-1 draw against Nottingham Forest. Burnley will be looking to secure back-to-back wins but must improve their form at Turf Moor. They have been defeated in all four of their home games this season; only four teams in top-flight history have ever lost their first five on home soil in a single campaign – Manchester United in 1930-31, Portsmouth in 2009-10, Bolton Wanderers in 2011-12 and Newcastle United in 2018-19.
Chelsea have had an indifferent start to the campaign under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and are currently 11th in the Premier League with eight points in their seven matches. The Blues ended their three-game winless run with a comfortable 2-0 win over Fulham in their last game, with their only other triumph in the top-flight coming against newly promoted Luton. They will be focusing on securing a place in European football next season but are currently five points behind West Ham, who are in seventh position. However, Chelsea will be confident that they can secure another win against Burnley as they have been victorious in seven of their last eight fixtures at Turf Moor, drawing the other one. No team has played more away games against an opponent in the competition without losing.
BURNLEY (4-3-3): James Trafford; Vitinho, Ameen Al Dakhil, Hannes Delcroix, Charlie Taylor; Sander Berge, Josh Cullen, Josh Brownhill; Wilson Odobert, Lyle Foster, Mike Tresor.
BURNLEY SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Dara O’Shea, Jack Cork, Jay Rodriguez, Connor Roberts, Aaron Ramsey, Zeki Amdouni, Luca Koleosho, Jacob Bruun Larsen.
CHELSEA (4-3-3): Robert Sanchez; Marc Cucurella, Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez; Cole Palmer, Armando Broja, Raheem Sterling.
CHELSEA SUBS: Djordje Petrovic, Mykhailo Mudryk, Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Lesley Ugochukwu, Carney Chukwuemeka, Ian Maatsen, Alfie Gilchrist, Alex Matos.
Burnley make four changes to the side that beat Luton during the week. Jordan Beyer misses out through injury and is replaced at centre-back by Delcroix. Vitinho comes in at right-back and takes the place of Roberts. Tresor and Odobert start in the Premier League for the first time and appear on the wings, with Koleosho and Amdouni dropping into the bench.
Chelsea make one alteration to the team that beat Fulham in their last match. Mudryk scored against the Cottagers but is replaced by Sterling. Jackson is back in the squad after his suspension for accumulating five yellow cards.
Burnley manager Kompany could become the fourth manager to lose his first five Premier League home games in charge, after Mick McCarthy in 2003, Terry Connor in 2012 and Chris Ramsey in 2015. Kompany would be the first to do so from the start of a campaign. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get the game started.
Chelsea get this Premier League clash under way. Broja with the first pass of the game.
Sterling darts down the left and wins an early corner. However, Gallagher's inswinging cross is cleared out of the box. Palmer keeps the ball on the pitch, but he is tackled and Burnley have possession.
Chelsea attack down the left again. Sterling bursts forward with possession before sliding a pass into the path of Colwill, who overlaps him. He is put under pressure by Vitinho and gets a cross into the box, but it comes to nothing.
Palmer drops deep to receive the ball in the middle of the pitch before curling a pass down the left to Colwill. He attempts to flash a low cross into the box, but Vitinho makes a crucial interception. The ball spins off him and bounces back to Trafford.
Burnley are not putting Chelsea's defence under any pressure and are letting them pass the ball from side to side. Disasi looks up and spots the run of Sterling, who rushes behind Burnley defence, but the winger is unable to get it under control.
Palmer shows quick feet to roll past Odobert and move into space outside the box. He attempts to curl a shot across the goal and into the top corner, but his effort goes well over the target.
Palmer has been given a free role in this Chelsea side and appears on the right this time. He switches the ball over to the right, with Sterling controlling it well outside the box. He beats Vitinho, but Tresor gets his body across to win possession.
WIDE! Chelsea are the first team to go close. Sterling collects the ball on the left and darts inside, dribbling past Vitinho. The former Manchester City man then whips a low shot just around the post.
GOALLLL! 1-0 BURNLEY! The hosts have been behind the ball for most of the game but score with their first shot. Foster receives possession on the left and moves inside of Disasi and into the box. He is put under pressure by Silva, but is able to slide a pass across to Odobert. He takes one touch before driving his shot across the goal and into the bottom corner.
Foster moved forward with possession but slowed his run down to allow other players to get forward. He dribbles through Silva and Disasi before finding Odobert, who finishes with composure.
Chelsea have failed to win in their last 19 matches when conceding the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to 1st October 2022 against Crystal Palace.
There has not been a lot of action since Burnley netted the opener. Sterling has made a couple of surging runs down the left, but nothing has come from it. The away side are trying to target Vitinho.
CHANCE! Odobert moves down the left with the ball and cuts inside before clipping a cross into the heart of the box. Tresor gets there ahead of Colwill, but he is unable to direct his effort towards the goal.
Burnley are playing their natural game and are not rushing in possession. They are allowing Chelsea to put them under pressure and are releasing the ball in the final moment before getting tackled.
Fernandez has the ball in the middle of the pitch and tries to chip a pass into the path of Palmer, who rushes inside from the right to try and get onto the end of it. However, Taylor gets across to shield it, allowing Trafford to come out and claim.
Cucurella is shown the first yellow card of the game for a swipe on Odobert, who jumped over his challenge before going to the floor.
Fernandez goes into the book a few seconds later after complaining about the decision. He is still talking to the referee alongside Gallagher.
Fernandez played a lot of simple passes in the early stages of the game but is now attempting to go for a more direct approach. However, the Burnley defence are doing well to deal with the danger and are not allowing Sterling or Palmer to receive it.
Cullen is the first Burnley player to be given a yellow card after pulling Sterling's shirt.
TACKLE! What a challenge from Cullen inside the box. Gallagher has the ball on the right and chips a cross into the box. It goes over the head of Broja but straight to Fernandez, who is unmarked. He takes a touch before Cullen slides across to concede a corner.
Delcroix gives the ball straight to Chelsea inside Burnley's half, with the away side wasting an immediate chance to pounce before recycling possession. Fernandez has it on the right and curls a cross towards Sterling, who tries to get on the end of it. However, Cullen is there and he helps it back to Trafford.
SAVE! Good stop from Trafford. Cucurella, Fernandez and Caicedo combine with some quick passing before the latter of the three sends a pass down the left to Sterling. he drives into the box before blasting a low shot straight at Trafford.
Odobert is shown a yellow card. That's the fourth booking of the half.
Burnley have been behind the ball for most of the half but have looked strong defensively. Their rigid structure has stopped Chelsea from creating many clear chances, with the hosts heading away the majority of their crosses.
OWN GOAL! 1-1! Chelsea score a fortunate equaliser. Sterling receives possession on the left and drives towards the byline before blasting a cross into a dangerous area. The ball hits Al Dakhil and loops over Trafford before going in.
Burnley have conceded four goals in the last 15 minutes of the first half, no team has conceded more in the Premier League this season.
Chelsea are patient with possession outside the box. Sterling then looks to chip a pass over the top of Burnley's defence and into the path of Broja, but he puts too much on it.
There will be three minutes of additional time. Chelsea have momentum in this game after scoring.
Silva is the third Chelsea player to be shown a yellow card after blocking the path of a Vitinho, who was breaking forward.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 1-1 CHELSEA
Burnley scored with their only shot on target of the half but are heading into the break level with Chelsea after an own goal from Al Dakhil. The Blues dominated possession across the half but only had a couple of clear opportunities. Sterling whipped a shot just wide of the post before the hosts broke the deadlock. Foster dribbled through the middle of Silva and Disasi before finding Odobert inside the box. He drove his shot across the goal and into the bottom corner. Fernandez was denied a scoring chance after a phenomenal tackle from Cullen before Chelsea netted an equaliser. Sterling dribbled down the left and approached the byline before cutting a cross into the box, with the ball deflecting off Al Dakhil and into the net.
Burnley showed defensive resilience before the break and are slightly unfortunate not to be leading. They defended their box brilliantly and stopped Chelsea from getting shots away from good positions. The Blues' only attempt on target came from Sterling, whose attempt from a narrow angle was never beating Trafford. They countered clinically but have not provided an attacking threat since scoring the opener. As for the away side, they have tried their best to remain patient. They have controlled possession and have shown flashes of quality but have not put Burnley under pressure enough. Sterling has been one of their best players and has constantly looked to beat Vitinho.
Broja struggled to get into the game before the break and is now coming off. Jackson takes his place in the attack.
Al Dakhil scored the own goal that got Chelsea back into the game. He is coming off for O'Shea at centre-back.
Burnley get the ball rolling again.
PENALTY CHELSEA! Sterling isolates Vitinho on the left and pushes the ball past him before bursting around the defender. The right-back makes a late slide tackle and takes him down. There is a quick VAR check to make sure the tackle was made inside the box.
GOALLL! PALMER SCORES! 2-1 CHELSEA! What a start to the half for Chelsea. Summer signing Palmer takes responsibility from the spot and rolls his effort down the right side of the goal. Trafford dives the other way.
Burnley have started the half poorly. They have given possession away on several occasions in their own defensive third and are putting themselves under a lot of early pressure.
SAVE! Burnley have had the ball for the last couple of minutes. Odobert rushes inside from the left and brushes away a defender before curling a shot towards the goal. It goes straight down the middle but it is dipping, forcing Sanchez to push it over.
Palmer receives possession on the right just past the halfway line and curls a pass down the wing towards Gallagher. The captain heads it past Delcroix and gets past the defender before the Burnley man makes a fantastic recovery tackle.
WHAT A MOVE! Chelsea go close to scoring again. The Blues win possession in Burnley's defensive third, with Sterling rushing inside before finding Jackson in the box. The striker delivers a clever flick back to Fernandez, who shoots straight at Trafford.
Chelsea are looking to win consecutive Premier League games for the first time since March, while they last won back-to-back away league games in October last season.
Kompany has seen enough and has decided to make three changes to try and change the outcome of the game. Vitinho has struggled against Sterling and is now being replaced by Roberts.
Tresor has had a quiet game in Burnley's attack. He is comes off for Koleosho.
There is also a straight swap in the midfield. Ramsey replaces Cullen.
Palmer has been impressive in this game and scored the goal to put Chelsea in front, but has a moment to forget as he dribbles the ball straight off the pitch. The home fans enjoyed that.
GOALLL! STERLING SCORES! 3-1 CHELSEA! Sterling was vital in the Blues' first two goals and now has one to his name. Caicedo wins possession just inside Burnley's half and plays a pass into the feet of Gallagher. He rushes forward before sliding a throughball into Sterling, who finishes clinically. There was a VAR check for offside, but the goal stands.
Gallagher has Jackson ahead of him but picks Sterling to his left, with the winger in plenty of space inside the box. He is composed and blasts his shot into the corner.
Burnley have won just one of their 16 Premier League matches against Chelsea (drawing four and losing 11), a 3-2 away win in August 2017 when the Blues were reigning champions.
Chelsea have controlled the game since taking the lead and deserved their third goal. They have progressed through the pitch with pace and have made the most of the space that Burnley have left.
Gallagher drifts out to the right before feeding a pass into Palmer, who is just inside the box. He attempts to poke a pass through to Jackson, but Delcroix gets across to make a tackle.
Burnley are struggling to get out of their own half and after spells of possession, they clear the ball up the pitch when put under pressure down the wings.
Caicedo tries to control the ball under no pressure inside Chelsea's half, but it gets away from the midfielder. He then boots it away in frustration and is shown a yellow card.
GOALLL! JACKSON SCORES! 4-1 CHELSEA! What a goal from Jackson. Sterling holds off a defender before rolling past him. He bursts down the left and flashes a cross into the box that is recovered by Palmer. He plays it back across to Jackson, who turns past O'Shea and fires a low shot into the net.
Palmer adds an assist to his name after scoring. He waits for the right moment to find Jackson in the middle of the box after deciding against shooting. The striker has a defender ahead of him but shows skill to get past him to score.
Having won five and drawn two of his first seven Premier League meetings with Burnley, Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino lost his last game against the Clarets, going down 2-1 with Spurs in February 2019. However, the Argentine has won 85.4 per cent of his Premier League games against promoted sides (35/41), the highest ratio of any manager to take charge of at least 10 such matches. He is about to add another win onto his record.
BLOCK! Koleosho twists onto his left foot on the right flank and chips a pass across to Odobert on the edge. His first-time effort is goal-bound, but it gets blocked.
Odobert scored the opener and has shown flashes of quality, but is now coming off. Larsen takes his place.
Roberts launches a throw-in into the middle of the box. It bounces around before Disasi clears it away.

Palmer tries to get the better of Delcroix down the right, but the centre-back matches his run. The ball rolls back to Trafford and the winger goes down.
Palmer comes off after an eclectic performance on the wing. Maatsen is on against his former side and is applauded by parts of Turf Moor.
Mudryk displays his pace with a fast run down the left. He gets towards the byline and has a chance to flash a cross into the path of Maatsen on the other side but cuts it back to Jackson in the middle. His touch is poor and his flick back to Fernandez is intercepted.
There will be seven minutes of additional time. Burnley have started to commit a couple of fouls in frustration.
The tempo of the game has lowered since Chelsea netted their fourth goal of the game. Larsen gets onto the end of a long ball forward and is beyond Cucurella, but his touch is poor, allowing the left-back to get back.
OVER! Brownhill has the ball on the edge of Chelsea's box and pokes a pass around Fernandez. Foster collects it and shoots just over the bar.
Foster has made a couple of good runs in the last couple of minutes but has not been found by his team-mates. He sticks his thumbs up after one of the balls through to him escapes his control, with Sanchez coming off his line to gain possession.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 1-4 CHELSEA
Chelsea scored three second-half goals to come from behind and beat Burnley at Turf Moor. Sterling curled a low shot from outside the box just wide of the post before Burnley netted the opener. Foster dribbled through Silva and Disasi, with the striker passing the ball across the box to Odobert, who drove his shot into the bottom corner. Sterling blasted an effort at Trafford before playing a crucial role in the Blues' comeback. The winger dribbled towards the byline and put a cross into the box that deflected off Al Dakhil and over Trafford to level the score. Sterling was causing havoc down the left and won a penalty after being fouled by Vitinho. Palmer took responsibility and rolled his spot-kick down the right side of the goal. Fernandez curled a shot into the gloves of the goalkeeper before Sterling bagged Chelsea's third. He got onto the end of Gallagher's throughball and finished the chance with composure.

Foster looked to net a consolation in stoppage time, but he struck his effort just over.
Burnley have been defeated in their first five games at Turf Moor in the Premier League this season. They travel to Brentford after the international break. Chelsea have won their last two games in the league after securing just one victory in their first six outings. They host Arsenal in their next match before games against Brentford, Tottenham, Manchester City and Newcastle United in the top-flight.
That's all for today, goodbye."	"Goals from Ethan Pinnock and Bryan Mbeumo made history for Brentford as they became the first ever Premier League team to win their first three trips to Chelsea, triumphing 2-0.
The Bees also extended their unbeaten run in Premier League London derbies to 13 matches, continuing a club-record sequence, while they have now won four straight away matches in the capital for the first time in their league history.
And to compound Chelsea's woes at Stamford Bridge, the Blues have now won fewer matches at their ground than Brentford since April, with the Bees claiming two successes in that time.
Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino made three changes to the team that had earned an encouraging 2-2 draw with Arsenal, with Axel Disasi, Noni Madueke and Nicolas Jackson starting in place of Malo Gusto, Mkyhailo Mudryk and Enzo Fernandez, with the latter two absent from the squad due to minor injuries.
Chelsea put Brentford under real pressure in the first half, with summer signing Cole Palmer finding pockets of space while the Bees struggled to break through Chelsea's press.
Madueke hit the woodwork from the right side of the box, before Palmer played in Raheem Sterling, whose rushed shot flew high and wide.
But it was a different story in the second half as Brentford made a fast start.
In the 50th minute a low driven cross was met by Vitaly Janelt, who was denied by a strong hand from Robert Sanchez. And then in the 58th minute Mbeumo lofted a cross to the back post, where Pinnock arrived to head powerfully past Sanchez.
Brentford frustrated Chelsea for the rest of the match before grabbing a second goal in the sixth minute of stoppage time.With Chelsea goalkeeper Sanchez coming forward into the Bees' box for a corner, Brentford broke away and substitute Neal Maupay squared to Mbeumo to gift his team-mate an open goal.
Mbeumo has now scored or assisted five Premier League goals against Chelsea, more than he has against any other side in the competition.
Brentford climb to 10th, moving a point above Chelsea, who have lost their eighth home league match of 2023, their most in a calendar year since 1986.
Referee: Simon Hooper. Assistants: Adrian Holmes, Simon Long. Fourth official: Graham Scott. VAR: Craig Pawson. Assistant VAR: Darren Cann."	Team_7	Team_4	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_6 and Team_7 at Turf Moor.
Team_6 beat Team_12 in their previous Premier League match to secure their first top-flight win since gaining promotion from the Championship. Elijah Adebayo scored in the 84th minute to cancel out Lyle Foster’s opener, only for Jacob Bruun Larsen to curl in a superb winner 65 seconds later. Vincent Kompany’s men had lost five of their six games before their away victory, with their only point coming in a 1-1 draw against Team_16. Team_6 will be looking to secure back-to-back wins but must improve their form at Turf Moor. They have been defeated in all four of their home games this season; only four teams in top-flight history have ever lost their first five on home soil in a single campaign – Team_14 in 1930-31, Portsmouth in 2009-10, Bolton Wanderers in 2011-12 and Team_15 in 2018-19.
Team_7 have had an indifferent start to the campaign under new manager Mauricio Pochettino and are currently 11th in the Premier League with eight points in their seven matches. The Blues ended their three-game winless run with a comfortable 2-0 win over Team_10 in their last game, with their only other triumph in the top-flight coming against newly promoted Luton. They will be focusing on securing a place in European football next season but are currently five points behind Team_19, who are in seventh position. However, Team_7 will be confident that they can secure another win against Team_6 as they have been victorious in seven of their last eight fixtures at Turf Moor, drawing the other one. No team has played more away games against an opponent in the competition without losing.
Team_6 (4-3-3): James Trafford; Vitinho, Ameen Al Dakhil, Hannes Delcroix, Charlie Taylor; Sander Berge, Josh Cullen, Josh Brownhill; Wilson Odobert, Lyle Foster, Mike Tresor.
Team_6 SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Dara O’Shea, Jack Cork, Jay Rodriguez, Connor Roberts, Aaron Ramsey, Zeki Amdouni, Luca Koleosho, Jacob Bruun Larsen.
Team_7 (4-3-3): Robert Sanchez; Marc Cucurella, Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez; Cole Palmer, Armando Broja, Raheem Sterling.

Vitinho comes in at right-back and takes the place of Roberts. Tresor and Odobert start in the Premier League for the first time and appear on the wings, with Koleosho and Amdouni dropping into the bench.
Team_7 make one alteration to the team that beat Team_10 in their last match. Mudryk scored against the Cottagers but is replaced by Sterling. Jackson is back in the squad after his suspension for accumulating five yellow cards.
Team_6 manager Kompany could become the fourth manager to lose his first five Premier League home games in charge, after Mick McCarthy in 2003, Terry Connor in 2012 and Chris Ramsey in 2015. Kompany would be the first to do so from the start of a campaign. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get the game started.
Team_7 get this Premier League clash under way. Broja with the first pass of the game.
Sterling darts down the left and wins an early corner. However, Gallagher's inswinging cross is cleared out of the box. Palmer keeps the ball on the pitch, but he is tackled and Team_6 have possession.

Palmer drops deep to receive the ball in the middle of the pitch before curling a pass down the left to Colwill. He attempts to flash a low cross into the box, but Vitinho makes a crucial interception. The ball spins off him and bounces back to Trafford.
Team_6 are not putting Team_7 defence under any pressure and are letting them pass the ball from side to side. Disasi looks up and spots the run of Sterling, who rushes behind Team_6 defence, but the winger is unable to get it under control.
Palmer shows quick feet to roll past Odobert and move into space outside the box. He attempts to curl a shot across the goal and into the top corner, but his effort goes well over the target.

Team_7 have failed to win in their last 19 matches when conceding the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to 1st October 2022 against Team_8.
There has not been a lot of action since Team_6 netted the opener. Sterling has made a couple of surging runs down the left, but nothing has come from it. The away side are trying to target Vitinho.
CHANCE! Odobert moves down the left with the ball and cuts inside before clipping a cross into the heart of the box. Tresor gets there ahead of Colwill, but he is unable to direct his effort towards the goal.
Team_6 are playing their natural game and are not rushing in possession. They are allowing Team_7 to put them under pressure and are releasing the ball in the final moment before getting tackled.
Fernandez has the ball in the middle of the pitch and tries to chip a pass into the path of Palmer, who rushes inside from the right to try and get onto the end of it. However, Taylor gets across to shield it, allowing Trafford to come out and claim.
Cucurella is shown the first yellow card of the game for a swipe on Odobert, who jumped over his challenge before going to the floor.
Fernandez goes into the book a few seconds later after complaining about the decision. He is still talking to the referee alongside Gallagher.

Cullen is the first Team_6 player to be given a yellow card after pulling Sterling's shirt.
TACKLE! What a challenge from Cullen inside the box. Gallagher has the ball on the right and chips a cross into the box. It goes over the head of Broja but straight to Fernandez, who is unmarked. He takes a touch before Cullen slides across to concede a corner.

Team_6 have conceded four goals in the last 15 minutes of the first half, no team has conceded more in the Premier League this season.
Team_7 are patient with possession outside the box. Sterling then looks to chip a pass over the top of Team_6 defence and into the path of Broja, but he puts too much on it.
There will be three minutes of additional time. Team_7 have momentum in this game after scoring.
Silva is the third Team_7 player to be shown a yellow card after blocking the path of a Vitinho, who was breaking forward.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 1-1 Team_7
Team_6 scored with their only shot on target of the half but are heading into the break level with Team_7 after an own goal from Al Dakhil. The Blues dominated possession across the half but only had a couple of clear opportunities. Sterling whipped a shot just wide of the post before the hosts broke the deadlock. Foster dribbled through the middle of Silva and Disasi before finding Odobert inside the box. He drove his shot across the goal and into the bottom corner. Fernandez was denied a scoring chance after a phenomenal tackle from Cullen before Team_7 netted an equaliser. Sterling dribbled down the left and approached the byline before cutting a cross into the box, with the ball deflecting off Al Dakhil and into the net.
Team_6 showed defensive resilience before the break and are slightly unfortunate not to be leading. They defended their box brilliantly and stopped Team_7 from getting shots away from good positions. The Blues' only attempt on target came from Sterling, whose attempt from a narrow angle was never beating Trafford. They countered clinically but have not provided an attacking threat since scoring the opener. As for the away side, they have tried their best to remain patient. They have controlled possession and have shown flashes of quality but have not put Team_6 under pressure enough. Sterling has been one of their best players and has constantly looked to beat Vitinho.

93595	Chelsea	Newcastle	2024-03-11	Stamford Bridge, London	38752.0	John Brooks	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between Bournemouth and Sheffield United at the Vitality Stadium.
It is 13th against 20th in the Premier League. Bournemouth, who are 11 points clear of the relegation zone, will look to extend that gap and move closer to the top half with victory over their despondent opponents. Fresh from a 6-0 home drubbing by Arsenal, United are 11 points from safety, and must start to get wins on the board if they are to have any chance of completing a great escape.
BOURNEMOUTH (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Chris Mepham, Milos Kerkez; Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook; Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke.
SUBS: Mark Travers, Max Kinsey, Romain Faivre, Alex Scott, Philip Billing, Tyler Adams, Dango Ouattara, Luis Sinisterra, Enes Unal.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (3-5-2): Ivo Grbic; George Baldock, Jack Robinson, Auston Trusty; Jayden Bogle, Gustavo Hamer, Oliver Arblaster, Tom Davies, Ben Osborn; Ben Brereton, Oli McBurnie.
SUBS: Wes Foderingham, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Sam Curtis, Yasser Larouci, James McAtee, Andre Brooks, Oliver Norwood, Vinicius, William Osula.
After passing a late fitness test, Solanke starts for Bournemouth while Christie makes his 300th league appearance. Andoni Iraola makes a single change from last weekend's 2-0 win over Burnley - the Cherries' first Premier League victory of 2024 - with Mepham replacing the injured Marcos Senesi in the heart of defence. Adams is back on the bench for the hosts, though they continue to be without Max Aarons, Ryan Fredericks, Lloyd Kelly and James Hill.
Chris Wilder makes four changes in a desperate bid to stop United's rot. Baldock, Brereton and Osborn are all recalled, while there is a first Premier League start for 19-year-old Arblaster, as Ahmedhodzic, Norwood, Vinicius and McAtee drop to the bench. Mason Holgate completes his three-match suspension today, with Cameron Archer, John Egan, Max Lowe, Chris Basham, Rhian Brewster, Daniel Jebbison, Rhys Norrington-Davies and Anis Ben Slimane all missing out through injury.
Bournemouth have won two of their last three league meetings with United, more victories than they managed in the 16 previous encounters. Although, the Blades have only lost once in their last nine league visits to the Vitality Stadium.
The players make their way out onto the pitch. We are almost ready to go at the Vitality Stadium.
Anthony Taylor is our referee today. He blows his whistle and Bournemouth get us under way.
On the day of his 300th league appearance, Christie registers the first shot on goal. The midfielder catches his first long-range effort nicely, but it is straight at Grbic.
At the other end, Brereton has a sight on goal. However, he cannot generate enough power on his shot to test Neto.
On the road this season, United have just one win, five points, 10 defeats, 10 goals scored and 30 conceded. Those are all the worst such tallies in the Premier League.
Kerkez's cross deflects high into the air and Solanke challenges Grbic for the dropping ball. Thankfully for the United goalkeeper, it ricochets against the Bournemouth striker and behind for a goal kick.
Kerkez catches Davies late with a rash challenge. The United players are incensed with the Bournemouth full-back, who receives the first booking of the game.
Bournemouth are awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position after Osborn bundles Kluivert over. Tavernier goes across to take the set-piece near the right corner flag.
PENALTY TO BOURNEMOUTH! From the resulting free-kick, which Tavernier takes short into the area, Davies slides in and catches Solanke. The referee shows no hesitation and points straight to the spot.
Penalty Miss - Dominic Solanke
OH DEAR! WHAT A NIGHTMARE FOR SOLANKE! The Bournemouth number nine steps up to the spot, but slips at the vital moment and sends his penalty over the crossbar.
Smith is late on Brereton with his sliding challenge. He also goes into the book, meaning both Bournemouth full-backs are now on yellow cards.
United will have been relieved to see Solanke not convert the penalty. The Blades must now look to make the most of their good fortune.
Cook sends his corner delivery into the lesser-crowded section of the box at the near post. Semenyo meets it on the volley, but cannot quite keep his shot down.
The Cherries are unbeaten in each of their last seven Premier League matches against promoted sides, winning each of their four most recent such games.
We are still goalless at the midway point in the first half. Bournemouth have dominated possession, but registered just two shots on target so far.
GOOD SAVE! Semenyo arrives on the edge of the box to send a first-time shot towards goal. However, Grbic is alert and pushes it away.
HAMER!!! 1-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED! The visitors take the lead against the run of play! United embark on a swift counter with McBurnie and Hamer teeing up Bogle, whose shot from a tight angle is parried by Neto. Hamer is quickly onto the loose ball and buries the rebound into the roof of the net.
Smash and grab from the Blades. Despite enjoying just 29.8 per cent of the possession, they have taken their opportunity when it arrived. The Vitality Stadium is stunned.
SIDE-NETTING! Bournemouth look to respond and attack down the left wing. Christie collects the ball in the box and goes for goal from a tight angle but, off-balance, his strike goes the wrong side of the post.
At the other end, Hamer's cross from the left flank is met by McBurnie, but the Blades striker can only head straight at Neto.
McBurnie has not ended up on the winning side in any of his 15 Premier League appearances this season; more than any other player. Will the Blades striker enjoy better fortunes today?
Hamer unneccessarily takes out Smith and goes into the book for his troubles.
BRILLIANT SAVE! The Cherries push for the equaliser and Christie's cross is met by Semenyo at the near post. There is plenty of power in his header, but Grbic does well to tip it away.
Bournemouth continue to ask questions and Kluivert latches onto a ball beyond the United defence. Thankfully for the visitors, Grbic races out of goal to deny him a clear sight of goal.
The Blades' concentration levels are being tested to the maximum here. Solanke cushions Kerkez's cross for Christie on the edge of the box, but his first-time shot is always rising.
We are going to play four additional minutes at the end of this first half. There is still time for Bournemouth to respond before the break.
The Blades have a throw midway through stoppage time in the first half. They will likely send this long and would love to double their lead before the break.
FREE HEADER! Hamer's volley deflects behind for a corner. The subsequent delivery is met by McBurnie, but he cannot steer his header either side of Neto.
GOOD TRY! Bournemouth launch one last counter of the first half. Tavernier feeds Kerkez, who unleashes a fierce shot from a tight angle, and Grbic has to beat it away.
HALF-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 0-1 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Despite their turbulent recent form, Sheffield United lead 1-0 at the Vitality Stadium. Bournemouth made a dominant start to the contest, but could not capitalise as Dominic Solanke slipped at the vital moment and sent his 14th-minute penalty into the stands. Although, the Blades certainly made the most of that let-off and broke the deadlock in the 27th minute when Gustavo Hamer fired home from close range.
Bournemouth trail despite controlling large periods of the first half with 69.9 per cent of the possession, while they also recorded 316 passes compared to their opponents' 142. The Cherries have already have five shots on target, finding Grbic in decent form, but must keep asking questions upon the restart.
United make a change at the break with Vinicius replacing Davies, who conceded the first-half penalty.
Bournemouth also make a change as Ouattara replaces Kerkez.
United get the ball rolling again in the second half.
There is a brief concern for the visitors as Brereton stays down after blocking Smith's powerful drive. However, the striker is soon back on his feet.
Tavernier tees up Christie on the edge of the box. Although, like his first-half attempt from a similar position, his first-time shot is always rising.
Today, Bournemouth are in danger of losing three successive home games for the first time since 2019. Of course, the Cherries still have plenty of time on their side, though.
Ouattara looks to make an impact as he skips away from a challenge and crosses from the left flank. However, Grbic comfortably gathers.
United have conceded 72 goals in their first 27 Premier League games this season. That is the highest tally at this stage of a campaign in the top four divisions of English football since Doncaster Rovers in 1997-98 (73).
The Blades enjoy a rare venture forward in the second half. McBurnie looks to bend one in the top corner from the edge of the box, but there is just too much height on his effort.
Bournemouth appeal for a penalty as Kluivert goes to ground under pressure from Hamer. However, the referee is not interested.
McBurnie accidentally catches Mepham in the face with his trailing arm as they contest an aerial ball. The striker is quite unlucky to be shown a yellow card for that.
Iraola makes a double change in an attempt to rally Bournemouth. The first switch sees Unal introduced in place of Kluivert.
Sinisterra is also brought on in place of Tavernier.
SAVE! Arblaster looks to make his first Premier League start all the more memorable. The 19-year-old embarks on a strong run into the box, before unleashing a low drive that Grbic is forced to get down and turn away.
ROBINSON!!! 2-0 UNITED! The Blades double their lead! Bournemouth fail to deal with a corner as Neto punches the ball straight into Solanke's back. It ricochets to Robinson, whose shot crosses the line before it is clawed away. What a time to score his first Premier League goal!
SOLANKE SCORES! Bournemouth hit straight back and Sinisterra's strike is blocked by Robinson, but Solanke is first on the scene to prod the ball home. However, VAR are having a good look at this...
NO GOAL! The ball struck Solanke's arm before he poked it home. There was not much the Bournemouth striker could have done about it in all fairness. However, given the current interpretation of the laws, it is the right decision.
The visitors make a double change. The first of those sees McBurnie given a breather with McAtee taking his place.
Wilder also opts for an extra body in the heart of defence with Ahmedhodzic brought on to replace Bogle.
As things stand, United would move off the foot of the Premier League table with this scoreline. They would still be eight points from safety, but it would be a start for Wilder's side.
Grbic takes his time restarting the game from a goal-kick. He does so too much for the liking of the referee, who books him.
The hosts turn straight to the bench with Scott introduced in place of Smith.
Billing also comes on for the hosts with Christie making way.
OUATTARA!!! 2-1! BOURNEMOUTH PULL ONE BACK! The half-time substitute picks a good moment to score his first home Premier League goal. He is completely unmarked to meet Christie's corner at the near post, and plant a firm header past Grbic.
Christie delivered an inviting corner that was begging to be attacked, and Ouattara duly obliged.
United now face a huge test of their credentials inside the final quarter of an hour. The Blades have produced an impressive performance, but they will be desperate to ensure it is converted into maximum points.
Danger for the visitors as Bournemouth send another corner into the box. The ball ricochets towards goal, but Grbic gathers.
The visitors make two more changes. Brereton is replaced by Osula in one of them.
Arblaster's maiden Premier League start draws to a close. He is replaced by the more experienced Norwood, who was substituted early against Arsenal on Monday.
Yellow Card Benjamin Anthony Brereton Díaz
CHANCE! Ouattara is in there again for the hosts. This time, he meets a corner from the left flag, but cannot keep his header down on this occasion.
Bournemouth have really turned up the pressure since pulling a goal back. Indeed, they have enjoyed 83 per cent of possession in the last 10 minutes. Can United hold on?
Good block! Sinisterra leads Bournemouth's charge with a surging run into the box. He tees up Scott, whose first-time shot is deflected away by the United defence.
Mepham catches Hamer late and goes into the book.
Norwood also goes into the book for dissent.
Receiving the ball in space, Billing unleashes a fierce strike from distance. It is on target, but straight into the grateful arms of Grbic.
UNAL!!! BOURNEMOUTH EQUALISE! 2-2! United cannot hold on as their hosts complete the comeback. The visitors initally clear their lines, but Mepham helps the ball back into the danger zone. Ouattara flicks it on for Unal, who volleys home from close range.
Ouattara, who scored Bournemouth's first goal, claims an assist for their second after helping the ball on for Unal to finish.
We are almost halfway through eight additional minutes at the end of this game. Will Bournemouth go on and complete the turnaround?
The hosts push for a dramatic winner and Scott's cross deflects high into the air. However, Solanke is penalised for backing into Grbic.
JUST WIDE! Sinisterra almost wins it for Bournemouth. The substitute has been magnificent since coming on and embarks on another strong run into the area. He gets a shot away from a tight angle, but it drifts wide of the far post.
Sinisterra is involved again as he works his way into the box before teeing up Billing, whose first-time shot bends high and wide of the target.
FULL-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 2-2 SHEFFIELD UNITED
An entertaining game at the Vitality Stadium finishes all square with Bournemouth and Sheffield United sharing a 2-2 draw. After Dominic Solanke's missed penalty, Gustavo Hamer put the Blades ahead in the 27th minute. Jack Robinson doubled the lead after 64 minutes but United, who had an xG of 1.27 compared to their opponents' 2.65, could not hold on for all three points. Dango Ouattara pulled one back for the hosts 10 minutes later, before Enes Unal volleyed in the equaliser in the first minute of stoppage time to snatch a point. Despite failing to hang on, Chris Wilder's side move off the foot of the Premier League table, while Bournemouth remain 13th and 11 points clear of the relegation zone. The Cherries host Luton Town on Wednesday while United are not in action against until March 30, when they welcome Fulham to Bramall Lane. Thanks for joining us. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Cole Palmer starred with a goal and an assist as Chelsea beat Newcastle United 3-2 in a duel between two teams battling for European qualification.
The Chelsea midfielder’s first-half shot was flicked in by Nicolas Jackson and, although Alexander Isak equalised just before half-time, Palmer restored the hosts’ lead with a fierce second-half strike for his 11th Premier League goal of the season, before substitutes Mykhailo Mudryk and Jacob Murphy traded goals.
Palmer has now both scored and assisted in five top-flight matches this season, more than any other player.
While they still lie 11th, Chelsea have now taken eight points from a run of four unbeaten matches and are just one point behind Newcastle, while they are only four points behind seventh-placed West Ham United.
How the match unfolded
Mauricio Pochettino made two changes to the side that drew 2-2 against Brentford, with Raheem Sterling and Marc Cucurella replacing Ben Chilwell and Levi Colwill.
Newcastle also made two changes, Tino Livramento and Miguel Almiron replacing the injured Kieran Trippier and Harvey Barnes.
Chelsea made a dream start, scoring on six minutes for their earliest goal of the season and their fastest at home in the Premier League since December 2018 against Fulham.
Malo Gusto’s low cross forced a miscued clearance from Sven Botman and the ball fell kindly to Palmer, who unleashed a low strike from the edge of the box that was brilliantly flicked in by Nicolas Jackson for his ninth goal of the season. 
Chelsea looked comfortable and Newcastle suffered another blow in the 36th minute as Anthony Gordon limped off. But Pochettino’s side failed to press home their advantage and allowed their visitors to equalise with their first shot on target in the 43rd minute.
Chelsea lost the ball in midfield and Bruno Guimaraes found Isak, who placed a clinical side-footed finish into the bottom-right corner from the edge of the box for his 12th Premier League goal of the season, and his first ever in the competition from outside the penalty area.
Three minutes later Chelsea had the ball in the back of the net through Jackson, but the forward’s goal was ruled out for offside. Sterling also had a chance to restore Chelsea’s lead but his strike was comfortably saved by Martin Dubravka, while at the other end Joe Willock got in behind but was unable to finish.
Chelsea’s right-sided duo of Gusto and Palmer continued to cause Newcastle problems in the second half and looked the likeliest avenue for the Blues to get the winner.
Sure enough, in the 57th minute Palmer received Enzo Fernandez’s pass in the pocket outside the box and unleashed a wonderful strike into the bottom-right corner. It was Fernandez’s first assist in the Premier League this season.
Minutes later, a flick from Jackson played Sterling through on goal, but as the forward rounded Dubravka and shot, Dan Burn was there to clear the ball off the line.  
Burn had a chance to equalise as he headed wide from Almiron’s free-kick, but instead Chelsea made it 3-1 in the 75th minute.
Jackson drove from the halfway line and found Conor Gallagher, before substitute Mudryk took the ball off his team-mate and showed a moment of brilliance to nutmeg Fabian Schar before rounding Dubravka."	Team_7	Team_15	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_3 and Team_17 at the Vitality Stadium.
It is 13th against 20th in the Premier League. Team_3, who are 11 points clear of the relegation zone, will look to extend that gap and move closer to the top half with victory over their despondent opponents. Fresh from a 6-0 home drubbing by Team_1, United are 11 points from safety, and must start to get wins on the board if they are to have any chance of completing a great escape.
Team_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Chris Mepham, Milos Kerkez; Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook; Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke.
SUBS: Mark Travers, Max Kinsey, Romain Faivre, Alex Scott, Philip Billing, Tyler Adams, Dango Ouattara, Luis Sinisterra, Enes Unal.
Team_17 (3-5-2): Ivo Grbic; George Baldock, Jack Robinson, Auston Trusty; Jayden Bogle, Gustavo Hamer, Oliver Arblaster, Tom Davies, Ben Osborn; Ben Brereton, Oli McBurnie.
SUBS: Wes Foderingham, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Sam Curtis, Yasser Larouci, James McAtee, Andre Brooks, Oliver Norwood, Vinicius, William Osula.
After passing a late fitness test, Solanke starts for Team_3 while Christie makes his 300th league appearance. Andoni Iraola makes a single change from last weekend's 2-0 win over Team_6 - the Cherries' first Premier League victory of 2024 - with Mepham replacing the injured Marcos Senesi in the heart of defence. Adams is back on the bench for the hosts, though they continue to be without Max Aarons, Ryan Fredericks, Lloyd Kelly and James Hill.
Chris Wilder makes four changes in a desperate bid to stop United's rot. Baldock, Brereton and Osborn are all recalled, while there is a first Premier League start for 19-year-old Arblaster, as Ahmedhodzic, Norwood, Vinicius and McAtee drop to the bench. Mason Holgate completes his three-match suspension today, with Cameron Archer, John Egan, Max Lowe, Chris Basham, Rhian Brewster, Daniel Jebbison, Rhys Norrington-Davies and Anis Ben Slimane all missing out through injury.
Team_3 have won two of their last three league meetings with United, more victories than they managed in the 16 previous encounters. Although, the Blades have only lost once in their last nine league visits to the Vitality Stadium.
The players make their way out onto the pitch. We are almost ready to go at the Vitality Stadium.
Anthony Taylor is our referee today. He blows his whistle and Team_3 get us under way.
On the day of his 300th league appearance, Christie registers the first shot on goal. The midfielder catches his first long-range effort nicely, but it is straight at Grbic.
At the other end, Brereton has a sight on goal. However, he cannot generate enough power on his shot to test Neto.
On the road this season, United have just one win, five points, 10 defeats, 10 goals scored and 30 conceded. Those are all the worst such tallies in the Premier League.
Kerkez's cross deflects high into the air and Solanke challenges Grbic for the dropping ball. Thankfully for the United goalkeeper, it ricochets against the Team_3 striker and behind for a goal kick.
Kerkez catches Davies late with a rash challenge. The United players are incensed with the Team_3 full-back, who receives the first booking of the game.
Team_3 are awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position after Osborn bundles Kluivert over. Tavernier goes across to take the set-piece near the right corner flag.
PENALTY TO Team_3! From the resulting free-kick, which Tavernier takes short into the area, Davies slides in and catches Solanke. The referee shows no hesitation and points straight to the spot.
Penalty Miss - Dominic Solanke
OH DEAR! WHAT A NIGHTMARE FOR SOLANKE! The Team_3 number nine steps up to the spot, but slips at the vital moment and sends his penalty over the crossbar.
Smith is late on Brereton with his sliding challenge. He also goes into the book, meaning both Team_3 full-backs are now on yellow cards.
United will have been relieved to see Solanke not convert the penalty. The Blades must now look to make the most of their good fortune.
Cook sends his corner delivery into the lesser-crowded section of the box at the near post. Semenyo meets it on the volley, but cannot quite keep his shot down.
The Cherries are unbeaten in each of their last seven Premier League matches against promoted sides, winning each of their four most recent such games.
We are still goalless at the midway point in the first half. Team_3 have dominated possession, but registered just two shots on target so far.
GOOD SAVE! Semenyo arrives on the edge of the box to send a first-time shot towards goal. However, Grbic is alert and pushes it away.
HAMER!!! 1-0 Team_17! The visitors take the lead against the run of play! United embark on a swift counter with McBurnie and Hamer teeing up Bogle, whose shot from a tight angle is parried by Neto. Hamer is quickly onto the loose ball and buries the rebound into the roof of the net.
Smash and grab from the Blades. Despite enjoying just 29.8 per cent of the possession, they have taken their opportunity when it arrived. The Vitality Stadium is stunned.
SIDE-NETTING! Team_3 look to respond and attack down the left wing. Christie collects the ball in the box and goes for goal from a tight angle but, off-balance, his strike goes the wrong side of the post.

93446	Man City	Liverpool	2023-11-25	Etihad Stadium, Manchester	53289.0	Chris Kavanagh	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Everton and Brighton!
Everton are looking to continue their momentum after picking up three league wins in their last five games (L2). The Toffees defeated West Ham at the London Stadium last time out in the Premier League, before producing a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Burnley in the EFL Cup. Sean Dyche’s men are back at Goodison Park once again as they look to replicate a similar display against Brighton to the one we saw at the Amex Stadium last season, where the Toffees ran out 5-1 winners. Everton’s potential new owners, 777 Partners, have been spotted in the stands in recent weeks, and they’ll be hoping for another positive result today if they attend on Merseyside.
Brighton are going through a tricky spell in England’s top flight and have failed to win in their last four games (D2 L2). In their previous two away fixtures, the Seagulls have conceded eight goals, but they will be hoping to turn their form around today against an Everton side who have struggled this campaign for the most part. The distraction of playing in the Europa League has possibly hampered Roberto De Zerbi’s side's performances over the last few weeks, but it’s a good chance for them to put it right today.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ashley Young; Dwight McNeil, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner, Jack Harrison; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Arnaut Danjuma, Joao Virginia, Beto, Ben Godfrey, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Lewis Dobbin.
BRIGHTON (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Jan Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, Joel Veltman; Kaoru Mitoma, Billy Gilmour, James Milner, Simon Adingra; Adam Lallana, Pascal Gross; Evan Ferguson.
BRIGHTON SUBS: Tariq Lamptey, Igor Julio, Adam Webster, Mahmoud Dahoud, Joao Pedro, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Ansu Fati,  Facundo Buonanotte.
Dyche has made two changes from the side who defeated Burnley in the week. Amadou Onana misses out through injury, which is a huge loss for the Toffees after an impressive start to the season. Gueye is given a chance in the midfield to replace him, whilst Young also comes back into the team to replace Patterson after missing the game against West Ham through suspension.
De Zerbi has rolled the dice at Goodison Park, making five alterations from the side who drew at home to Fulham last time out. There’s a change between the sticks, with Verbruggen coming in for Steele. Brighton have also switched it up in defence, with Igor and Webster dropping out for van Hecke and Veltman. Dahoud and Baleba also find themselves on the bench, making way for Gilmour and Milner.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off. Before the game gets under way, there will be a period of silence for Remembrance Day.
Ferguson gets the game under way for Brighton at Goodison Park!
Brighton are sticking with their style of play which has brought them so much success under De Zerbi early stages, staying patient and keeping hold of the ball. The Toffees are happy to sit back and wait for an opening, being compact and organised.
A chance for Everton! Calvert-Lewin wins a flick-on after a long punt up the pitch by Pickford. It finds McNeil who works the ball onto his left and delivers into the penalty area. Brighton struggle to clear, and it falls to Doucoure who hits it on the volley, but it's straight at Verbruggen who palms it clear. Early danger for the Seagulls!
GOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-0 EVERTON!!!! The Toffees have started superbly. Calvert-Lewin and McNeil link up once again on the left-hand side, with the latter sending another cross into the box. Mykolenko burst into the penalty area from defence and gets on the end of it, before forcing a save from Verbruggen. The ball falls straight back into his path, and he fires it into the back of the net for his first goal of the season!
The Seagulls have reacted well to going a goal behind and are looking dangerous in the final third. Brighton attack at pace and the ball falls to Adingra on the edge of the box, but he drags his shot wide. Everton need to tighten up and stay composed to keep hold of their lead.
Brighton have enjoyed 89.8 per cent of the possession so far, but are struggling to break Everton down. The style of play is playing into Dyche's hands, with the former Burnley manager happy to have his side wait patiently without the ball and pounce when necessary.
Branthwaite gives away a foul on Adingra deep inside the Everton half and the Goodison Park faithful aren't happy. Brighton will have a chance to fill the box from a free-kick, with Gross standing over it.
GOOOAAAALLL!!! 1-1 BRIGHTON!! What a finish! Dunk peels off at the back post and volleys a superb strike into the back of the net. The delivery from Gross was inch-perfect. But hold on, VAR are checking it...
GOAL DISALLOWED!!! Dunk deserved to get himself on the scoresheet after volleying past Pickford, but he crept beyond the defensive line. After a short delay, the goal doesn't stand! The Brighton defender is denied his first goal of the season.
The Toffees are looking to hit Brighton on the counter at every opportunity. Doucoure breaks through the midfield and feeds Harrison on the right-hand side. His cross is delivered into the box and Calvert-Lewin attacks it from deep, but he's adjudged to have fouled his opponent.
Gilmour attempted to bring down Doucoure as Everton countered, but the referee played advantage. After play had stopped, the official hadn't forgotten the foul from the Brighton man and awarded a yellow.
Calvert-Lewin bursts through the middle and has a chance to drive into the penalty area. The Everton forward knocks the ball past Dunk and the Brighton defender brings him down. Doucoure is through on goal... but the referee doesn't play advantage! It's now a free-kick to the Toffees on the edge of the box.
Dunk goes into the book for his foul on Calvert-Lewin just a few yards outside the box.
Garner is standing over the free-kick... but he sends it over the bar and into the stands behind the goal. Brighton are enjoying more of the ball and working it well, but Everton are looking dangerous on the counter. De Zerbi's side have to become more compact in defence.
Mitoma receives the ball out wide and looks to take on Young. The Japanese winger darts past the Everton full-back and looks to beat Pickford to it after the goalkeeper rushes out of his goal. Mitoma gets a toe to the ball, but the Toffees keeper is able to gather it.
Everton look to break once again after Brighton enjoy another spell of possession. Calvert-Lewin leads the attack, driving through the centre of the pitch. He has Doucoure to his left, but chooses to go alone. The English striker shifts the ball onto his weaker foot, but he can only drag his shot wide of the post.
Dyche's side have managed just three touches inside the opposition box so far this game, but the Everton boss won't mind when he looks at the scoreboard. Two of those touches have come from Mykolenko, with his first shot saved by Verbruggen and his second flying into the back of the net.
It's a dangerous scoreline for Everton, with Brighton proving to be a threat in the final third. The Seagulls are struggling to create any clear-cut chances, but De Zerbi's side are working the ball well and causing the Toffees some problems.
Milner works the ball out wide to Mitoma and the Brighton winger once again looks to cause problems with his dribbling. However, Harrison is there to snuff out the danger. The Japanese international isn't having a lot of joy out wide as it stands, with Everton dealing with him well.
Everton earn themselves a breather as Mitoma fouls Harrison just inside the Everton half. It's a chance for the Toffees to fill the box and go direct. Pickford launches it towards Tarkowski, but it's a weak header from the defender and it goes behind for a goal-kick.
Despite Brighton enjoying more of the possession, Everton are the side who are creating the better chances. The Toffees have registered six shots so far this game, with Brighton only managing three. Dyche will be desperate for his team to grab a second as the first half reaches the final few minutes.
Gueye goes into the book after Everton had appealed for a penalty for a foul on McNeil. The referee wasn't happy with Gueye's reaction to the incident.
There will be four minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
The Toffees are happy to let Brighton continue to try and break them down in the final few minutes of the half. De Zerbi's side are struggling to find an opening, with Dyche's side remaining resolute. The Seagulls manager won't be happy with his team's performance in the opening 45 minutes.
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 1-0 BRIGHTON
Everton go into the break with a 1-0 lead over Brighton after opening the scoring early on. The Toffees found the back of the net through an unlikely scorer, with Mykolenko grabbing his first goal of the season, pouncing inside the box to force a save out of the keeper before slamming home the rebound. Shortly after, the Seagulls thought they’d equalised. Gross delivered a free-kick towards the far post and Dunk struck an unstoppable volley beyond Pickford. However, after a VAR check, the referee ruled the goal out for offside.
The Seagulls are struggling to turn their 83.2 per cent possession into chances. Brighton have created just 0.18 expected goals (xG) in the first half, testing Pickford with only one shot on target. Dyche has set his side up to stay compact and try and hit the opposition in transition, and it's working well so far. Everton have managed double the amount of shots that De Zerbi's side have, but it's going to be a tough second 45 minutes as Brighton search for an equaliser.
Everton get the second half under way!
De Zerbi makes a change at the break, and it's no surprise after a disappointing opening 45 minutes. Lallana is the one to make way, with Joao Pedro entering the fray.
The Seagulls have made a bright start to the second half as Mitoma bursts down the left before winning a corner. The Joao Pedro substitution could allow Brighton to be a little more creative in the final third, whilst also adding plenty of pace to their attack.
Gueye and Dunk have both made fouls in the opening stages of the second half. Their respective managers might be having words or considering a change, with both players already on a yellow. It was an aggressive affair in the first half and it appears to be no different after the break.
The Everton players aren't happy! Gilmour is played the ball between the lines and drives towards the penalty area. Tarkowski comes out of defence to make a tackle and appears to win the ball, but he also goes through the Brighton man and the referee awards a free-kick.
Doucoure is the latest player to go into the referee's book.
What a save! Dunk stands over the resulting free-kick and sends his shot towards the top corner. Pickford flies across his line and tips the ball over the bar. So close for Brighton, but the English goalkeeper was equal to it. Superb stop!
Everton have struggled to show any attacking intent since the second half got under way. Dyche's side are yet to touch the ball inside the opposition box. The Toffees were bound to sit back and continue to absorb the pressure, but the supporters at Goodison Park are desperate for a second goal!
The Toffees are defending well and Brighton are yet to find a breakthrough. Harrison's work rate to nullify the threat of Mitoma has been superb, as the Everton winger earns his side a free-kick and a few minutes of respite.
Garner gives away a foul inside the Everton half after a rough challenge on Mitoma. Replays show that the midfielder wins the ball, but the referee has clearly felt that it was a little too aggressive for his liking. Brighton have a chance to fill the box from a free-kick, but it comes to nothing.
Brighton are beginning to turn the screw and the Toffees' defensive structure is being tested. De Zerbi's side have only managed the one shot on target in the second half, through Dunk's free-kick, but it's going to be a long end to the game if Dyche's men continue to allow the Seagulls to get the ball into advanced areas.
Mitoma manages to get into a one-on-one situation with Young and darts past the Everton defender. He pulls the ball back towards the edge of the area where Gross is in space, but he gets his shot all wrong and it flies over the bar. It's a bit of a let-off for the Toffees, who can't allow Mitoma that much space out wide.
Ferguson has endured a difficult afternoon in attack for Brighton, and De Zerbi opts to make a change, with Fati entering the fray.
Gilmour was looking to start plenty of attacks from deep, making 16 passes into the final third. However, the Brighton manager feels it's time for a change, with Dahoud coming on in his place.
It's a chance for Joao Pedro as Brighton break the Everton press and Gross finds himself in space as he bursts towards the penalty area. He lays the ball to Joao Pedro inside the box, who swivels and shoots, but Tarkowski flings himself in front of it and makes the block. De Zerbi's side are beginning to exploit some gaps and are upping the tempo in the final third.
Everton's counter-attacking strategy isn't working as well as in the first half. The Toffees win the ball back deep inside their own half and Harrison plays a long hopeful pass beyond the Brighton defence, but it's too far for Calvert-Lewin who was chasing it down.
Chance for Everton! Harrison works the ball well on the right-hand side and closes in on the Brighton penalty area. McNeil is screaming for the pass in a central area, and he gets his wish before shifting the ball onto his left. The Toffees wide-man unleashes a low strike from the edge of the box, but it goes whistling past the post! So close to their second!
Joao Pedro plays a delightful flick into the path of Fati, but Branthwaite drags him to the floor and the referee brandishes a yellow.
Brighton apply the pressure from the resulting free-kick and after Everton initially clear, the ball falls to Mitoma unmarked in the box. The Seagulls winger fails to stay composed and skies his left-footed strike high and wide. The Japanese international really should have done better there, he will be disappointed.
It's an attacking change from De Zerbi, who is looking to throw the kitchen sink at it. Milner comes off in place of Buonanotte, who is in search of his first goal of the season.
Tarkowski makes a reckless challenge on Fati and the referee is quick to award him a yellow.
Everton are starting to show signs of fatigue as Brighton continue to push for an equaliser. Dyche is yet to make a change today, but his side could certainly do with some fresh legs.
GOOAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-1 BRIGHTON!! The Seagulls finally make their possession count. Mitoma receives a wonderful pass on the left-hand side and looks to take on Harrison. The Brighton winger creates spaces for himself and sends a cross into the box, but it deflects off Young and goes looping over Pickford and into the goal. It’s so unfortunate for the Toffees, but De Zerbi’s side have been dominant in the second half.
Everton are pushing to get back in front! Mykolenko and Harrison both test the Brighton defence with crosses into the box, but the Seagulls deal with the danger well. Shortly after, Doucoure bursts into the box and wins his side a corner. Dyche's side are showing some attacking intent after the equaliser.
It's a straight swap in defence as Patterson comes on in place of Young. The Scotland international will offer a little more pace and attacking threat.
It's a change in attack for Everton as Calvert-Lewin's game is over with Beto coming on in his place. The Portuguese forward is in search of his first ever Premier League goal.
De Zerbi is looking to tighten up his defence in the final few minutes, with Igor coming on for Adingra.
There will be four minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Dyche's side appear to be unsure whether to push for the winner or avoid conceding once again. A draw wouldn't be the worst result for Everton, but they were in the lead for the majority of the game. We're into the final few moments now.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 1-1 BRIGHTON
Brighton snatched a late draw at Goodison Park as Everton failed to hold on. Mykolenko opened the scoring for the Toffees with his first goal of the season, pouncing in the box to put his side ahead. Dyche's side sat deep and invited the pressure for the rest of the game, but the Seagulls eventually found a way through, as Young turned a Mitoma cross into his own goal. A heartbreaking moment for the Merseyside club who fought until the very end. Everton are in action next Saturday away to Crystal Palace as they hope to continue their impressive form. De Zerbi's side will be looking to end their winless run of five games when they host strugglers Sheffield United next time out in the Premier League. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Trent Alexander-Arnold's 80th-minute goal earned Liverpool a 1-1 draw at leaders Manchester City after Erling Haaland broke yet another record. 
It looked like Man City were heading four points clear at the top of the table thanks to Haaland's 50th Premier League goal, but Alexander-Arnold's superb strike means the Reds stay one point behind City, but drop a place to third following Arsenal's 1-0 win at Brentford.
City, whose 23-match winning home run in all competitions came to an end, fall to second, one point adrift of the Gunners.
How the match unfolded
Man City made one change to the team that drew 4-4 at Chelsea prior to the international break. Ederson was passed fit after pulling out of the Brazil squad, but Jack Grealish was absent due to illness. For Liverpool, Curtis Jones started in midfield, with Darwin Nunez and Diogo Jota accompaying Mohamed Salah in attack.
The first chance of the match came in the 11th minute, when Alisson's poor pass went straight to Phil Foden, whose strike at goal was weak and did not trouble the Liverpool goalkeeper.
Liverpool had the best chance of the opening exchanges, with Nunez's header from Salah's cross being tipped away by Ederson.
But that was Liverpool's only shot on target of the first half as Man City asserted their dominance, which they made count in the 27th minute after another Alisson error.
Alisson's sloppy kick was controlled by Nathan Ake, who skipped between two challenges and played in Haaland to score his historic 50th goal, reaching the milestone in his 48th appearance, smashing Andrew Cole's record.
It was the Norwegian's first Premier League goal against Liverpool, meaning he has now scored against 20 of the 21 opponents he's faced in the competition, failing only against Brentford, whom City next face in February.
Man City came close to doubling their lead in the last minute of the first half in a moment involving a moment of brilliance by both goalkeepers.
Ederson's long pass led to an opportunity for Foden to smash a shot at goal, which Alisson dived to his left to push wide of a post.
In the second half, City continued to look the more likely team to score, with Julian Alvarez lifting a shot over the bar and Ruben Dias having a goal ruled out after Manuel Akanji had fouled Alisson.
Liverpool also lost Diogo Jota to an apparent injury, with the Portuguese hobbling off before the hour mark.
But Jurgen Klopp's side refused to give up, and shortly after Nunez saw a shot saved at the near post, they equalised, and Alisson played a big part, making amends for his mistake that led to City's goal.
Alisson saved a close-range shot by Haaland and, less than a minute later, Salah passed to Alexander-Arnold, who produced a fantastic low finish from the edge of the box for his first goal of the Premier League season. 
Both teams wanted to find a winner, and Klopp tried to benefit from fresh legs as he made five substitutions.
Pep Guardiola in comparison made none, but despite that it was City who so nearly nicked a win at the death.
In the last minute of stoppage time, Alvarez's corner was headed across goal and inches wide by Haaland, as the latest instalment of Man City v Liverpool ended all square."	Team_13	Team_11	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_9 and Team_5!
Team_9 are looking to continue their momentum after picking up three league wins in their last five games (L2). The Toffees defeated Team_19 at the London Stadium last time out in the Premier League, before producing a comfortable 3-0 win at home to Team_6 in the EFL Cup. Sean Dyche’s men are back at Goodison Park once again as they look to replicate a similar display against Team_5 to the one we saw at the Amex Stadium last season, where the Toffees ran out 5-1 winners. Team_9’s potential new owners, 777 Partners, have been spotted in the stands in recent weeks, and they’ll be hoping for another positive result today if they attend on Merseyside.
Team_5 are going through a tricky spell in England’s top flight and have failed to win in their last four games (D2 L2). In their previous two away fixtures, the Seagulls have conceded eight goals, but they will be hoping to turn their form around today against an Team_9 side who have struggled this campaign for the most part. The distraction of playing in the Europa League has possibly hampered Roberto De Zerbi’s side's performances over the last few weeks, but it’s a good chance for them to put it right today.
Team_9 (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ashley Young; Dwight McNeil, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner, Jack Harrison; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
Team_9 SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Arnaut Danjuma, Joao Virginia, Beto, Ben Godfrey, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Lewis Dobbin.
Team_5 (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Jan Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, Joel Veltman; Kaoru Mitoma, Billy Gilmour, James Milner, Simon Adingra; Adam Lallana, Pascal Gross; Evan Ferguson.
Team_5 SUBS: Tariq Lamptey, Igor Julio, Adam Webster, Mahmoud Dahoud, Joao Pedro, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Ansu Fati,  Facundo Buonanotte.
Dyche has made two changes from the side who defeated Team_6 in the week. Amadou Onana misses out through injury, which is a huge loss for the Toffees after an impressive start to the season. Gueye is given a chance in the midfield to replace him, whilst Young also comes back into the team to replace Patterson after missing the game against Team_19 through suspension.
De Zerbi has rolled the dice at Goodison Park, making five alterations from the side who drew at home to Team_10 last time out. There’s a change between the sticks, with Verbruggen coming in for Steele. Team_5 have also switched it up in defence, with Igor and Webster dropping out for van Hecke and Veltman. Dahoud and Baleba also find themselves on the bench, making way for Gilmour and Milner.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off. Before the game gets under way, there will be a period of silence for Remembrance Day.
Ferguson gets the game under way for Team_5 at Goodison Park!
Team_5 are sticking with their style of play which has brought them so much success under De Zerbi early stages, staying patient and keeping hold of the ball. The Toffees are happy to sit back and wait for an opening, being compact and organised.
A chance for Team_9! Calvert-Lewin wins a flick-on after a long punt up the pitch by Pickford. It finds McNeil who works the ball onto his left and delivers into the penalty area. Team_5 struggle to clear, and it falls to Doucoure who hits it on the volley, but it's straight at Verbruggen who palms it clear. Early danger for the Seagulls!
GOOOAAAALLLLL!!!! 1-0 Team_9!!!! The Toffees have started superbly. Calvert-Lewin and McNeil link up once again on the left-hand side, with the latter sending another cross into the box. Mykolenko burst into the penalty area from defence and gets on the end of it, before forcing a save from Verbruggen. The ball falls straight back into his path, and he fires it into the back of the net for his first goal of the season!
The Seagulls have reacted well to going a goal behind and are looking dangerous in the final third. Team_5 attack at pace and the ball falls to Adingra on the edge of the box, but he drags his shot wide. Team_9 need to tighten up and stay composed to keep hold of their lead.
Team_5 have enjoyed 89.8 per cent of the possession so far, but are struggling to break Team_9 down. The style of play is playing into Dyche's hands, with the former Team_6 manager happy to have his side wait patiently without the ball and pounce when necessary.
Branthwaite gives away a foul on Adingra deep inside the Team_9 half and the Goodison Park faithful aren't happy. Team_5 will have a chance to fill the box from a free-kick, with Gross standing over it.
GOOOAAAALLL!!! 1-1 Team_5!! What a finish! Dunk peels off at the back post and volleys a superb strike into the back of the net. The delivery from Gross was inch-perfect. But hold on, VAR are checking it...
GOAL DISALLOWED!!! Dunk deserved to get himself on the scoresheet after volleying past Pickford, but he crept beyond the defensive line. After a short delay, the goal doesn't stand! The Team_5 defender is denied his first goal of the season.
The Toffees are looking to hit Team_5 on the counter at every opportunity. Doucoure breaks through the midfield and feeds Harrison on the right-hand side. His cross is delivered into the box and Calvert-Lewin attacks it from deep, but he's adjudged to have fouled his opponent.
Gilmour attempted to bring down Doucoure as Team_9 countered, but the referee played advantage. After play had stopped, the official hadn't forgotten the foul from the Team_5 man and awarded a yellow.
Calvert-Lewin bursts through the middle and has a chance to drive into the penalty area. The Team_9 forward knocks the ball past Dunk and the Team_5 defender brings him down. Doucoure is through on goal... but the referee doesn't play advantage! It's now a free-kick to the Toffees on the edge of the box.
Dunk goes into the book for his foul on Calvert-Lewin just a few yards outside the box.
Garner is standing over the free-kick... but he sends it over the bar and into the stands behind the goal. Team_5 are enjoying more of the ball and working it well, but Team_9 are looking dangerous on the counter. De Zerbi's side have to become more compact in defence.
Mitoma receives the ball out wide and looks to take on Young. The Japanese winger darts past the Team_9 full-back and looks to beat Pickford to it after the goalkeeper rushes out of his goal. Mitoma gets a toe to the ball, but the Toffees keeper is able to gather it.
Team_9 look to break once again after Team_5 enjoy another spell of possession. Calvert-Lewin leads the attack, driving through the centre of the pitch. He has Doucoure to his left, but chooses to go alone. The English striker shifts the ball onto his weaker foot, but he can only drag his shot wide of the post.
Dyche's side have managed just three touches inside the opposition box so far this game, but the Team_9 boss won't mind when he looks at the scoreboard. Two of those touches have come from Mykolenko, with his first shot saved by Verbruggen and his second flying into the back of the net.
It's a dangerous scoreline for Team_9, with Team_5 proving to be a threat in the final third. The Seagulls are struggling to create any clear-cut chances, but De Zerbi's side are working the ball well and causing the Toffees some problems.
Milner works the ball out wide to Mitoma and the Team_5 winger once again looks to cause problems with his dribbling. However, Harrison is there to snuff out the danger. The Japanese international isn't having a lot of joy out wide as it stands, with Team_9 dealing with him well.
Team_9 earn themselves a breather as Mitoma fouls Harrison just inside the Team_9 half. It's a chance for the Toffees to fill the box and go direct. Pickford launches it towards Tarkowski, but it's a weak header from the defender and it goes behind for a goal-kick.
Despite Team_5 enjoying more of the possession, Team_9 are the side who are creating the better chances. The Toffees have registered six shots so far this game, with Team_5 only managing three. Dyche will be desperate for his team to grab a second as the first half reaches the final few minutes.
Gueye goes into the book after Team_9 had appealed for a penalty for a foul on McNeil. The referee wasn't happy with Gueye's reaction to the incident.
There will be four minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
The Toffees are happy to let Team_5 continue to try and break them down in the final few minutes of the half. De Zerbi's side are struggling to find an opening, with Dyche's side remaining resolute. The Seagulls manager won't be happy with his team's performance in the opening 45 minutes.
HALF-TIME: Team_9 1-0 Team_5
Team_9 go into the break with a 1-0 lead over Team_5 after opening the scoring early on.

Dyche has set his side up to stay compact and try and hit the opposition in transition, and it's working well so far. Team_9 have managed double the amount of shots that De Zerbi's side have, but it's going to be a tough second 45 minutes as Team_5 search for an equaliser.
Team_9 get the second half under way!
De Zerbi makes a change at the break, and it's no surprise after a disappointing opening 45 minutes. Lallana is the one to make way, with Joao Pedro entering the fray.

Ferguson has endured a difficult afternoon in attack for Team_5, and De Zerbi opts to make a change, with Fati entering the fray.

Shortly after, Doucoure bursts into the box and wins his side a corner. Dyche's side are showing some attacking intent after the equaliser.
It's a straight swap in defence as Patterson comes on in place of Young. The Scotland international will offer a little more pace and attacking threat.
It's a change in attack for Team_9 as Calvert-Lewin's game is over with Beto coming on in his place. The Portuguese forward is in search of his first ever Premier League goal.
De Zerbi is looking to tighten up his defence in the final few minutes, with Igor coming on for Adingra.
There will be four minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Dyche's side appear to be unsure whether to push for the winner or avoid conceding once again. A draw wouldn't be the worst result for Team_9, but they were in the lead for the majority of the game. We're into the final few moments now.
FULL-TIME: Team_9 1-1 Team_5
Team_5 snatched a late draw at Goodison Park as Team_9 failed to hold on. Mykolenko opened the scoring for the Toffees with his first goal of the season, pouncing in the box to put his side ahead. Dyche's side sat deep and invited the pressure for the rest of the game, but the Seagulls eventually found a way through, as Young turned a Mitoma cross into his own goal. A heartbreaking moment for the Merseyside club who fought until the very end. Team_9 are in action next Saturday away to Team_8 as they hope to continue their impressive form. De Zerbi's side will be looking to end their winless run of five games when they host strugglers Team_17 next time out in the Premier League. That's all for today, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93628	Liverpool	Sheffield Utd	2024-04-04	Anfield, Liverpool	60055.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of this Premier League fixture between Bournemouth and Crystal Palace.
Bournemouth will enter the game at the Vitality Stadium full of confidence as they look to extend their unbeaten run to five games. The Cherries will be confident of their Premier League status following their 2-1 win at the weekend against relegation candidates Everton. And having won the reverse fixture 2-0 at Selhurst Park, Andoni Iraola will be looking to lead his Bournemouth side to a league double over the Eagles.
Crystal Palace are in contrasting form to their hosts as they are winless in their last three games. Oliver Glasner seemingly had an immediate impact when he joined the club in late February, guiding the Eagles to a 3-0 victory over Burnley in his first match, but the Austrian has failed to win with the London club and will be hoping their fortunes change tonight with a victory over Bournemouth before they face Manchester City and Liverpool in their next two fixtures after tonight.

Bournemouth will again be without the services of Ryan Fredericks, Luis Sinisterra and Marcos Senesi for the contest due to injury problems, while Ryan Christie remains unavailable due to a knock. The Cherries did not pick up any fresh fitness issues against Everton. But there is change at left-back, as Lloyd Kelly provided the assist for Solanke to make the breakthrough on Saturday, has now come into the side.
As for Palace, Sam Johnstone, Cheick Doucoure, Rob Holding, Marc Guehi, Matheus Franca and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi will again be on the sidelines through injury, while the match has come too soon for Michael Olise, but the attacker is close to making his return. Joel Ward is making his 300th appearance for Crystal Palace in the Premier Leaue this evening and will provide that valuable experience beside the excellent Adam Wharton, a player that has excelled since coming into the side from Blackburn Rovers in January, and he will again feature in the middle of the park.
The teams are lined out on the pitch and the game will soon get underway. This promises to be an entertaining affair.
KICK-OFF! Crystal Palace get the game underway here at the Vitality Stadium.
An early chance to get the ball into a dangerous area with a free-kick for Crystal Palace. Eze swung the ball into the box but it was easily cleared by Bournemouth. Danger cleared.
The game has been slow to get underway, and this has not been helped by the stoppage in play for Dango to get treatment on the sideline from the Bournemouth physios.
Neither side has been able to control possession in any meaningful way so far, with the match resembling a game of hot potato in these early minutes.
The Cherries swing in the corner but after it is knocked about without any real threat in the box the ball finds its way harmlessly into the arms of Henderson.
Both sides are looking to press and win the ball back whenever they can. This is hampering the two sides building up their control of the ball and the chances they have to create opportunities. Both sides are looking to ensure their opponent has no time to think on the ball and select the correct option.
Silly foul by Smith on Eze as the Bournemouth press looked to win the ball high up the pitch with the midfielder running down a blind alley.
Fantastic play down the wing by in-form striker Solanke. You can tell he is a man confident in his ability at the moment as he used his pace to burst down the wing and skip past the Palace defence before looking to play in his team-mate but the move broke down with good defending from the visitors. Solanke looks in the mood to add to his 16 Premier League goals this season tonight.
Bournemouth are starting to dictate proceedings and are looking the more dangerous of the two sides. Limiting Palace to counter attacks. The Cherries have just failed on their final pass but they feel a chance to take the lead is coming.
Worrying for Palace as Eze is down getting treatment. Maybe it is due to the Palace fans belting out 'Eze's on fire' or the injury was just a tactical relief of pressure. But he looks fit to continue.
A fiercely contested game to this point in the middle third of the pitch but nothing in the way of chances so far. Only one attempt in the whole game to this point. A blocked down Christie shot that was then cleared from the edge of the box by Palace. Once either side finds their edge in the final third a goal will soon follow.
Hughes is key to the transitional play and keeping the momentum in the Palace team as he has made 23 passes so far, with 17 of them finding their target. More than any other player for the visitors.
Hughes once key to Palace. As his pressure won the ball on the edge of the Bournemouth penalty area. He nicked the ball away from Scott, with the ball falling the way of Eze. He moved it swiftly to Mateta. But the striker could not add the finish to open the scoring as Neto saved. Great pressing.
The match has truly come to life now. This time a missed opportunity from Biling. The midfielder flashed his effort wide across the face of goal. After collecting the ball on the halfway line he drove to the opposition box before playing a one-two with Dango. And he swiftly fired towards goal but Palace will be thankful he could not find the net with his effort.
The Palace fans have not let up in the noise they have created for their the travelling team. And at times their small pocket of support are over powering the noise of the home support.
Excellent defending from Zabarnyi. The Ukranian defender got his body across Eze on the six-yard box to deny the Eagles player a chance at goal with the ball rolling to the grateful hands of Neto. Cook will be the most thankful player though as it was he that lost the ball under pressure on the edge of the penalty area to Eze to present the chance to Palace. But they got away with that one.
Andersen going into the book for a foul midway in his half.
WHAT A SAVE! Henderson keeps the game level. Biling will be wondering how he did not give Bournemouth the lead. The midfielder rose highest to connect perfectly with the cross from Smith, but his effort was tipped over by Henderson for a croner. Bournemouth are looking likely to go ahead.
SO CLOSE! Kelly puts his header centimetres wide of the post from the corner. The left back connected with the cross from the corner but he could not control it into the net and it went just wide. Palace are living on the edge with the Cherries seemingly determined to enter the break in the lead.
Andersen with another foul. He will need to be careful. He is already in a yellow.
A clumsy foul on the edge of the penalty area by Mateta on Scott. A very dangerous position for the free-kick.
Andersen is getting a stern talking to for something he did off the ball that the referee did not like. The centre back has been given what looks like his final warning.
Biling drove the ball straight into the wall. Wasted chance just before the interval. And as the ball made its way to Christie out wide his ball back into the box was poor and straight into the arms of Henderson.
Eze thought he had given Palace the lead against the run of play. The ball was played up to Mateta. The striker held the ball up on the edge of the penalty area before playing it wide to Ayew. The ball was played across the box to Eze after poor defending failed to clear the ball. A great finish followed to give the Eagles the lead. But in the build-up Mateta was offside as he collected the ball forward. Meaning the goal was ruled out for offside and it remains level.
HALF-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 0-0 CRYSTAL PALACE
A thoroughly entertaining 0-0 to this point despite the majority of the half seeing no chances. But as we moved past the half hour mark the game came to life as first Mateta squandered a glorious chance following excellent pressing by Hughes on the edge of the area, only for the French striker to fire at Neto. Moments later, Biling flashed the ball across the Palace net. Biling once again had the opportunity to give the lead to Bournemouth as he connected superbly with a Smith cross, but the fantastic reflexes of Henderson denied him giving the Cherries the lead. From the resultant corner Kelly should have given Iraola's side the lead but he sent it narrowly wide. But against the run of play Palace thought they had gone into the half time break leading from an Eze strike but it was ruled out by an offside in the build up from Mateta. Everything is pointing to a Bournemouth win, as the south coast side have created more chances and better chances as displayed in their xG of 0.6 compared to Palace's xG of 0.1. The game has been a fascinating contest and the possession has not demonstrated the dominance of the home side as they have managed only 53 per cent of the ball compared to Palace's 47 per cent. But as the game started to come to life the half time whistle went.
Palace need to keep their defensive effort up as they have limited Bournemouth quite well apart from the two balls into the box from wide. Should they prevent the ball being swung into the box they could leave the Vitality with a result as the hosts seem unable to deal with the counter attacking ability of the Eagles, demonstrated in their offside goal. This second half should be an intriguing tactical battle, but a thoroughly enjoyable one.
Scott has been replaced by Semenyo at half time.
KICK-OFF! Bournemouth get us back underway.
Palace have come out with intent this second half, building on the ending to their first half.
The opening five minutes of the second half has been all Palace so far. Bournemouth are struggling to get out of their half. A complete contrast to the first half performance from both sides.
Bournemouth swing in a free-kick from wide. The ball in is wicked but Palace deal with the ball, before a poor touch from Semenyo relieves the pressure on the Eagles.
The early second half pressure from Crystal Palace has briefly died down as Bournemouth have started to wrestle back control of possession.
The Palace faithful are making it known this attacking style is more of the type of football they expect to see as the visitors continue to search for the opening goal of the game.
Hughes goes into the referee's notebook for a cynical foul.
Wharton has been fantastic once again for Palace. The young midfielder so far has a passing accuracy of 90.3 per cent, as 28 of his 31 passes have been successful. And he has been great defensively winning the ball back with two interceptions and one tackle.
Tavernier with a cynical foul on Ayew denying a counter attack for Palace.
 Dango has been replaced by Kerkez.
 Billing has been replaced by Kluivert as Bournemouth look to find the opener.
A long range effort from Kerkez tested Henderson due to the ball skidding along the surface. The goalkeeper parried the ball into the onrushing Solanke, but the striker could not find the finish. Henderson can count himself lucky for not dealing with the first effort correctly.
Semenyo booked for a mistimed tackle.
Palace win their first corner of the game. Conversely Bournemouth have won five corners to this point of the tie.
Hughes has been replaced by Ozoh
Ayew has been replaced by the lively Schlupp
Despite a much stronger showing in this second half from the visitors they have yet to have an attempt at the Bournemouth goal in this half.
Both sides are lacking that final third quality to get that opening goal. As demonstrated by both sides failing to make simple passes as they moved forward in quick succession.
Ward showing all the experience a player that has made 300 Premier League appearances. He stopped Kluivert from launching a counter attack with a superb tackle, which then launched a Palace attack.
GOAL! Bournemouth get their reward for their dominance as they lead 1-0. Kluivert blasted the ball home after it was excellently squared from wide by Semenyo. The winger demonstrated his pace as he ran onto a ball behind the Palace defence before playing the ball to the penalty spot to Kluivert, and the Dutchman applied the finish for the Cherries, while getting his fifth Premier League goal of the season.
Semenyo ran onto a ball over the top. The rapid winger ran past Mitchel to get on the ball before passing it to Kluivert on the penalty spot. The Dutchman took one touch before firing the ball past Neto.
Bournemouth are really increasing the pressure on Palace as they try and finish the game and put it beyond Palace's reach. They sense weakness in the Eagles now they have taken the lead. Forcing Henderson to make a save to keep the ball out of the net and keep Palace in the contest.
Wharton has been replaced by Edouard as they go in search of an equaliser.
Calls for a Penalty! The Eagles are protesting for a spot kick. As Schlupp went to strike the ball but was kicked by the Bournemouth defender. The player went down and the Eagle's players are asking the referee to point to the spot. VAR checked the incident, but it was determined the referee's on field decision was correct.
Solanke has been replaced by Unal and the English striker will not add to his tally of 16 Premier League goals.
Smith has been replaced by  Aarons.
Eze went down under another challenge in the Bournemouth box, and once again the Eagle's players were calling for a penalty. But nothing was given again.
Henderson with a fantastic save to keep the visitors in the tie. Kluivert cut inside onto his right foot near the edge of penalty area and struck towards goal. But he was not able to double his tally or the lead.
Yellow Card Lloyd Casius Kelly
Palace are throwing everything at the Bournemouth goal as the time edges closer to the final whistle.
Semenyo has been phenomenal since his introduction at half time. And his toying of the Palace defence while holding possession in the corner of the pitch demonstrated this, the winger was the game changer having earned the assist for the goal.
FULL-TIME! Bournemouth 1-0 CRYSTAL PALACE
Bournemouth ran out 1-0 winners over Crystal Palace in this Premier League tie. Kluivert’s winning strike stretches their unbeaten run to five games, while it condemned Palace to their fourth game without a win. Iraola’s side took control of proceedings midway through the first half. The Cherries should have entered the break in the lead but for a superb Henderson save from a Biling header and Kelly failing to get his header in target. While only for Mateta being in an offside position in the build up to an Eze goal on the stroke of half time Palace would have entered the interval in front against the run of play. Both sides struggled to create chances in the second half before the deadlock was broken in the 79th minute by a Kluivert strike. Semenyo proved to be the difference as he was a dangerous weapon utilised expertly in the Bournemouth attack, getting the assist for the goal. Bournemouth truly deserved their victory as they limited Palace to only three attempts all game, the lowest they have had in the Premier League all season, while they had 11 attempts. And this dominance was also felt in the xG of Bournemouth as they had an xG of 1.22 compared to the Eagle’s xG of 0.11. Palace now have a tricky fixture against Manchester City next while Bournemouth will look to continue their impressive form against Luton Town."	"Liverpool returned to the top of the Premier League table with a hard-earned 3-1 victory over bottom side Sheffield United, leapfrogging Arsenal to go two points clear at the summit with eight matches left to play.
Alexis Mac Allister’s 20-yard thunderbolt 14 minutes from time helped to secure all three points at Anfield in a Thursday night contest that proved to be much more difficult for the hosts than most had expected.

A Conor Bradley own goal had cancelled out Darwin Nunez’s fortuitous first-half strike before Mac Allister produced a moment of magic for Jurgen Klopp’s side.
Substitute Cody Gakpo then wrapped up a crucial victory with a 90th-minute goal.
How the match unfolded
Liverpool were given a scare after just 31 seconds when Anel Ahmedhodzic flicked on Jack Robinson’s long throw towards the unmarked James McAtee, but the Manchester City loanee shot straight at Caoimhin Kelleher.

The hosts took advantage of their reprieve and took the lead in fortuitous circumstances after 17 minutes. Ivo Grbic’s attempted long kick was charged down by Nunez, who diverted the ball beyond the Blades goalkeeper and into the empty net.
Klopp’s side threatened a second goal before the break. Joe Gomez, Mac Allister and Luis Diaz all fired narrowly wide from long range, while Grbic pushed away Dominik Szoboszlai’s fierce drive before Kelleher kept out Jayden Bogle at the other end.

There was also an element of good fortune as the visitors snatched an equaliser 13 minutes into the second half, with Bradley deflecting Gustavo Hamer’s header through Kelleher’s legs.
Grbic saved Virgil van Dijk’s header while substitute Andrew Robertson fired a Harvey Elliott cross wide as Liverpool looked to regain the lead.

They moved ahead in spectacular fashion as Robertson’s cross ricocheted kindly for Mac Allister, who arrowed a 20-yard rocket into Grbic’s top-left corner.
Mac Allister went close again as his free-kick rattled the crossbar soon after, but it was Gakpo who sealed the points when he drifted into the area unmarked to nod home Robertson's deep cross.
Liverpool controlled large periods of the first half, with five of their players completing more passes than Sheff Utd as a whole. The Reds enjoyed 83.1% possession, the most recorded by any Premier League team in a single match since Opta records began in the 2003/04 season.
Nunez’s good fortune for the opener continued his positive start to 2024. The Uruguay international has now been directly involved in 15 goals in the calendar year across all competitions (10 goals, five assists); more than any other Premier League player.
However, the Reds were made to pay for not extending their advantage when in the ascendancy, as Bradley turned Hamer’s header past Kelleher.
Nevertheless, there was always hope for the side that has scored the most goals in the last 15 minutes this season (26).
Mac Allister’s thumping strike means he has now scored or assisted in eight of his last nine Liverpool starts, while Gakpo’s header put the contest to bed and keeps Liverpool in the driving seat in their title pursuit.
It was always going to be a tough ask for Chris Wilder’s side, as the Blades arrived at Anfield having lost 10 of their 12 previous league visits, with the sole victory during that span coming 30 years ago."	Team_11		"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of this Premier League fixture between Team_3 and Team_8.
Team_3 will enter the game at the Vitality Stadium full of confidence as they look to extend their unbeaten run to five games. The Cherries will be confident of their Premier League status following their 2-1 win at the weekend against relegation candidates Team_9. And having won the reverse fixture 2-0 at Selhurst Park, Andoni Iraola will be looking to lead his Team_3 side to a league double over the Eagles.
Team_8 are in contrasting form to their hosts as they are winless in their last three games. Oliver Glasner seemingly had an immediate impact when he joined the club in late February, guiding the Eagles to a 3-0 victory over Team_6 in his first match, but the Austrian has failed to win with the London club and will be hoping their fortunes change tonight with a victory over Team_3 before they face Team_13 and Team_11 in their next two fixtures after tonight.
Team_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Dango Ouattara, Lloyd Kelly, Illia Zabarnyi, Adam Smith; Lewis Cook, Philip Billing, Ryan Christie, Alex Scott, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke

Team_8 SUBS: James Tomkins, Jeffrey Schlupp, Nathaniel Clyne, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Remi Matthews, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh-Chibueze, Roshaun Mathurin
Team_3 will again be without the services of Ryan Fredericks, Luis Sinisterra and Marcos Senesi for the contest due to injury problems, while Ryan Christie remains unavailable due to a knock. The Cherries did not pick up any fresh fitness issues against Team_9. But there is change at left-back, as Lloyd Kelly provided the assist for Solanke to make the breakthrough on Saturday, has now come into the side.
As for Palace, Sam Johnstone, Cheick Doucoure, Rob Holding, Marc Guehi, Matheus Franca and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi will again be on the sidelines through injury, while the match has come too soon for Michael Olise, but the attacker is close to making his return.

93410	Spurs	Fulham	2023-10-23	Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London	61286.0	Anthony Taylor	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Arsenal and Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium.
Arsenal crushed Bournemouth 4-0 on the road in their last league outing and remain in the hunt at the top of the table. Pep Guardiola's side pipped the Gunners to the Premier League title last season, with this fixture offering Mikel Arteta's men the chance to inflict an early blow in what could be another closely contested fight for the top-flight crown. The hosts were undone in midweek by Lens in a 2-1 Champions League defeat, however.
City were shocked in their last league clash as the reigning English champions – and winners of the treble last season – fell to a surprise 2-1 defeat at Wolves. Guardiola's side responded in midweek with a 3-1 Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. However, Arsenal are unbeaten in the top flight as the first real test of City's latest Premier League title defence awaits.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, Declan Rice; Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah, Leandro Trossard.
SUBSTITUTES: Aaron Ramsdale, Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe, Gabriel Martinelli, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson, Kai Havertz.
MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol; Rico Lewis, Mateo Kovacic; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland.
SUBSTITUTES: Stefan Ortega, Kalvin Phillips, John Stones, Jack Grealish, Jeremy Doku, Sergio Gomez, Manuel Akanji, Matheus Nunes, Oscar Bobb.
Arteta makes three changes from the defeat to Lens. The headline news is that Bukayo Saka will miss a Premier League game for Arsenal for the first time since May 2021, ending an 87-match run of consecutive league appearances, due to injury. Nketiah takes his place, while White and Jorginho come in for Tomiyasu and Havertz, who both drop to the bench. Encouragingly, Martinelli is fit enough to be named as a substitute after recovering from injury.
Guardiola opts for three alterations to his last starting lineup at Leipzig. Akanji is replaced by Ake, while Rodri is still suspended so Kovacic starts alongside Lewis. The other change sees Alvarez get the nod ahead of Grealish, as Foden and Silva partner the Argentina forward in behind talisman Haaland.
Arsenal have lost their last 12 Premier League games against City, scoring just five times and conceding 33 against them in that time. It is their longest-ever losing run against an opponent in their league history. The Gunners are out to amend that poor record, as kick-off is approaching and the players are making their way onto the pitch!
Referee Michael Oliver gets this Premier League clash under way!
Ederson immediately launches long for Haaland, who is guarded away from the steepling ball by Saliba and Gabriel. Raya goes direct from his own goal-kick, and it appears Silva is playing behind Lewis and Kovacic, with Alvarez on the right-hand side rather than through the middle.
Silva continues to keep City's possession-focused play ticking, dropping deep in between the lines to work the ball from one side of the pitch to the other. Guardiola has effectively placed all of his trust in the Portugal international, who has been enlisted to recreate the suspended Rodri's role.
OFF THE LINE AND OVER! A first corner of the game comes on the right flank for City as Zinchenko cannot keep it in play. Foden sends it towards the far post, where Gvardiol volleys towards the bottom-right corner before Rice heads away on the line. The visitors recycle possession as Ake sneaks in behind but he powers over when one-on-one with Raya inside the area.
Ake will still be thinking he could well have done better with that early chance. Saliba recovered to put some pressure on the City centre-back but the Netherlands defender should have at least hit the target with the point-blank opportunity.
Arteta's hosts have rarely had their chance on the ball in the opening stages, although a crunching Jesus sliding tackle gets the home crowd excited. Saliba then does excellently to dispossess Haaland, which only further enthuses the Arsenal supporters.
Trossard launches a diagonal pass to Jesus, who drives infield from the right before winning Arsenal's first corner off Gvardiol. Captain Odegaard whips the delivery towards the near post but Nketiah fails to test Ederson with his attempted flick-on.
Foden powers away from Jorginho down the left-hand side before the Arsenal midfielder drags him down from behind. The Italy international is deservedly shown the first yellow card of the match.
The Gunners have settled slightly but are yet to truly impose any sort of authority on an otherwise quiet opening to this game. Guardiola's visitors are content to work their passes methodically as well, but they come unstuck when Kovacic can only play into the feet of Raya.
Foden waves his arms in the air when Dias' long pass sails harmlessly into the hands of Raya, who rushes out to roll the ball down the left flank. The Gunners' goalkeeper has been quick to intervene any time City look to punish Arsenal in behind.
Haaland – who was involved in four of City's seven league goals against Arsenal last season – has scored in each of his last four Premier League appearances in London. The only player to score five in a row in the capital (for a team outside of London) is Ruud van Nistelrooy, who did so between September 2002 and September 2003. The Norway striker has barely had a touch here so far, though.
CLOSE! Raya almost makes a terrible mistake to gift City the lead. The Arsenal goalkeeper takes an age over a long kick near his own line, smashing the ball into the onrushing Alvarez. Fortunately for the Gunners, the deflection cannons just wide to the right of goal.
Raya appears to have gestured to the home supporters to liven up after his error almost cost the Gunners a heavy price. The Arsenal goalkeeper made a similar mistake in midweek against Lens, so he may have that on his mind.
There is a brief scare for Arteta's side as Walker hoists long over the top for Foden, whose touch goes amiss and Raya speeds out to intervene. The home supporters are starting to get slightly wound up.
Silva hacks Nketiah down with a needless sliding tackle and becomes the first City name in referee Oliver's book.
Raya causes more issues as another poor pass sees Kovacic afforded the chance to dispossess Rice. Arsenal are dancing on a fine tightrope and must be careful when insisting to play out from the back.
Jesus thinks he has powered in behind to the right of goal but the Brazil striker is penalised for a nudge in Foden's back. The Gunners' attacker did not need to make contact with the England international there.
WIDE! Zinchenko clips down the inside left-hand channel for Nketiah as Dias fails to clear. The Arsenal striker dances inside onto his right foot but slashes a curling attempt wide to Ederson's left. A first opportunity goes begging for the hosts.
Kovacic is the next City player to go into the referee’s book after crunching through the back of Odegaard with a poor sliding tackle. The VAR has a check to see if the punishment should be upgraded to a red card, but the officials stick with the on-pitch call.
Kovacic is perhaps slightly fortunate to escape further punishment for a clumsy and overly aggressive smash into Odegaard's ankle. The VAR took some time considering the tackle before concurring with referee Oliver's original on-field decision.
Gvardiol sends Jesus spiralling to the floor after lunging into the Brazil international, who goes down and wins a wide free-kick. Tensions are rising in north London!
Odegaard and Trossard stutter over the free-kick before the former whips it towards the near post. Ederson claims above numerous bodies inside his six-yard area but has to parry down and collect on his second attempt to avoid any mistake.
OVER! Haaland gets involved for a rare instance, bringing down Ederson's long pass before offloading to Alvarez. The Argentina forward unleashes a right-footed drive from outside the area that is always travelling well over Raya's goal.
HOW IS HE NOT OFF? Kovacic lunges into Rice with another late sliding tackle but somehow referee Oliver does not further punish the Croatia midfielder, despite blowing for an Arsenal free-kick. City can feel incredibly fortunate to still have 11 players on the pitch.
Gvardiol concedes a corner on the right-hand side after Jesus battles to win possession off Foden. There's another brief VAR check on the tussle involving the City midfielder, who stayed down holding his face, but the officials are not needed to get involved.
Raya arrows a long pass forward for Jesus, who cuts back a cross towards the edge of the area. However, Trossard takes too long over his attempted shot and City crowd the Arsenal forward away from danger.
Haaland has the perfect opportunity to break away on the counter-attack but falls over as Saliba intervenes near the halfway line to intercept Lewis' throughball. The Norway striker wants a free-kick but referee Oliver is having none of his protests.
City speed forward on a rapid break before Alvarez curls a delightful cross towards the near post. Haaland is waiting for the chance to fall his way before Gabriel lunges in with a well-timed clearance to protect Raya's goal.
Gvardiol races around Foden on the overlap before curling another inviting delivery towards the back post. Raya gets underneath it and cannot claw away a clearance, but Haaland is caught on his heels as Zinchenko turns behind for a corner.
Foden's right-sided corner is cleared by Saliba, who has been fantastic in this first half. Just three minutes plus any additional stoppages remain for either side to strike first before half-time.
Arteta has beaten 23 of the 24 teams he's faced as a manager in the Premier League, failing only against City, losing all seven meetings. The Spaniard would love to get one over his former colleague Guardiola here.
Odegaard creates some promising space to City's right but Nketiah foolishly takes charge and is flagged for offside. The home crowd voice their frustrations as two additional minutes are indicated to end this first half.
Foden and Gabriel exchange words after the former fells the Brazil defender and concedes a free-kick inside Arsenal's half. There is an undercurrent of tension in this game, which may promise a more entertaining second period.
HALF-TIME: ARSENAL 0-0 MANCHESTER CITY
An attritional first half ends as Arsenal and City head into the interval goalless. Gvardiol saw an early chance cleared off the line before Ake powered over when presented with a great opening, but Guardiola's side may feel fortunate to have 11 men on the pitch still. Kovacic escaped a red card for a lunge on Odegaard that was checked by the VAR, before clumsily hacking down Rice moments later when on a yellow card. Referee Oliver did not deem the latter tackle worthy of further punishment, much to the Gunners' frustration.
Nketiah and Haaland have failed to produce any moments of quality up top for their respective sides. Guardiola and Arteta will be keen to find a way to get their strikers into the game in the second half, which will surely improve after a battling opening period. Whether City opt to withdraw Kovacic is another question for the visitors to ponder, too.
Arteta does not hesitate to change things, bringing on the fit-again Martinelli for Trossard at half-time.
Referee Oliver gets the second half under way!
Alvarez again offers Raya a scare as the Argentina forward chases down a clearance and almost makes contact with a sliding block in front of an empty Arsenal goal. Down the other end, Nketiah's touch is poor as Jesus plays a pass inside.
Every Martinelli touch is being greeted by a huge roar from Arsenal supporters as the winger curls a cross narrowly over Jesus at the back post. Walker will have a challenge on his hands down City's right-hand side this half.
CLOSE! Nketiah drives down the left flank before winning a corner, which Martinelli swings towards the six-yard area. Ederson fails to punch away but Jesus can only smash a right-footed first-time effort into Silva at the near post.
SAVE! Martinelli has livened up Arsenal's attacking play as Rice frees the winger into the area on the left of goal. The Brazil forward aims a left-footed drive towards the near post, where Ederson saves the Gunners' first shot on target of the game.
This was the first goalless first half between Arsenal and City in the Premier League since April 2012; a game that the Gunners went on to win with a goal from a familiar face… Mikel Arteta! The Spaniard will be hoping to replicate that feat here, although the Gunners’ manager will not be able to come on and score – that is for sure.
This clash is opening up as Jesus attempts to set Martinelli in behind before Ederson intervenes. Haaland then chases a loose ball before Saliba plays back to Raya. One chance could set this game alight into an end-to-end affair.
Foden offers Jesus a piece of his mind after the Brazil striker stays down following a challenge from behind. At the other end, Lewis bursts through two tackles and slots past Raya, but referee Oliver has already awarded a City free-kick for a nudge from behind by Martinelli.
There appears no real reason but Foden seems incredibly frenetic and aggressive in all of his play. The England international exchanged a few words with Gabriel in the first half, and did similar with Jesus a minute ago. Guardiola will hope his midfielder can channel that energy into scoring past Raya.
Alvarez bundles his way into the area and latches onto a Foden flick before seeing a low right-footed drive blocked by Gabriel in the centre of the box. Haaland then slips as he looks to slide a throughball in for the run of Alvarez.
Should City beat Arsenal, it would be the joint-longest Premier League winning run for a team against an opponent, equalling Manchester United against Wigan Athletic (13 between 2005 and 2011) and City themselves against West Brom (13 between 2012 and 2018).
A prolonged spell of Arsenal possession ends with Jesus slamming a right-footed cross against Ake and out for a corner. The Gunners have penned City back but can they make it count?
City deal with Odegaard's corner towards the near post before Zinchenko launches an ambitious effort well over Ederson's goal and into the stands.
Dias hangs a back-post centre towards Lewis but White stands tall to head behind for a City corner on the left-hand side.
Alvarez whips an inviting corner towards the near post but Raya does well to smash away a right-handed punch. Haaland was lurking just in front of the Arsenal goalkeeper, whose clearance was far more convincing than his first-half performance.
Guardiola takes the chance to make a triple substitution. The impressive Lewis is the first to make way for the fit-again Stones.
Kovacic, who somehow avoided a first-half dismissal, is finally hooked in favour of Nunes.
Doku replaces Alvarez as Guardiola opts for the winger's pace on the right-hand side.
Doku attempts to dance past Zinchenko but the Arsenal left-back stands firm and wins possession with a well-timed tackle. The City winger tries to repeat the trick but his cross is cleared at the near post.
Walker clumsily comes through the back of Martinelli, whose heels are clipped in the process of winning a free-kick near the halfway line. The City right-back is perhaps fortunate to escape a caution for a needless foul.
Martinelli and Walker are holding hands on the left-hand touchline but referee Oliver does not give a decision either way. Odegaard attempts to play through the middle but loses possession as Arteta prepares his next changes to alter this game.
Doku switches flanks and takes the first chance to run at White, who produces a last-ditch sliding block to concede a right-sided corner. Nunes delivers the set-piece but Raya catches well inside his six-yard area.
OVER! Martinelli skips inside the challenges of Walker and Silva before offloading inside to his right. Odegaard cuts in onto his left foot but can only hammer a drive that is always sailing over the top of Ederson's goal.
Arteta makes a triple substitution, the first of which sees Tomiyasu replace Zinchenko.
Nketiah makes way for Havertz.
Jorginho, who did well after his early yellow card, is also brought off for Partey in midfield.
Odegaard swings a right-sided corner towards the near post but Walker clears in front of White. Doku then tracks back to dispossess Rice but Arsenal soon regain possession.
City have faced 11 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League game this season. However, Arsenal have only tested Ederson once through Martinelli. Can the Gunners find another chance, which could snatch a narrow win?
Nunes powers past two Arsenal midfielders and exchanges a one-two with Haaland. The Gunners appear in danger and out of cover before Rice produces a perfect sliding lunge to intercept near the edge of his own area.
Foden looks to combine with Haaland but Rice is again there to intervene, winning a goal-kick for Arsenal after another fine tackle. City are on top heading into the closing stages, although both sides would feel aggrieved to not come away with anything from this game.
Odegaard almost breaks through the City defence before Jesus goes down following Ake's challenge at the near post. Referee Oliver shakes his head and says no penalty, as does the VAR after a quick check of the tackle.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLL! ARSENAL 1-0! The Emirates erupts as the Gunners fire themselves into a late lead. Partey's long ball is headed down by Tomiyasu to Havertz, who lays the ball off to the edge of the area. Martinelli races forward to curl a right-footed strike that deflects off Ake and slams into the bottom-left corner. Ederson has no chance as the City goalkeeper has already gone the other way, and Arteta's side are ahead!
Brought on from the bench, Havertz has taken his opportunity well. The Germany international offloads a simple pass for Martinelli, whose deflected finish has Arsenal on the brink of a memorable victory.
Arsenal are yet to lose in the Premier League this season (W5 D2), with this their longest unbeaten start to a league campaign since the 2007-08 term, when they were unbeaten in their first 15. However, this result could take things to a new level for Arteta's Gunners.
Raya decides now is the time to go long from the back, and Havertz takes his time when receiving possession on the left-hand side. Arsenal have just a few minutes to see out for a rare victory over City.
There will be four minutes of additional time to end this game... can Arsenal hold on?
Odegaard whips the Arsenal crowd into a frenzy of support after Gvardiol's throughball goes out for a goal-kick when looking for Doku. The Emirates Stadium is rocking as the seconds tick down towards a statement victory.
Ederson clatters into Jesus after the Arsenal striker knocks the ball away to stop City taking a quick free-kick. The City goalkeeper is shown a yellow card for his needless push.
Jesus is also shown a yellow card for wasting time by touching the ball away to stop the restart.
Ake and Dias are forward as Ederson launches long but the ball only finds Raya, who takes his time to pick it up and eats into some more valuable seconds. Arsenal are nearly there.
FULL-TIME: ARSENAL 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY
The Emirates Stadium erupts with a roar of celebration as Arsenal end a 12-game losing run against City in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over their title rivals. Buyako Saka was missing through injury, but it was the fit-again Martinelli who proved the hero. The Gunners winger came on at half-time before his 86th-minute deflected finish, off the unfortunate Ake, was the difference in an attrional clash between two title contenders. Arteta's side have their statement win going into the international break!
Arsenal may need the international break to come back down to earth after inflicting a memorable defeat on City, who have now lost two league games in a row, to go level with north London rivals Tottenham at the Premier League summit – Spurs lead the way on goals scored! The Gunners are at Chelsea next on October 21, when City will look to bounce back at home to Brighton. Guardiola's side trail Tottenham and Arteta's men by two points and must improve next time around.
That is all from this Arsenal victory over City in the Premier League. Until next time, it is goodbye for now!"	"Son Heung-min and James Maddison scored a goal in each half on a night where head coach Ange Postecoglou made history as Tottenham Hotspur returned to the top of the table with a 2-0 win over Fulham.
Postecoglou set a record of 23 points gained by a manager in their first nine Premier League matches (W7 D2 L0), beating the previous best of 22 jointly held by Mike Walker and Guus Hiddink.
Spurs started on the front foot and Maddison slipped a pass in to Son, whose fourth-minute shot was saved by Bernd Leno.
Micky van de Ven then volleyed over from Maddison's clipped pass, before Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario brilliantly saved Joao Palhinha's 14th-minute header to prevent Fulham going ahead against the run of play.
Fulham, who had not won in their previous 10 London derbies, including all four this season, continued to defend in numbers before a moment of magic by Son finally broke the deadlock on 36 minutes.
Richarlison played the ball into his path, Son sidestepped Tim Ream on the edge of the area and then curled a sublime strike beyond Leno.
Fulham's first-half blank was the seventh time in nine matches that the Cottagers had failed to score in the opening 45 minutes, behind only Luton Town and Crystal Palace (both eight) in the Premier League this season.
Marco Silva responded by bringing on Raul Jimenez and Alex Iwobi, but Spurs added a second goal nine minutes after the restart, this time Son capitalised on a Calvin Bassey error to tee up Maddison, who slotted home.
It was the midfielder's first home goal or assist of 2023/24 having produced all five of these away from home.
Fulham tried to get a foothold back in the match and had a few chances late on - Jimenez with a shot parried by Vicario and a Harry Wilson effort blocked by Emerson Royal - but Spurs proved comfortable victors.
Spurs, who leapfrogged Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City to go two points clear at the top, could move even further ahead when they kick off Matchweek 10 on Friday night with a trip to Palace.
A second defeat in three matches leaves Fulham in 13th place on 11 points.

Team_1 crushed Team_3 4-0 on the road in their last league outing and remain in the hunt at the top of the table. Pep Guardiola's side pipped the Gunners to the Premier League title last season, with this fixture offering Mikel Arteta's men the chance to inflict an early blow in what could be another closely contested fight for the top-flight crown. The hosts were undone in midweek by Lens in a 2-1 Champions League defeat, however.
City were shocked in their last league clash as the reigning English champions – and winners of the treble last season – fell to a surprise 2-1 defeat at Team_20. Guardiola's side responded in midweek with a 3-1 Champions League victory at RB Leipzig. However, Team_1 are unbeaten in the top flight as the first real test of City's latest Premier League title defence awaits.
Team_1 (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, Declan Rice; Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah, Leandro Trossard.

Should City beat Team_1, it would be the joint-longest Premier League winning run for a team against an opponent, equalling Team_14 against Wigan Athletic (13 between 2005 and 2011) and City themselves against West Brom (13 between 2012 and 2018).
A prolonged spell of Team_1 possession ends with Jesus slamming a right-footed cross against Ake and out for a corner. The Gunners have penned City back but can they make it count?
City deal with Odegaard's corner towards the near post before Zinchenko launches an ambitious effort well over Ederson's goal and into the stands.
Dias hangs a back-post centre towards Lewis but White stands tall to head behind for a City corner on the left-hand side.
Alvarez whips an inviting corner towards the near post but Raya does well to smash away a right-handed punch. Haaland was lurking just in front of the Team_1 goalkeeper, whose clearance was far more convincing than his first-half performance.
Guardiola takes the chance to make a triple substitution. The impressive Lewis is the first to make way for the fit-again Stones.
Kovacic, who somehow avoided a first-half dismissal, is finally hooked in favour of Nunes.
Doku replaces Alvarez as Guardiola opts for the winger's pace on the right-hand side.
Doku attempts to dance past Zinchenko but the Team_1 left-back stands firm and wins possession with a well-timed tackle. The City winger tries to repeat the trick but his cross is cleared at the near post.
Walker clumsily comes through the back of Martinelli, whose heels are clipped in the process of winning a free-kick near the halfway line. The City right-back is perhaps fortunate to escape a caution for a needless foul.
Martinelli and Walker are holding hands on the left-hand touchline but referee Oliver does not give a decision either way. Odegaard attempts to play through the middle but loses possession as Arteta prepares his next changes to alter this game.
Doku switches flanks and takes the first chance to run at White, who produces a last-ditch sliding block to concede a right-sided corner. Nunes delivers the set-piece but Raya catches well inside his six-yard area.
OVER! Martinelli skips inside the challenges of Walker and Silva before offloading inside to his right. Odegaard cuts in onto his left foot but can only hammer a drive that is always sailing over the top of Ederson's goal.
Arteta makes a triple substitution, the first of which sees Tomiyasu replace Zinchenko.
Nketiah makes way for Havertz.
Jorginho, who did well after his early yellow card, is also brought off for Partey in midfield.
Odegaard swings a right-sided corner towards the near post but Walker clears in front of White. Doku then tracks back to dispossess Rice but Team_1 soon regain possession.
City have faced 11 shots in this match, their most in a Premier League game this season. However, Team_1 have only tested Ederson once through Martinelli. Can the Gunners find another chance, which could snatch a narrow win?
Nunes powers past two Team_1 midfielders and exchanges a one-two with Haaland. The Gunners appear in danger and out of cover before Rice produces a perfect sliding lunge to intercept near the edge of his own area.
Foden looks to combine with Haaland but Rice is again there to intervene, winning a goal-kick for Team_1 after another fine tackle. City are on top heading into the closing stages, although both sides would feel aggrieved to not come away with anything from this game.
Odegaard almost breaks through the City defence before Jesus goes down following Ake's challenge at the near post. Referee Oliver shakes his head and says no penalty, as does the VAR after a quick check of the tackle.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLL! Team_1 1-0! The Emirates erupts as the Gunners fire themselves into a late lead. Partey's long ball is headed down by Tomiyasu to Havertz, who lays the ball off to the edge of the area. Martinelli races forward to curl a right-footed strike that deflects off Ake and slams into the bottom-left corner. Ederson has no chance as the City goalkeeper has already gone the other way, and Arteta's side are ahead!
Brought on from the bench, Havertz has taken his opportunity well. The Germany international offloads a simple pass for Martinelli, whose deflected finish has Team_1 on the brink of a memorable victory.
Team_1 are yet to lose in the Premier League this season (W5 D2), with this their longest unbeaten start to a league campaign since the 2007-08 term, when they were unbeaten in their first 15. However, this result could take things to a new level for Arteta's Gunners.
Raya decides now is the time to go long from the back, and Havertz takes his time when receiving possession on the left-hand side. Team_1 have just a few minutes to see out for a rare victory over City.
There will be four minutes of additional time to end this game... can Team_1 hold on?
Odegaard whips the Team_1 crowd into a frenzy of support after Gvardiol's throughball goes out for a goal-kick when looking for Doku. The Emirates Stadium is rocking as the seconds tick down towards a statement victory.
Ederson clatters into Jesus after the Team_1 striker knocks the ball away to stop City taking a quick free-kick. The City goalkeeper is shown a yellow card for his needless push.
Jesus is also shown a yellow card for wasting time by touching the ball away to stop the restart.
Ake and Dias are forward as Ederson launches long but the ball only finds Raya, who takes his time to pick it up and eats into some more valuable seconds. Team_1 are nearly there.
FULL-TIME: Team_1 1-0 Team_13
The Emirates Stadium erupts with a roar of celebration as Team_1 end a 12-game losing run against City in the Premier League with a 1-0 win over their title rivals. Buyako Saka was missing through injury, but it was the fit-again Martinelli who proved the hero. The Gunners winger came on at half-time before his 86th-minute deflected finish, off the unfortunate Ake, was the difference in an attrional clash between two title contenders. Arteta's side have their statement win going into the international break!
Team_1 may need the international break to come back down to earth after inflicting a memorable defeat on City, who have now lost two league games in a row, to go level with north London rivals Team_18 at the Premier League summit – Spurs lead the way on goals scored! The Gunners are at Team_7 next on October 21, when City will look to bounce back at home to Team_5. Guardiola's side trail Team_18 and Arteta's men by two points and must improve next time around.
That is all from this Team_1 victory over City in the Premier League. Until next time, it is goodbye for now!"	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93568	Nott'm Forest	West Ham	2024-02-17	The City Ground, Nottingham	29490.0	Thomas Bramall	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Villa Park.
Villa were somewhat surprised by a 3-1 defeat to Newcastle United in their last home outing but roared back into form with a 5-0 hammering of relegation-threatened Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Unai Emery’s men, who were knocked out of the FA Cup in midweek by Chelsea, are fifth in the league table heading into this clash.
Since a 2-1 defeat to Nottingham Forest at the end of December, United have reeled off five unbeaten games across all competitions in response. The Red Devils brushed aside Wigan Athletic and Newport County in the FA Cup, while defeating West Ham and Wolves after their draw with Tottenham in Premier League action. Erik ten Hag’s side are just a place behind Villa in the league table, although they trail the hosts by eight points.
ASTON VILLA (4-2-3-1): Emiliano Martinez; Matty Cash, Diego Carlos, Clement Lenglet, Alex Moreno; Boubacar Camara, Douglas Luiz; Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey, John McGinn; Ollie Watkins.
SUBSTITUTES: Youri Tielemans, Lucas Digne, Pau Torres, Moussa Diaby, Nicolo Zaniolo, Robin Olsen, Morgan Rogers, Kaine Kesler-Hayden, Tim Iroegbunam.
MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Luke Shaw; Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo; Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Rasmus Hojlund.
SUBSTITUTES: Altay Bayindir, Victor Lindelof, Sofyan Amrabat, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Antony, Jonny Evans, Scott McTominay, Omari Forson.
Emery makes just the sole change from the midweek defeat to Chelsea. Young midfielder Ramsey replaces Tielemans, starting in the middle of a three-man attack that includes McGinn and Bailey behind Watkins.
Ten Hag also opts for only one alteration from his last side that overcame West Ham. Lisandro Martinez is ruled out once again due to the centre-back’s knee injury, with Maguire getting the nod to start alongside Varane. Rashford, Fernandes and Garnacho are the trio supporting Hojlund in attack.
Villa won this exact fixture 3-1 last season, ending a 23-game winless run in the Premier League against Man Utd at Villa Park. They last won consecutive home league games against the Red Devils between 1966 and 1977 (five in a row). Can Emery’s side go back-to-back for the first time in what feels like an age? We’re about to find out as kick-off approaches…
Referee Robert Jones gets this Villa Park clash under way!
This could be a decisive game for United's unlikely Champions League hopes. Defeat would leave the Red Devils 11 points adrift of the top four, though victory would slice that deficit to just six from Tottenham.
Great tackle! Ramsey marauds down the left flank before Dalot manages a brilliant recovery challenge. The United right-back covered some ground to keep up with the Villa youngster there.
Over their last five Premier League matches, United have scored 13 goals, converting exactly 20 per cent of their shots in that time (65 attempts). In their five games beforehand, they only scored two goals with a conversion rate of three per cent (73 attempts). Can the Red Devils find their clinical shooting boots again here?
United play some slick football between Casemiro and Fernandes before the latter sends Hojlund racing through. However, Emery's high defensive lines earn their reward for being brave, with the visiting forward caught well offside.
Again! Rashford thinks there is space to attack but the United winger is flagged offside from a diagonal pass. Ten Hag's men know exactly what Villa do in defence, but the visitors have twice been caught wanting with their eager positioning.
Rashford parts the Villa defence with a driving run before offloading to Garnacho, whose attempt to square for Hojlund is deflected behind by Carlos. That was almost a huge chance for the Red Devils.
Fernandes hovers over the right-sided corner before delivering towards the penalty spot. Maguire gets a decent run towards the ball but fails to make contact, with Cash able to subsequently clear the danger.
A second corner for United comes in quick succession as Ramsey heads behind from Shaw's left-wing delivery with Garnacho lurking. Fernandes whips towards the far post once again but Maguire can only head harmlessly over Martinez's target.
HUGE CHANCE! Luiz inexplicably gives away possession on the edge of his own area, allowing Fernandes to roll through for Hojlund. The United striker cannot sort his feet quickly enough, though, as Carlos makes a vital block from the forward's left-footed effort. That was so close for the away side, who may feel Hojlund should have scored from there.
WIDE! Garnacho displays beautiful balance to dance around two tackles on the right-hand side before curling a left-footed effort towards the top-right corner. Martinez scrambles across but the United winger's attempt narrowly misses the target.
Ramsey stands up Mainoo before McGinn has two attempts at challenging Onana. The United defence stand firm, however, as the Scotland international then slides a wayward pass out of play for a goal-kick.
Kamara is fortunate to escape the first caution of the game after barging the marauding Rashford to the floor. The United winger has already twice been caught offside, but his efforts this time win a wide free-kick for his side.
GOOOOOOOOALLLLL! 1-0 UNITED! Villa do not heed the warning signs from the visitors’ set-pieces and the hosts pay the penalty! Fernandes swings another right-sided corner towards the far post, where Maguire towers above Kamara to redirect back into a dangerous area. Hojlund just stays onside and finishes past Martinez with a simple left-footed volley!
Maguire has had the run on Kamara for the last three corners, and this time makes it count. The United centre-back loops a header over the hosts' defence before Hojlund converts past Martinez from close range.
Hojlund has found the net in each of his last five Premier League appearances for Man Utd, after failing to score in any of his first 14 games in the competition. He’s the youngest player to score in as many consecutive games for the Red Devils and the only Danish player for any team to have achieved that feat in the Premier League.
Having fallen behind early to Chelsea in midweek, Villa have another salvaging act on their hands. Moreno gets the home crowd excited by winning a corner from Garnacho's sliding block.
Onana's defence stand firm from Villa's first corner of the game, clearing with ease. Ramsey then fires a warning shot but rifles his long-range right-footed effort well over the target.
CLOSE! Villa work it well across the United box before McGinn offloads to his right for Bailey, who cuts inside and misses the top-left corner with his whipped left-footed attempt. Onana never appeared too concerned by that chance.
GREAT STOP! Carlos launches a long pass over the top but Onana heads away outside of his area. Watkins recycles possession before passing inside for McGinn, whose rasping left-footed drive seems set for the top-left corner. The United goalkeeper is alert, though, diving to his right to parry away a wonderful save.
ANOTHER GOOD SAVE! United are cut open as McGinn hovers from distance before disguising a smart throughball for Watkins. Onana races out to close the angle, denying the Villa striker's low right-footed effort with his legs.
Onana stays down after denying Watkins from close range. The United goalkeeper appears to have taken a blow to his face, seemingly the price paid for a fine stop that keeps the visitors leading 1-0.
The United medical team have completed their work and Onana is fine to continue, at least for now. Questions have been asked about the visiting goalkeeper since his move from Inter but the Cameroon international is standing up to the Villa Park test at the moment.
ANOTHER CHANCE! It is one-way traffic at the minute as Moreno touches inside for Ramsey, who searches for the bottom-right corner with a whipped right-footed finish. Onana rushes across but watches on gratefully as the Villa midfielder narrowly misses his target.
Hojlund is the first United player to score in five consecutive Premier League appearances since Rashford in February 2023. His strike was also only the third goal the Red Devils have scored inside the opening 20 minutes on the road in the top flight this season.
Varane finds a pocket of space to slide through for Garnacho, whose right-wing delivery evades the onrushing Hojlund. United recycle possession, though, before giving the ball away. Bailey launches a long pass in search of Watkins but Onana races out to scuff an unconvincing clearance away for a throw-in.
United have won eight of their last nine Premier League matches in which they've scored first (D1). Can Ten Hag's hold on to their advantage here?
The home crowd are furious as Luiz appeals for a free-kick for fouls from both Hojlund and Mainoo. Down the other end, Hojlund also goes down under pressure from Lenglet but the referee again waves play on!
It has been somewhat one-way traffic in the last 10 minutes or so, but United are still defending resolutely and relying on some fine work from Onana. Villa are only going to up the tempo further, but it depends on whether Emery's men can take their chances or not.
It is an easy decision for referee Jones, who cautions Casemiro for catching the heels of Cash. The Villa right-back was bursting down the right-hand side and the United midfielder is perhaps fortunate to escape further punishment for his eccentric reaction.
Villa Park is bubbling away with frustration growing from the home supporters. Whether that annoyance is directed at Emery's players, United or the referee remains unclear. However, what is certain is that this atmosphere is not going to quieten if the hosts continue to trail.
Hojlund works his way down the right-hand side before his touch inside is inadvertently deflected behind for a corner. This could be another chance for United just before the interval.
Fernandes finds his target of Maguire once again from the corner but the centre-back's redirected header catches two team-mates offside. Lenglet and Carlos are still stuck in their zonal-marking instructions, with Maguire enjoying the freedom of Villa Park inside Martinez's box.
Shoot! McGinn's attempted shot cannons into the air but Bailey stalls, hesitates and hovers for too long, allowing Shaw to recover. The Villa winger had to pull the trigger with a left-footed volley there, though he did not and that let Onana collect with ease.
How is that not a yellow card? Fernandes scythes Bailey down with a sliding tackle near the right-hand touchline, but for some reason referee Jones opts to just warn the United captain. The home crowd are once again incensed but Villa will, at least, have a free-kick to attack.
McGinn stands over the wide free-kick, in a similar position to that he scored from against United at Old Trafford. The Villa midfielder delivers towards the near post and Onana makes a mess as he bundles behind for a corner.
Maguire rises the highest to head behind when McGinn delivers the first corner from the right-hand side. Luiz takes the second set-piece but Varane is on hand this time to head away.
There will be four minutes of additional time to end this half, owing to Hojlund's goal and the stoppage for Onana's injury after his collision with Watkins. Can the Red Devils hold on until the break?
Muted appeals for a penalty come from the home crowd as Moreno goes down under slight contact from Dalot. Referee Jones is having none of those claims, though, and points for a United goal-kick.
Dalot overlaps Garnacho and wins a right-sided corner from Moreno's recovering challenge. From the same place as Hojlund's opener came from, Fernandes opts to go short this time. Mainoo eventually crosses but fails to beat the first man before committing a cynical foul on McGinn, earning the second yellow card of this game.
Lenglet is also cautioned at the same time as Mainoo, seemingly for dissent towards the referee following the United midfielder's tactical foul on McGinn.
HALF-TIME: ASTON VILLA 0-1 MANCHESTER UNITED
An enjoyable first-half spectacle comes to an end as United lead Villa 1-0 on the road in the Premier League. Villa Park fell into silence as Maguire towered above Kamara to tee up Hojlund's simple 17th-minute opener. McGinn, Watkins and Ramsey all went close for Emery's side in response, but the hosts trail by a goal heading into the interval.
Emery has won both of his Premier League home games against United (2-0 with Arsenal in March 2019, 3-1 with Villa last season). He is aiming to become the first manager to win his first three at home against the Red Devils in the competition, though he needs a second-half fightback at Villa Park. The hosts have pushed and pressed but found resistance in the form of Onana, while United still look a threat on the break.
Ten Hag is forced into a half-time change, sending on Lindelof for Shaw, who seems to have suffered a first-half injury. Bailey may fancy his chances against the makeshift United left-back.
Referee Jones gets the second half under way at Villa Park! Neutral supporters will be wanting more of the same from the first-half action.
CHANCE! Rashford dances down the left flank, evading a couple of Villa tackles before bundling his way into the box. The United winger scuffs a low right-footed effort that Martinez saves with ease when diving down to his left.
United are unbeaten in their last 118 matches when leading 1-0 at half-time in the Premier League (W100 D18). Can Ten Hag's side keep up that immaculate record here?
WHAT A STOP! Cash stands up Lindelof before driving a low cross towards the near post. Watkins makes his way around Varane before smashing a right-footed strike straight at Onana. The United goalkeeper is completely unaware but somehow produces an inadvertent save with his chest! Ten Hag's men are riding their luck here.
Casemiro curls through for the bursting run of Garnacho, who cuts inside before being dispossessed by Lenglet. A belated offside flag proves the chance meaningless either way. This has been an end-to-end start to the second half!
Fernandes whips another right-sided corner towards the far post, where Maguire is beaten to the ball by two Villa defenders. The United centre-back appeals for handball but the referee waves play on, with the VAR concurring with the on-field decision.
Aged 21 years and 7 days, Hojlund is the second-youngest ever player to score in five successive Premier League appearances, only behind Nicolas Anelka for Arsenal in November 1998 (19y 239d). The United forward’s first-half strike remains the difference at Villa Park.
Kamara rolls through for Watkins, who battles his way to winning a corner from Varane's recovery tackle. McGinn curls an inswinger towards the far post, where Lindelof holds off Carlos to touch behind for another set-piece.
Luiz takes the second corner but Onana claims the next delivery with ease. The United goalkeeper has been an assured figure at the back for the visitors so far. Villa's set-pieces have left much to be desired for the home crowd, too.
Bailey stands up Lindelof in a one-on-one situation before the makeshift full-back blocks behind for a third Villa corner in quick succession. McGinn crosses once more but Casemiro is on hand to head clear. Lenglet and Carlos have to find more room from these chances.
Mainoo runs at Cash before offloading to Rashford, whose tame right-footed effort is deflected behind for a left-sided corner. Fernandes, as always, is the man to take the set-piece. The United midfielder goes short before Mainoo's cross is headed away with ease.
So close! Bailey races away on the counter-attack, beating two United defenders before sending an off-balance pass through for Ramsey. The Villa midfielder is travelling at some serious speed, though, and fails to control as Onana collects.
Perhaps struggling with the slippery surface, Cash scrambles and steams through Rashford with a lunging tackle from behind. The Villa right-back is cautioned by referee Jones, with Cash now facing a nervy final half-hour against the United winger.
Almost! Fernandes floats a left-sided free-kick towards the far post. Lenglet is unable to reach the delivery but Maguire is caught on his heels as the ball glides out for a goal-kick. Neither team have chance to catch their breath at the moment!
Diaby, Zaniolo or new signing Rogers are all attacking options on Villa's bench. How soon will Emery be tempted to bring one of those on?
Fernandes hammers over from Garnacho's cutback pass but the chance is again irrelevant as the latter has been caught offside from Hojlund's offload. The United captain may be a touch fortunate to escape a yellow card for knowingly delaying the restart by blazing out of play there.
Kamara needs some medical attention after pulling up in midfield. Emery, of course, has the ever-reliant Tielemans on the bench but will be hoping to not lose one of his key midfielders to injury.
Kamara is unable to continue and Emery reacts by sending on winger Diaby for the midfielder. His introduction may see Ramsey move further back, or McGinn could go and slot alongside Luiz in the base of Villa's midfield.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! VILLA EQUALISE! Finally, the hosts have their much-needed breakthrough as Luiz levels to make it 1-1. United survive the first scare from a corner as Onana denies Lenglet from point-blank range. The visitors scramble a clearance out to Diaby, who crashes a second volleyed delivery back into the six-yard box. Luiz is there, readying and waiting to tap into the roof of the net with a right-footed reactionary finish!
United have won 17 of their 28 Premier League away games against Villa – only the Red Devils themselves (19 against Everton) have beaten an opponent on the road more often in the competition. Ten Hag's side will have to respond now, though, after Luiz's leveller.
Shaw's half-time withdrawal has afforded Villa so much joy down United's left, with Bailey and Diaby causing all sorts of problems. Emery will be desperate for his side to continue focusing on that apparent weakness, with Lindelof struggling to cope.
SO CLOSE! United break with rapid pace as Garnacho bursts inside from the left flank, beating two defenders before curling a right-footed strike narrowly wide of the bottom-right corner. Martinez appears concerned but watches on gratefully as the United winger misses by the finest of margins.
In the build-up to Garnacho’s chance, Diaby takes the heels of Fernandes. Referee Jones remembers that, and cautions the Villa winger for his cynical trip near the left-hand touchline.
Diaby dances down the right flank before Ramsey steps over his cutback pass. Luiz takes too long, though, as Varane rushes out to block his left-footed drive from the edge of the United box.
Seemingly taking the defensive option, Ten Hag brings off winger Rashford for McTominay. That change may see Fernandes shifted out to the flanks.
Having caused Lindelof a fair few problems, Bailey's game comes to an end as Tielemans takes his place for Villa.
Luiz's leveller was his seventh goal this season, a new season-best for the Villa midfielder in the Premier League. Can the Brazilian add further damage to power the hosts to victory?
BIG CHANCE! Diaby's first cross is cleared by Dalot before McGinn swings another far-post delivery in. Dalot is again on hand but prods straight into the path of Luiz, who scuffs a left-footed effort straight at Onana when looking for the bottom-right corner. The Villa midfielder may rue that missed opportunity.
Each of Luiz's last nine Premier League goals have come at Villa Park, including all seven this season; this is the most by a player to score 100 per cent of their goals at a single ground in the competition in 2023-24. The Villa midfielder should have added another just moments ago, though.
Lindelof clips an aimless pass out of play, further encouraging the buoyant home crowd. Just over 10 minutes remain at Villa Park, where Emery's men will fancy their chances of a late winner.
DIABY MUST DO BETTER! Mainoo makes a mess of the bouncing ball, allowing Luiz to feed McGinn, who rolls into the inside right-hand channel for Diaby. The Villa winger has Watkins and Ramsey in support but curls a poor left-footed effort wide of Onana's top-left corner.
Watkins has been directly involved in 38 goals in 47 Premier League appearances for Villa under Emery (24 goals, 14 assists), averaging a goal or assist every 107 minutes. Of Villa players to play at least 1,000 minutes under a manager in the Premier League, only Christian Benteke under Tim Sherwood (goal or assist every 96 mins) has a better average. Watkins has twice been denied by Onana already, but can the England striker find the winner?
McGinn is furious after feeling he has broken away from Maguire, who pulls back on his shirt to concede a free-kick. Somehow, the United centre-back escapes further disciplinary action for his cynical foul.
Since winning 15 home Premier League games in a row between March and December 2023, Villa have won one of their last three (D1 L1), only conceding one fewer goal in the last three games (six) than they did across their entire 15 game winning run (seven). The hosts do not have long left to find a late winner here.
Casemiro angles a delightful diagonal pass for Dalot, who fails to beat Moreno and instead has to settle for a throw in front of the away supporters. The United right-back had so many options there but, for some reason, tried to go it alone and take the selfish option.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! UNITED HIT THE FRONT ONCE MORE! The away end explodes into chaotic celebrations as the Red Devils make it 2-1 with just over four minutes remaining. Having failed to beat Moreno moments before, Dalot makes amends with a delightful right-wing cross. McTominay has the run on Cash at the back post and powers a thumping header through the hands of Martinez. The Villa goalkeeper has no time to react and United’s Champions League dream is back alive!
Mainoo runs into the channel before offloading to Dalot, who curls an inviting right-wing cross towards the far post for McTominay to finish past Martinez with a smashing header.
Emery enters last-chance saloon. Villa send on attacker Zaniolo for holding-midfielder McGinn.
Digne makes his return from injury for the closing stages, replacing left-back Moreno.
Diaby steams around Lindelof but his far-post cross is poor, with Fernandes buying a cheap free-kick from a needless Digne foul. Emery cuts a frustrated figure on the touchline, with Villa set to drop further ground in the top-four race.
SAVE! With England manager Gareth Southgate in attendance, Watkins has the chance to be the late hero. Cash clips a simple right-wing cross towards the penalty spot, from which Watkins heads straight at Onana. That is the Villa striker's third shot on target from close range, but the United goalkeeper is again equal to the effort.
United supporters are making all the noise inside Villa Park as the fourth official indicates a minimum of six additional minutes. Can Emery's side find a late equaliser and, in turn, damage the Red Devils' growing top-four hopes?
Fernandes, almost acting as a second right-back alongside Dalot, makes a wonderful recovery tackle on Digne. That stoppage in play allows Ten Hag to bring off Hojlund, the scorer of the first goal, for Evans.
Mainoo has acted with expert brilliance belying his young age, despite playing on thin ice from his first-half yellow card. The United youngster comes off for Amrabat, who returns for the Red Devils after his Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco.
CLOSE! Cash decides to go it alone, cutting inside from the right-hand side before drilling a stinging left-footed effort towards the roof of Onana's goal. The United goalkeeper does not have any problems, though, catching the attempt with ease and eating into some more valuable seconds.
Time continues to tick on at Villa Park as United sit deep and defend their narrow lead. The visitors are in survival mode and, for now, will have a vital three points to take back to Manchester.
Zaniolo is the target but Carlos' hopeful deep delivery is comfortably claimed by Onana. Villa Park erupts into a frenzy of frustration, much to the delight of the vociferous away supporters in the near corner.
Think! Tielemans crashes through the back of Varane, conceding a needless and cheap free-kick that wastes more much-needed time for Villa. Emery's expression is blank on the touchline as the home side head towards another defeat.
FULL-TIME: ASTON VILLA 1-2 MANCHESTER UNITED
Man Utd boost their top-four hopes in the Premier League after a battling 2-1 victory over Villa on the road. Having watched Chelsea dump them out the FA Cup in midweek, Villa Park was once again disappointed when Maguire towered above Kamara from Fernandes’ corner to tee up Hojlund’s 17th-minute opener. That marked Hojlund’s fifth straight top-flight game that he has scored in before McGinn, Watkins and Ramsey all tested Onana in response to the early strike from the away side. Watkins was again denied by the United goalkeeper after the interval, only for Luiz to crash into the roof of the net to equalise after 67 minutes from Diaby’s hopeful right-wing centre. Emery’s men may have fancied their chances of a late winner, though it was the visitors who stepped up as McTominay thumped a header past Martinez from Dalot’s right-wing cross, stealing all three points four minutes from time. This victory takes Ten Hag’s men within five points of Villa and six away from fourth-placed Tottenham, ahead of their next game when they visit Luton Town on Sunday. Emery’s side are in desperate need of a response when they travel to Fulham on Saturday. That is all for now, until next time! Goodbye and thanks for following this live coverage from Villa Park."	"Nottingham Forest earned a first league win of the year as goals from Taiwo Awoniyi and Callum Hudson-Odoi earned them a 2-0 victory over 10-man West Ham United that took them five points clear of the relegation zone. 
West Ham have now gone six matches without a victory, losing the last three without scoring a goal.
How the match unfolded
There were two changes apiece at the City Ground. Nuno Espirito Santo handed starts to Brazilians Felipe and Danilo, with Moussa Niakhate and Ryan Yates making way from the side that lost 3-2 to Newcastle United.
David Moyes brought in Kalvin Phillips and Michail Antonio for Ben Johnson and Tomas Soucek.
Forest made a bright start and forced an early save from Alphonse Areola, who denied Anthony Elanga brilliantly with his feet.
The hosts went close again just before the half-hour when Nicolas Dominguez's blocked shot fell to Morgan Gibbs-White, who fired his effort straight at the West Ham ’keeper. 
Forest eventually opened the scoring in the fifth minute of first-half added time through Awoniyi.
Nayef Aguerd could only head a cross away as far as Dominguez, and his low pass back into the penalty area found Awoniyi, who spun away from Aguerd before firing past Areola.
West Ham were reduced to 10 men on 71 minutes when Phillips was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Gibbs-White.
Forest took a firm grip of the contest and went close to doubling their lead when Elanga skied over the crossbar.
The home side did make it 2-0 in the fourth minute of stoppage time, the ball falling to Hudson-Odoi, who fired low into the bottom-left corner to net in a third consecutive match.
Forest climb one place to 15th on 24 points, while West Ham remain eighth on 36 points.

Villa were somewhat surprised by a 3-1 defeat to Team_15 in their last home outing but roared back into form with a 5-0 hammering of relegation-threatened Team_17 at Bramall Lane. Unai Emery’s men, who were knocked out of the FA Cup in midweek by Team_7, are fifth in the league table heading into this clash.
Since a 2-1 defeat to Team_16 at the end of December, United have reeled off five unbeaten games across all competitions in response. The Red Devils brushed aside Wigan Athletic and Newport County in the FA Cup, while defeating Team_19 and Team_20 after their draw with Team_18 in Premier League action. Erik ten Hag’s side are just a place behind Villa in the league table, although they trail the hosts by eight points.
Team_2 (4-2-3-1): Emiliano Martinez; Matty Cash, Diego Carlos, Clement Lenglet, Alex Moreno; Boubacar Camara, Douglas Luiz; Leon Bailey, Jacob Ramsey, John McGinn; Ollie Watkins.
SUBSTITUTES: Youri Tielemans, Lucas Digne, Pau Torres, Moussa Diaby, Nicolo Zaniolo, Robin Olsen, Morgan Rogers, Kaine Kesler-Hayden, Tim Iroegbunam.
Team_14 (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane, Luke Shaw; Casemiro, Kobbie Mainoo; Alejandro Garnacho, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Rasmus Hojlund.
SUBSTITUTES: Altay Bayindir, Victor Lindelof, Sofyan Amrabat, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Antony, Jonny Evans, Scott McTominay, Omari Forson.
Emery makes just the sole change from the midweek defeat to Team_7. Young midfielder Ramsey replaces Tielemans, starting in the middle of a three-man attack that includes McGinn and Bailey behind Watkins.
Ten Hag also opts for only one alteration from his last side that overcame Team_19. Lisandro Martinez is ruled out once again due to the centre-back’s knee injury, with Maguire getting the nod to start alongside Varane. Rashford, Fernandes and Garnacho are the trio supporting Hojlund in attack.
Villa won this exact fixture 3-1 last season, ending a 23-game winless run in the Premier League against Man Utd at Villa Park. They last won consecutive home league games against the Red Devils between 1966 and 1977 (five in a row). Can Emery’s side go back-to-back for the first time in what feels like an age? We’re about to find out as kick-off approaches…
Referee Robert Jones gets this Villa Park clash under way!
This could be a decisive game for United's unlikely Champions League hopes. Defeat would leave the Red Devils 11 points adrift of the top four, though victory would slice that deficit to just six from Team_18.
Great tackle! Ramsey marauds down the left flank before Dalot manages a brilliant recovery challenge. The United right-back covered some ground to keep up with the Villa youngster there.
Over their last five Premier League matches, United have scored 13 goals, converting exactly 20 per cent of their shots in that time (65 attempts). In their five games beforehand, they only scored two goals with a conversion rate of three per cent (73 attempts). Can the Red Devils find their clinical shooting boots again here?
United play some slick football between Casemiro and Fernandes before the latter sends Hojlund racing through. However, Emery's high defensive lines earn their reward for being brave, with the visiting forward caught well offside.
Again! Rashford thinks there is space to attack but the United winger is flagged offside from a diagonal pass. Ten Hag's men know exactly what Villa do in defence, but the visitors have twice been caught wanting with their eager positioning.
Rashford parts the Villa defence with a driving run before offloading to Garnacho, whose attempt to square for Hojlund is deflected behind by Carlos. That was almost a huge chance for the Red Devils.
Fernandes hovers over the right-sided corner before delivering towards the penalty spot. Maguire gets a decent run towards the ball but fails to make contact, with Cash able to subsequently clear the danger.
A second corner for United comes in quick succession as Ramsey heads behind from Shaw's left-wing delivery with Garnacho lurking. Fernandes whips towards the far post once again but Maguire can only head harmlessly over Martinez's target.
HUGE CHANCE! Luiz inexplicably gives away possession on the edge of his own area, allowing Fernandes to roll through for Hojlund. The United striker cannot sort his feet quickly enough, though, as Carlos makes a vital block from the forward's left-footed effort. That was so close for the away side, who may feel Hojlund should have scored from there.
WIDE! Garnacho displays beautiful balance to dance around two tackles on the right-hand side before curling a left-footed effort towards the top-right corner. Martinez scrambles across but the United winger's attempt narrowly misses the target.
Ramsey stands up Mainoo before McGinn has two attempts at challenging Onana. The United defence stand firm, however, as the Scotland international then slides a wayward pass out of play for a goal-kick.
Kamara is fortunate to escape the first caution of the game after barging the marauding Rashford to the floor. The United winger has already twice been caught offside, but his efforts this time win a wide free-kick for his side.
GOOOOOOOOALLLLL! 1-0 UNITED! Villa do not heed the warning signs from the visitors’ set-pieces and the hosts pay the penalty! Fernandes swings another right-sided corner towards the far post, where Maguire towers above Kamara to redirect back into a dangerous area. Hojlund just stays onside and finishes past Martinez with a simple left-footed volley!
Maguire has had the run on Kamara for the last three corners, and this time makes it count. The United centre-back loops a header over the hosts' defence before Hojlund converts past Martinez from close range.
Hojlund has found the net in each of his last five Premier League appearances for Man Utd, after failing to score in any of his first 14 games in the competition. He’s the youngest player to score in as many consecutive games for the Red Devils and the only Danish player for any team to have achieved that feat in the Premier League.
Having fallen behind early to Team_7 in midweek, Villa have another salvaging act on their hands. Moreno gets the home crowd excited by winning a corner from Garnacho's sliding block.
Onana's defence stand firm from Villa's first corner of the game, clearing with ease. Ramsey then fires a warning shot but rifles his long-range right-footed effort well over the target.
CLOSE! Villa work it well across the United box before McGinn offloads to his right for Bailey, who cuts inside and misses the top-left corner with his whipped left-footed attempt. Onana never appeared too concerned by that chance.
GREAT STOP! Carlos launches a long pass over the top but Onana heads away outside of his area. Watkins recycles possession before passing inside for McGinn, whose rasping left-footed drive seems set for the top-left corner. The United goalkeeper is alert, though, diving to his right to parry away a wonderful save.
ANOTHER GOOD SAVE! United are cut open as McGinn hovers from distance before disguising a smart throughball for Watkins. Onana races out to close the angle, denying the Villa striker's low right-footed effort with his legs.
Onana stays down after denying Watkins from close range. The United goalkeeper appears to have taken a blow to his face, seemingly the price paid for a fine stop that keeps the visitors leading 1-0.
The United medical team have completed their work and Onana is fine to continue, at least for now. Questions have been asked about the visiting goalkeeper since his move from Inter but the Cameroon international is standing up to the Villa Park test at the moment.
ANOTHER CHANCE! It is one-way traffic at the minute as Moreno touches inside for Ramsey, who searches for the bottom-right corner with a whipped right-footed finish. Onana rushes across but watches on gratefully as the Villa midfielder narrowly misses his target.
Hojlund is the first United player to score in five consecutive Premier League appearances since Rashford in February 2023. His strike was also only the third goal the Red Devils have scored inside the opening 20 minutes on the road in the top flight this season.
Varane finds a pocket of space to slide through for Garnacho, whose right-wing delivery evades the onrushing Hojlund. United recycle possession, though, before giving the ball away. Bailey launches a long pass in search of Watkins but Onana races out to scuff an unconvincing clearance away for a throw-in.
United have won eight of their last nine Premier League matches in which they've scored first (D1). Can Ten Hag's hold on to their advantage here?
The home crowd are furious as Luiz appeals for a free-kick for fouls from both Hojlund and Mainoo. Down the other end, Hojlund also goes down under pressure from Lenglet but the referee again waves play on!
It has been somewhat one-way traffic in the last 10 minutes or so, but United are still defending resolutely and relying on some fine work from Onana. Villa are only going to up the tempo further, but it depends on whether Emery's men can take their chances or not.
It is an easy decision for referee Jones, who cautions Casemiro for catching the heels of Cash. The Villa right-back was bursting down the right-hand side and the United midfielder is perhaps fortunate to escape further punishment for his eccentric reaction.
Villa Park is bubbling away with frustration growing from the home supporters. Whether that annoyance is directed at Emery's players, United or the referee remains unclear. However, what is certain is that this atmosphere is not going to quieten if the hosts continue to trail.
Hojlund works his way down the right-hand side before his touch inside is inadvertently deflected behind for a corner. This could be another chance for United just before the interval.
Fernandes finds his target of Maguire once again from the corner but the centre-back's redirected header catches two team-mates offside. Lenglet and Carlos are still stuck in their zonal-marking instructions, with Maguire enjoying the freedom of Villa Park inside Martinez's box.
Shoot! McGinn's attempted shot cannons into the air but Bailey stalls, hesitates and hovers for too long, allowing Shaw to recover. The Villa winger had to pull the trigger with a left-footed volley there, though he did not and that let Onana collect with ease.
How is that not a yellow card? Fernandes scythes Bailey down with a sliding tackle near the right-hand touchline, but for some reason referee Jones opts to just warn the United captain. The home crowd are once again incensed but Villa will, at least, have a free-kick to attack.
McGinn stands over the wide free-kick, in a similar position to that he scored from against United at Old Trafford. The Villa midfielder delivers towards the near post and Onana makes a mess as he bundles behind for a corner.
Maguire rises the highest to head behind when McGinn delivers the first corner from the right-hand side. Luiz takes the second set-piece but Varane is on hand this time to head away.
There will be four minutes of additional time to end this half, owing to Hojlund's goal and the stoppage for Onana's injury after his collision with Watkins. Can the Red Devils hold on until the break?
Muted appeals for a penalty come from the home crowd as Moreno goes down under slight contact from Dalot. Referee Jones is having none of those claims, though, and points for a United goal-kick.
Dalot overlaps Garnacho and wins a right-sided corner from Moreno's recovering challenge. From the same place as Hojlund's opener came from, Fernandes opts to go short this time. Mainoo eventually crosses but fails to beat the first man before committing a cynical foul on McGinn, earning the second yellow card of this game.
Lenglet is also cautioned at the same time as Mainoo, seemingly for dissent towards the referee following the United midfielder's tactical foul on McGinn.
HALF-TIME: Team_2 0-1 Team_14
An enjoyable first-half spectacle comes to an end as United lead Villa 1-0 on the road in the Premier League. Villa Park fell into silence as Maguire towered above Kamara to tee up Hojlund's simple 17th-minute opener. McGinn, Watkins and Ramsey all went close for Emery's side in response, but the hosts trail by a goal heading into the interval.
Emery has won both of his Premier League home games against United (2-0 with Team_1 in March 2019, 3-1 with Villa last season). He is aiming to become the first manager to win his first three at home against the Red Devils in the competition, though he needs a second-half fightback at Villa Park. The hosts have pushed and pressed but found resistance in the form of Onana, while United still look a threat on the break.
Ten Hag is forced into a half-time change, sending on Lindelof for Shaw, who seems to have suffered a first-half injury. Bailey may fancy his chances against the makeshift United left-back.
Referee Jones gets the second half under way at Villa Park! Neutral supporters will be wanting more of the same from the first-half action.
CHANCE! Rashford dances down the left flank, evading a couple of Villa tackles before bundling his way into the box. The United winger scuffs a low right-footed effort that Martinez saves with ease when diving down to his left.
United are unbeaten in their last 118 matches when leading 1-0 at half-time in the Premier League (W100 D18). Can Ten Hag's side keep up that immaculate record here?
WHAT A STOP! Cash stands up Lindelof before driving a low cross towards the near post. Watkins makes his way around Varane before smashing a right-footed strike straight at Onana. The United goalkeeper is completely unaware but somehow produces an inadvertent save with his chest! Ten Hag's men are riding their luck here.
Casemiro curls through for the bursting run of Garnacho, who cuts inside before being dispossessed by Lenglet. A belated offside flag proves the chance meaningless either way. This has been an end-to-end start to the second half!
Fernandes whips another right-sided corner towards the far post, where Maguire is beaten to the ball by two Villa defenders. The United centre-back appeals for handball but the referee waves play on, with the VAR concurring with the on-field decision.
Aged 21 years and 7 days, Hojlund is the second-youngest ever player to score in five successive Premier League appearances, only behind Nicolas Anelka for Team_1 in November 1998 (19y 239d). The United forward’s first-half strike remains the difference at Villa Park.
Kamara rolls through for Watkins, who battles his way to winning a corner from Varane's recovery tackle. McGinn curls an inswinger towards the far post, where Lindelof holds off Carlos to touch behind for another set-piece.
Luiz takes the second corner but Onana claims the next delivery with ease. The United goalkeeper has been an assured figure at the back for the visitors so far. Villa's set-pieces have left much to be desired for the home crowd, too.
Bailey stands up Lindelof in a one-on-one situation before the makeshift full-back blocks behind for a third Villa corner in quick succession. McGinn crosses once more but Casemiro is on hand to head clear. Lenglet and Carlos have to find more room from these chances.
Mainoo runs at Cash before offloading to Rashford, whose tame right-footed effort is deflected behind for a left-sided corner. Fernandes, as always, is the man to take the set-piece. The United midfielder goes short before Mainoo's cross is headed away with ease.
So close! Bailey races away on the counter-attack, beating two United defenders before sending an off-balance pass through for Ramsey. The Villa midfielder is travelling at some serious speed, though, and fails to control as Onana collects.
Perhaps struggling with the slippery surface, Cash scrambles and steams through Rashford with a lunging tackle from behind. The Villa right-back is cautioned by referee Jones, with Cash now facing a nervy final half-hour against the United winger.
Almost! Fernandes floats a left-sided free-kick towards the far post. Lenglet is unable to reach the delivery but Maguire is caught on his heels as the ball glides out for a goal-kick. Neither team have chance to catch their breath at the moment!
Diaby, Zaniolo or new signing Rogers are all attacking options on Villa's bench. How soon will Emery be tempted to bring one of those on?
Fernandes hammers over from Garnacho's cutback pass but the chance is again irrelevant as the latter has been caught offside from Hojlund's offload. The United captain may be a touch fortunate to escape a yellow card for knowingly delaying the restart by blazing out of play there.
Kamara needs some medical attention after pulling up in midfield. Emery, of course, has the ever-reliant Tielemans on the bench but will be hoping to not lose one of his key midfielders to injury.
Kamara is unable to continue and Emery reacts by sending on winger Diaby for the midfielder. His introduction may see Ramsey move further back, or McGinn could go and slot alongside Luiz in the base of Villa's midfield.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! VILLA EQUALISE! Finally, the hosts have their much-needed breakthrough as Luiz levels to make it 1-1. United survive the first scare from a corner as Onana denies Lenglet from point-blank range. The visitors scramble a clearance out to Diaby, who crashes a second volleyed delivery back into the six-yard box. Luiz is there, readying and waiting to tap into the roof of the net with a right-footed reactionary finish!
United have won 17 of their 28 Premier League away games against Villa – only the Red Devils themselves (19 against Team_9) have beaten an opponent on the road more often in the competition. Ten Hag's side will have to respond now, though, after Luiz's leveller.
Shaw's half-time withdrawal has afforded Villa so much joy down United's left, with Bailey and Diaby causing all sorts of problems. Emery will be desperate for his side to continue focusing on that apparent weakness, with Lindelof struggling to cope.
SO CLOSE! United break with rapid pace as Garnacho bursts inside from the left flank, beating two defenders before curling a right-footed strike narrowly wide of the bottom-right corner. Martinez appears concerned but watches on gratefully as the United winger misses by the finest of margins.
In the build-up to Garnacho’s chance, Diaby takes the heels of Fernandes. Referee Jones remembers that, and cautions the Villa winger for his cynical trip near the left-hand touchline.
Diaby dances down the right flank before Ramsey steps over his cutback pass. Luiz takes too long, though, as Varane rushes out to block his left-footed drive from the edge of the United box.
Seemingly taking the defensive option, Ten Hag brings off winger Rashford for McTominay. That change may see Fernandes shifted out to the flanks.
Having caused Lindelof a fair few problems, Bailey's game comes to an end as Tielemans takes his place for Villa.
Luiz's leveller was his seventh goal this season, a new season-best for the Villa midfielder in the Premier League. Can the Brazilian add further damage to power the hosts to victory?
BIG CHANCE! Diaby's first cross is cleared by Dalot before McGinn swings another far-post delivery in. Dalot is again on hand but prods straight into the path of Luiz, who scuffs a left-footed effort straight at Onana when looking for the bottom-right corner. The Villa midfielder may rue that missed opportunity.
Each of Luiz's last nine Premier League goals have come at Villa Park, including all seven this season; this is the most by a player to score 100 per cent of their goals at a single ground in the competition in 2023-24. The Villa midfielder should have added another just moments ago, though.
Lindelof clips an aimless pass out of play, further encouraging the buoyant home crowd. Just over 10 minutes remain at Villa Park, where Emery's men will fancy their chances of a late winner.
DIABY MUST DO BETTER! Mainoo makes a mess of the bouncing ball, allowing Luiz to feed McGinn, who rolls into the inside right-hand channel for Diaby. The Villa winger has Watkins and Ramsey in support but curls a poor left-footed effort wide of Onana's top-left corner.
Watkins has been directly involved in 38 goals in 47 Premier League appearances for Villa under Emery (24 goals, 14 assists), averaging a goal or assist every 107 minutes. Of Villa players to play at least 1,000 minutes under a manager in the Premier League, only Christian Benteke under Tim Sherwood (goal or assist every 96 mins) has a better average. Watkins has twice been denied by Onana already, but can the England striker find the winner?
McGinn is furious after feeling he has broken away from Maguire, who pulls back on his shirt to concede a free-kick. Somehow, the United centre-back escapes further disciplinary action for his cynical foul.
Since winning 15 home Premier League games in a row between March and December 2023, Villa have won one of their last three (D1 L1), only conceding one fewer goal in the last three games (six) than they did across their entire 15 game winning run (seven). The hosts do not have long left to find a late winner here.
Casemiro angles a delightful diagonal pass for Dalot, who fails to beat Moreno and instead has to settle for a throw in front of the away supporters. The United right-back had so many options there but, for some reason, tried to go it alone and take the selfish option.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! UNITED HIT THE FRONT ONCE MORE! The away end explodes into chaotic celebrations as the Red Devils make it 2-1 with just over four minutes remaining. Having failed to beat Moreno moments before, Dalot makes amends with a delightful right-wing cross. McTominay has the run on Cash at the back post and powers a thumping header through the hands of Martinez. The Villa goalkeeper has no time to react and United’s Champions League dream is back alive!
Mainoo runs into the channel before offloading to Dalot, who curls an inviting right-wing cross towards the far post for McTominay to finish past Martinez with a smashing header.
Emery enters last-chance saloon. Villa send on attacker Zaniolo for holding-midfielder McGinn.
Digne makes his return from injury for the closing stages, replacing left-back Moreno.
Diaby steams around Lindelof but his far-post cross is poor, with Fernandes buying a cheap free-kick from a needless Digne foul. Emery cuts a frustrated figure on the touchline, with Villa set to drop further ground in the top-four race.
SAVE! With England manager Gareth Southgate in attendance, Watkins has the chance to be the late hero. Cash clips a simple right-wing cross towards the penalty spot, from which Watkins heads straight at Onana. That is the Villa striker's third shot on target from close range, but the United goalkeeper is again equal to the effort.
United supporters are making all the noise inside Villa Park as the fourth official indicates a minimum of six additional minutes. Can Emery's side find a late equaliser and, in turn, damage the Red Devils' growing top-four hopes?
Fernandes, almost acting as a second right-back alongside Dalot, makes a wonderful recovery tackle on Digne. That stoppage in play allows Ten Hag to bring off Hojlund, the scorer of the first goal, for Evans.
Mainoo has acted with expert brilliance belying his young age, despite playing on thin ice from his first-half yellow card. The United youngster comes off for Amrabat, who returns for the Red Devils after his Africa Cup of Nations with Morocco.
CLOSE! Cash decides to go it alone, cutting inside from the right-hand side before drilling a stinging left-footed effort towards the roof of Onana's goal. The United goalkeeper does not have any problems, though, catching the attempt with ease and eating into some more valuable seconds.
Time continues to tick on at Villa Park as United sit deep and defend their narrow lead. The visitors are in survival mode and, for now, will have a vital three points to take back to Manchester.
Zaniolo is the target but Carlos' hopeful deep delivery is comfortably claimed by Onana. Villa Park erupts into a frenzy of frustration, much to the delight of the vociferous away supporters in the near corner.
Think! Tielemans crashes through the back of Varane, conceding a needless and cheap free-kick that wastes more much-needed time for Villa. Emery's expression is blank on the touchline as the home side head towards another defeat.
FULL-TIME: Team_2 1-2 Team_14
Man Utd boost their top-four hopes in the Premier League after a battling 2-1 victory over Villa on the road. Having watched Team_7 dump them out the FA Cup in midweek, Villa Park was once again disappointed when Maguire towered above Kamara from Fernandes’ corner to tee up Hojlund’s 17th-minute opener. That marked Hojlund’s fifth straight top-flight game that he has scored in before McGinn, Watkins and Ramsey all tested Onana in response to the early strike from the away side. Watkins was again denied by the United goalkeeper after the interval, only for Luiz to crash into the roof of the net to equalise after 67 minutes from Diaby’s hopeful right-wing centre. Emery’s men may have fancied their chances of a late winner, though it was the visitors who stepped up as McTominay thumped a header past Martinez from Dalot’s right-wing cross, stealing all three points four minutes from time. This victory takes Ten Hag’s men within five points of Villa and six away from fourth-placed Team_18, ahead of their next game when they visit Team_12 on Sunday. Emery’s side are in desperate need of a response when they travel to Team_10 on Saturday. That is all for now, until next time! Goodbye and thanks for following this live coverage from Villa Park."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93396	Fulham	Sheffield Utd	2023-10-07	Craven Cottage, London	24361.0	Samuel Barrott	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the North London derby between Arsenal and Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium.
These fierce rivals meet in the Premier League for the first time this season, the latest edition of a derby that seems to always produce thrilling encounters. The Gunners currently hold the bragging rights, finishing 24 points and six places above Spurs last term while winning both of the meetings between the sides, and they have enjoyed another strong start to this campaign, currently unbeaten and in the top four.
The Ange Postecoglou era at Spurs has had a brilliant opening, with the former Celtic boss taking four wins from his first five Premier League games in charge to put his new side second in the standings. This is their biggest test yet, though, so it will be interesting to see how Postecoglou's side fare.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Fabio Vieira; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah.
SUBS: Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith Rowe, Kai Havertz, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jorginho, Jakub Kiwior, Mohamed Elneny.
TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma; Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Son Heung-min; Brennan Johnson.
SUBS: Fraser Forster, Eric Dier, Alejo Veliz, Ben Davies, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Oliver Skipp, Richarlison, Manor Solomon, Emerson.
Mikel Arteta makes two changes from the side that hammered PSV 4-0 in midweek as Vieira and Nketiah come in for Havertz and Leandro Trossard, the latter of whom misses out altogether after picking up a knock in training. Gabriel Martinelli is also absent as Raya retains his place between the sticks.
Postecoglou goes with just the one alteration from the starting XI that came back in dramatic fashion to beat Sheffield United last time out as Johnson makes his full debut, with Solomon dropping to the bench. Ivan Perisic suffered a serious knee injury in training and looks like he will miss the rest of the season.
The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of the North London derby!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way!
NO GOAL! Tottenham have an early strike ruled out as Bissouma's shot is turned home by Son from close range, with the flag immediately going up for offside.
The big challenges are flying in already, exactly what you would expect from such a heated derby. Which side will keep their heads the better?
Romero is perhaps fortunate to avoid a booking as he crunches through the back of Jesus in midfield. The referee Robert Jones opts to keep his cards in his pockets.
Arsenal have won four of their last five Premier League games against Tottenham (one loss), as many victories as they had in their previous 16 against them beforehand.
The game is yet to get into a real rhythm with lots of scrappy fouls disrupting the flow. The referee has been a busy man so far.
Tottenham have won just one of their last 30 Premier League away games against Arsenal (D11 L18), and are winless in 12 since a 3-2 victory in November 2010.
WHAT A SAVE! Saka's deep cross picks out Jesus at the back post, and the Brazil international fires towards goal first time. The effort is from a difficult angle but looks to be flying in, until Vicario manages to palm it wide.
Udogie takes out Saka and receives a booking.
Odegaard is given a yellow card for dissent.
Vicario makes another big stop as Nketiah latches onto Udogie's misplaced pass, beating away the striker's powerful effort from a tight angle.
Porro fires a dangerous delivery across the face of goal, but White is well-placed to make a vital intervention and prevent Son tapping in at the back post.
This is the first time that the North London derby has featured just one player aged 30+ across both starting line-ups in the Premier League since March 2016.
The Gunners have probably shaded the opening period of this game, which is yet to really get going.
No player has had fewer touches than Son so far in this match (two). Spurs' key attacking players have not really been in this game to this point, though the same could be said for Arsenal's.
GOAL!!! ARSENAL ARE AHEAD!!! It comes from a huge slice of luck as Saka cuts onto his left foot before curling towards goal from outside the box. The ball looks to be heading wide, but Romero's block inadvertently sends the ball in a different direction, completely wrongfooting Vicario and flying in to put the Gunners 1-0 up!
How will the visitors respond to falling behind? They have to get their big players more into the game, with Maddison and Son yet to make a real impact.
Van de Ven makes an important intervention to head behind and deny Saka adding a second at the back post.
BIG CHANCE! Jesus spurns a golden opportunity to put his team 2-0 up. After receiving the ball from Vicario in his own box, Maddison is caught in possession by Jesus. However, the Arsenal man cannot punish Maddison's error as he blazes over from a position where he really should have hit the target at least.
Arsenal have been on top since the opening goal, and Arteta will be keen for his side to score a second to further tighten their grip on this game.
Romero is the fourth Tottenham player to score an own goal against North London rivals Arsenal in the Premier League, after Chris Armstrong, Kevin Wimmer, and Hugo Lloris - all four of these own goals put the Gunners 1-0 ahead.
Space opens up for Odegaard to let fly from outside the box, but he cannot replicate his brilliant long-range strike against PSV in midweek as Vicario makes an easy save.
WHAT A SAVE!!! Raya preserves his side's lead with a quite brilliant stop. Son cuts the ball back for Johnson, and the former Nottingham Forest man's first-time shot looks to be flying into the back of the net to level. However, Raya somehow leaps to his right and claws the ball away from danger.
Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 38 Premier League games when they have scored the opening goal (won 34, drawn four) since a 2-1 defeat to Manchester City in January 2022.
GOAL!!! SON LEVELS FOR SPURS!!! Having just seen a close-range effort denied by Raya, the Arsenal goalkeeper has no chance with the forward's second attempt. The visitors recycle the ball and Maddison cuts the ball back for Son, before the South Korea international keeps his composure to turn in and make it 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium!
Maddison laid the ball back for Son to place into the far corner.
Spurs have conceded the opening goal in each of their previous two Premier League games, despite going on to win both games. Can they come back to take three points again here?
There will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Sarr receives a booking for cynically pulling back Jesus as the Gunners looked to counter.
Bissouma is then given a yellow card for dissent.
Excluding penalties, Son has either scored (five) or assisted (two) seven of Tottenham's last nine Premier League goals against Arsenal.
HALF-TIME: ARSENAL 1-1 TOTTENHAM
The two sets of players head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal went ahead in the 26th minute, Saka cutting in and shooting on his left foot before Romero's attempt to block inadvertently sent the ball flying into the back of his own net. It appeared the Gunners would take a lead into the break, but Spurs levelled with just three minutes of normal time left of the first half as Son coolly finished from Maddison's cutback.
The North London derby is finely poised at one apiece, and both managers will be keen to kick on and win this game to secure the bragging rights for their fans. Which player will step up and be the hero and write themselves into their club's folklore?
Arteta makes a pair of changes at the interval. The first sees Havertz come on for Vieira.
Rice makes way for Jorginho.
The hosts get us back underway for the second period.
Arteta has won all three of his home league games against Tottenham as Arsenal manager – only Terry Neill between 1977 and 1980 won each of his first four home North London derby matches in charge of the Gunners.
Arsenal scream for a penalty as a White shot from a corner comes off the arm of Romero. His arm is away from his body but the shot comes from close range. VAR takes a look and sends the referee to the monitor...
PENALTY!!! Referee Jones takes a look at the pitchside monitor, and after viewing the incident, he points to the spot! Arsenal will have a golden opportunity to get their noses back in front...
GOAL!!! SAKA MAKES NO MISTAKE FROM THE SPOT!!! The winger keeps his composure from 12 yards, coolly stroking down the middle as Vicario dives to his right. Arsenal are 2-1 up!!!
GOAL!!! SPURS ARE LEVEL!!! Just moments after Saka put Arsenal back in front, Son scores his second of the game to equalise and send the visiting fans into rapturous celebrations! Jorginho gives the ball away and is ruthlessly punished, as Maddison lays it to his right for Son, who places past Raya and in to make it 2-2!!!
Maddison's pass was perfectly weighted for Son to fire home his second.
Havertz is booked for a late challenge on Son.
Son is the first Spurs player to score two goals away at Arsenal in the Premier League since John Hendry in May 1993.
Johnson goes down and it looks like his race is run as he looks over to the sidelines with a troubled look.
Johnson does indeed limp off, with Solomon on to take his place.
No player has more assists in the Premier League this season than Maddison (four).
Nketiah goes in the book for a really poor challenge on Vicario.
Kulusevski slides a brilliant pass through for Son, but the forward cannot secure his hat-trick as his shot from a tight angle flies into the side netting.
Maddison goes down and clutches at his knee, and though it does not look good initially, the midfielder gets back to his feet and will try to soldier on.
The crowd noise goes up a notch inside the Emirates as Arsenal win a corner, but Vicario does well to claim the resulting delivery before a lurking Arsenal attacker can turn goalwards.
Romero goes in the book for an infringement as the two sets of players wait for a corner to come over.
Jesus makes way for Nelson.
Postecoglou also looks to his bench, first bringing on Hojbjerg for Maddison.
Son will not get his hat-trick as he is replaced by Richarlison.
With 10 minutes to play, can either of these sides find a winner? Both have struggled to really get on top since the equaliser.
There were just 98 seconds between Saka's penalty and Son's equaliser.
Nelson cuts onto his right foot and tries to smash goalwards, but Romero races out to make an important block. Arsenal will have a corner, though.
Spurs just about deal with two corners in quick succession, though Arsenal win a throw-in high up the pitch and will look to keep the pressure on.
The ball sits up nicely for Havertz to lash towards Vicario's goal from outside the area, but he gets his effort horribly wrong and the ball flies high and wide of the target.
There is a brief injury worry for Arsenal as Saka goes down under an Udogie challenge, though the winger quickly gets back to his feet, much to his team's relief.
A roar goes up around the Emirates Stadium as 10 minutes of additional time are announced.
Vicario gets down to his right to tip Saka's shot wide at full stretch. Arsenal are looking the more likely side to find a winner at the moment.
The Gunners win the ball high up the pitch, but they cannot take advantage as Havertz is shepherded out of play by Romero.
There has been seven yellow cards in this match - more than in each of the previous six Premier League meetings between these two sides.
Smith Rowe comes on for Saka in the latter stages.
Arsenal are the side pressing, though they are struggling to break through a Spurs side looking pretty content to settle for a point.
FULL-TIME: ARSENAL 2-2 TOTTENHAM
The final whistle blows and the spoils are shared as the North London derby ends 2-2 at the Emirates Stadium. Arsenal were pegged back twice, first going ahead through Romero's own goal from Saka's curling effort before Son coolly turned home from Maddison's cutback to level. The Gunners went in front again after the interval, Saka keeping his cool to score from the spot after Romero was penalised for a handball after White's close-range effort struck his outstretched arm. The hosts were denied victory, though, as Son slotted home from Maddison's neat assist with both sides unable to find a late winner.
The draw means Spurs remain above Arsenal on goal difference, both on 14 points after strong starts to the season, with Postecoglou's men dropping to fourth and the Gunners down to fifth after Brighton's win at home to Bournemouth. Arteta's side are in EFL Cup action next, travelling to take on Brentford on Wednesday as they bid to progress through to the next round. Spurs' next game comes at home to Liverpool in the Premier League next weekend.
Thanks for joining us for live coverage of the 2-2 draw between Arsenal and Tottenham at the Emirates Stadium. Goodbye!"	"Fulham claimed a third win of the season and their first in three matches as they beat bottom side Sheffield United 3-1. 
The home side dominated the opening stages but suffered familiar problems in front of goal with Fulham having only scored five times going into the match. 
Bobby De Cordova-Reid almost found the opener but good defending from Aaron Trusty prevented him from converting Antonee Robinson’s cross. Then Sheff Utd goalkeeper Wes Foderingham did well to deny Willian from close range. 
Sheff Utd suffered a big blow when captain Chris Basham had to go off midway through the first half with a serious-looking ankle injury. 
Oliver McBurnie headed straight at Bernd Leno from a corner after half-time and the Blades were made to pay for missing that chance as De Cordova-Reid opened the scoring in the 53rd minute. 
Fulham broke from the back and a sweeping move was finished off by De Cordova-Reid for his first goal since the opening weekend. 
However Sheff Utd soon pulled level, as Robinson diverted Yasser Larouci’s cross into his own net.
Fulham retook the lead in bizarre fashion. They won the ball in midfield and Tom Cairney slipped as he shot and the ball struck his standing foot and looped over Foderingham to hit the bar before going in off the back of the Sheff Utd goalkeeper. 
A stoppage time strike from Willian sealed Marco Silva’s 50th win in charge of Fulham.
Fulham climb to 12th with 11 points, while Sheff Utd remain bottom with only one point.

Referee: Sam Barrott. Assistants: Simon Bennett, Dan Robathan. Fourth official: Anthony Taylor. VAR: Paul Tierney. Assistant VAR: Scott Ledger."	Team_10		"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the North London derby between Team_1 and Team_18 at the Emirates Stadium.
These fierce rivals meet in the Premier League for the first time this season, the latest edition of a derby that seems to always produce thrilling encounters. The Gunners currently hold the bragging rights, finishing 24 points and six places above Spurs last term while winning both of the meetings between the sides, and they have enjoyed another strong start to this campaign, currently unbeaten and in the top four.
The Ange Postecoglou era at Spurs has had a brilliant opening, with the former Celtic boss taking four wins from his first five Premier League games in charge to put his new side second in the standings. This is their biggest test yet, though, so it will be interesting to see how Postecoglou's side fare.
Team_1 (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Fabio Vieira; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Eddie Nketiah.
SUBS: Reiss Nelson, Emile Smith Rowe, Kai Havertz, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jorginho, Jakub Kiwior, Mohamed Elneny.
Team_18 (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Pape Sarr, Yves Bissouma; Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Son Heung-min; Brennan Johnson.
SUBS: Fraser Forster, Eric Dier, Alejo Veliz, Ben Davies, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Oliver Skipp, Richarlison, Manor Solomon, Emerson.
Mikel Arteta makes two changes from the side that hammered PSV 4-0 in midweek as Vieira and Nketiah come in for Havertz and Leandro Trossard, the latter of whom misses out altogether after picking up a knock in training. Gabriel Martinelli is also absent as Raya retains his place between the sticks.
Postecoglou goes with just the one alteration from the starting XI that came back in dramatic fashion to beat Team_17 last time out as Johnson makes his full debut, with Solomon dropping to the bench. Ivan Perisic suffered a serious knee injury in training and looks like he will miss the rest of the season.
The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of the North London derby!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way!
NO GOAL! Team_18 have an early strike ruled out as Bissouma's shot is turned home by Son from close range, with the flag immediately going up for offside.
The big challenges are flying in already, exactly what you would expect from such a heated derby. Which side will keep their heads the better?
Romero is perhaps fortunate to avoid a booking as he crunches through the back of Jesus in midfield. The referee Robert Jones opts to keep his cards in his pockets.
Team_1 have won four of their last five Premier League games against Team_18 (one loss), as many victories as they had in their previous 16 against them beforehand.
The game is yet to get into a real rhythm with lots of scrappy fouls disrupting the flow. The referee has been a busy man so far.
Team_18 have won just one of their last 30 Premier League away games against Team_1 (D11 L18), and are winless in 12 since a 3-2 victory in November 2010.
WHAT A SAVE! Saka's deep cross picks out Jesus at the back post, and the Brazil international fires towards goal first time. The effort is from a difficult angle but looks to be flying in, until Vicario manages to palm it wide.
Udogie takes out Saka and receives a booking.
Odegaard is given a yellow card for dissent.
Vicario makes another big stop as Nketiah latches onto Udogie's misplaced pass, beating away the striker's powerful effort from a tight angle.
Porro fires a dangerous delivery across the face of goal, but White is well-placed to make a vital intervention and prevent Son tapping in at the back post.
This is the first time that the North London derby has featured just one player aged 30+ across both starting line-ups in the Premier League since March 2016.
The Gunners have probably shaded the opening period of this game, which is yet to really get going.
No player has had fewer touches than Son so far in this match (two). Spurs' key attacking players have not really been in this game to this point, though the same could be said for Team_1.
GOAL!!! Team_1 ARE AHEAD!!! It comes from a huge slice of luck as Saka cuts onto his left foot before curling towards goal from outside the box. The ball looks to be heading wide, but Romero's block inadvertently sends the ball in a different direction, completely wrongfooting Vicario and flying in to put the Gunners 1-0 up!
How will the visitors respond to falling behind? They have to get their big players more into the game, with Maddison and Son yet to make a real impact.
Van de Ven makes an important intervention to head behind and deny Saka adding a second at the back post.
BIG CHANCE! Jesus spurns a golden opportunity to put his team 2-0 up. After receiving the ball from Vicario in his own box, Maddison is caught in possession by Jesus. However, the Team_1 man cannot punish Maddison's error as he blazes over from a position where he really should have hit the target at least.
Team_1 have been on top since the opening goal, and Arteta will be keen for his side to score a second to further tighten their grip on this game.
Romero is the fourth Team_18 player to score an own goal against North London rivals Team_1 in the Premier League, after Chris Armstrong, Kevin Wimmer, and Hugo Lloris - all four of these own goals put the Gunners 1-0 ahead.
Space opens up for Odegaard to let fly from outside the box, but he cannot replicate his brilliant long-range strike against PSV in midweek as Vicario makes an easy save.
WHAT A SAVE!!! Raya preserves his side's lead with a quite brilliant stop. Son cuts the ball back for Johnson, and the former Team_16 man's first-time shot looks to be flying into the back of the net to level. However, Raya somehow leaps to his right and claws the ball away from danger.
Team_1 are unbeaten in their last 38 Premier League games when they have scored the opening goal (won 34, drawn four) since a 2-1 defeat to Team_13 in January 2022.
GOAL!!! SON LEVELS FOR SPURS!!! Having just seen a close-range effort denied by Raya, the Team_1 goalkeeper has no chance with the forward's second attempt. The visitors recycle the ball and Maddison cuts the ball back for Son, before the South Korea international keeps his composure to turn in and make it 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium!
Maddison laid the ball back for Son to place into the far corner.
Spurs have conceded the opening goal in each of their previous two Premier League games, despite going on to win both games. Can they come back to take three points again here?
There will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Sarr receives a booking for cynically pulling back Jesus as the Gunners looked to counter.
Bissouma is then given a yellow card for dissent.
Excluding penalties, Son has either scored (five) or assisted (two) seven of Team_18 last nine Premier League goals against Team_1.
HALF-TIME: Team_1 1-1 Team_18
The two sets of players head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium. Team_1 went ahead in the 26th minute, Saka cutting in and shooting on his left foot before Romero's attempt to block inadvertently sent the ball flying into the back of his own net. It appeared the Gunners would take a lead into the break, but Spurs levelled with just three minutes of normal time left of the first half as Son coolly finished from Maddison's cutback.
The North London derby is finely poised at one apiece, and both managers will be keen to kick on and win this game to secure the bragging rights for their fans. Which player will step up and be the hero and write themselves into their club's folklore?
Arteta makes a pair of changes at the interval. The first sees Havertz come on for Vieira.
Rice makes way for Jorginho.
The hosts get us back underway for the second period.
Arteta has won all three of his home league games against Team_18 as Team_1 manager – only Terry Neill between 1977 and 1980 won each of his first four home North London derby matches in charge of the Gunners.

Arteta's side are in EFL Cup action next, travelling to take on Team_4 on Wednesday as they bid to progress through to the next round. Spurs' next game comes at home to Team_11 in the Premier League next weekend.

93424	Fulham	Man Utd	2023-11-04	Craven Cottage, London	24415.0	John Brooks	"Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Chelsea and Arsenal at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea return to action after the international break aiming to continue their momentum, having posted three straight wins in all competitions. After a difficult start to the campaign, Mauricio Pochettino and his men found life with a win over Brighton in the EFL Cup before defeating Fulham and Burnley in the Premier League. Another victory over Arsenal would signal that the Blues are starting to find their form under the Argentine.
Arsenal would not have wanted the international break to come after securing a huge win over Manchester City on matchday eight. Gabriel Martinelli struck late in the game at the Emirates Stadium to end the Gunners' poor run of form against the champions. It could be a result that Mikel Arteta and his team look back on as a key moment in the title race come the end of the term. Now, they must retain their focus against the Blues, who they have won six of their last seven games against. Another victory would allow them to sustain their momentum and send them to the top of the table.
CHELSEA (4-3-3): Robert Sanchez; Malo Gusto, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Marc Cucurella; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez; Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk.
CHELSEA SUBS: Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Chimuanya Ugochukwu, Reece James, Dorde Petrovic, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.
ARSENAL SUBS: Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Reiss Nelson, Kai Havertz, Karl Hein.
Chelsea have made two changes to the side that beat Burnley 4-1 last time out. Gusto missed that game due to suspension and gets the nod to return at right-back ahead of Disasi. Armando Broja is out with a knee injury and is replaced by Mudryk in the final third. Captain James is back on the bench after recovering from a hamstring injury.
Arsenal have made two changes to their side following their win over Manchester City last time out. Saka returns from injury to take his place on the right flank as he replaces Trossard, who drops to the bench. Martinelli also comes back into the starting lineup in place of Nketiah.
The players are out on the pitch, so we should be under way shortly.
We're under way at Stamford Bridge.
CHANCE! Chelsea put early pressure on the visitors as Zinchenko fails to clear. Gallagher sees two efforts charged down before Fernandez latches onto a loose ball and curls his effort over the top.

VAR! PENALTY TO CHELSEA! After looking at the screen at the side of the field, the referee overturns his initial decision and awards a penalty.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! PALMER CONVERTS!!!!! 1-0 CHELSEA!!!!! The Blues take the lead as Palmer holds his composure and buries his spot-kick. Palmer places his effort low into the left side of the net and Raya dives the wrong way. Chelsea break the deadlock.
Palmer's goal has ended Arsenal's run of 335 minutes without conceding away from home.
Rice is played into space down the left flank by Odegaard and he presses inside the box. He opts for a cross with the outside of his boot that flashes across the face of goal with no red shirt there to convert.
Odegaard looks to release Jesus in the final third, but he overhits his throughball out for a goal-kick. Arsenal are not clicking at the moment.
Martinelli was caught in the build-up to Odegaard's misplaced pass by Thiago Silva. He takes his time to get up after being caught on the leg.
Jesus beats Sanchez in a footrace to the ball down the right flank. He tries to force an effort towards an empty net, but Chelsea get men back behind the ball to thwart the Gunners. Jorginho does have time to fire towards goal, but he opts for a pass instead.
BLOCK! White forces a low ball into the feet of Jesus in the Chelsea box. He shoots on the turn, only to see his effort diverted behind by Thiago Silva.
INCHES WIDE! Palmer latches onto a throughball from Gallagher and fires a left-footed strike early through the legs of Gabriel and just wide of the right post.
Arsenal are struggling to make an impact in the final third. There's no fluency to their play at the moment.
Chelsea have been on their game since kick-off and their early press on the Gunners has given them confidence to dominate the midfield.
Caicedo, Fernandez and Gallagher are winning the battle in the middle of the park. There's plenty of energy out there for the Blues.
Gallagher latches onto Fernandez's header in the box and turns to shoot, only to see his effort saved by Raya. The offside flag goes up late anyway.
Odegaard is not on his game. He collects an offload from Jorginho, but sends his first-time pass the wrong side of Jesus.
Chelsea have an important few minutes ahead of them before the break. They've been excellent in the first half and now need to see out their advantage until the whistle.
OVER! Palmer turns the ball around the corner for Sterling and he surges down the right flank. He cuts a pass back to Gusto in support, but he sends his left-footed effort over the top.
Thiago Silva brings down Jesus and goes into the book.
Rice is caught offside from Odegaard's pass from the resulting free-kick. It has not been Arsenal's half.
There will be two minutes of added time.
Fernandez gets forward in support in the final third and lines up a curling strike that Raya claims with ease.
HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 1-0 ARSENAL
Chelsea lead Arsenal 1-0 at the break in their Premier League clash. Cole Palmer scored from the penalty spot after referee Chris Kavanagh was advised to overturn his initial decision to not award a spot-kick following a handball by William Saliba in the box. The Blues have been the better side and the Gunners have been off the pace from kick-off at Stamford Bridge. An important 45 minutes awaits both sides.
Mikel Arteta will not be happy with his side at the break. They've been lacklustre in and out of possession and have failed to threaten Robert Sanchez's goal. The Gunners need a response in the second half to maintain their unbeaten record.
Zinchenko makes way for Tomiyasu at the break.
We're back under way at Stamford Bridge.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! MUDRYK CATCHES RAYA COLD!!!!!!! 2-0 CHELSEA!!!!!!!! The Blues double their lead as Mudryk catches Raya off balance at the near post as his attempted cross finds the back of the net. Chelsea break with numbers down the left flank and Gallagher feeds the Ukraine international. He looks for Sterling at the back post, but his cross soars over Raya and into the back of the net.
Gallagher feeds Mudryk down the left flank and the winger does the rest as his cross finds the net.
Mudryk is just the second Ukrainian to score against Arsenal in the Premier League, and first since Sergiy Rebrov for Tottenham in December 2000.
Arsenal are struggling to compete in the middle of the park. Chelsea are winning the 50/50 battles across the pitch and have a deserved two-goal lead.
WIDE! Martinelli cuts inside from the left flank and aims a strike towards the far corner, but his effort is deflected wide of the target by Thiago Silva.
Sanchez flaps at a corner from Odegaard and Arsenal are able to send another set-piece into the box. Gabriel meets the delivery from Martinelli at the back post, but he sends his headed effort wide.
Arsenal win another corner down the left flank, which is cleared as far as Jorginho. He sees his effort blocked before Tomiyasu places his follow-up over the top.
CLOSE! Raya almost makes another terrible mistake at the back as he places a pass straight to Palmer. The goalkeeper manages to recover to block his effort wide of the target. The Arsenal shot-stopper is all over the place!
Colwill heads over in an offside position from the resulting corner. Arsenal are so nervy at the back.
Sanchez is not much better at the other end for the Blues! He comes miles off his line to attack a free-kick from Odegaard and gets nowhere near the ball, clattering Colwill and Jesus in the process.
The two 'keepers are not covering themselves in glory today. Raya's mistake has cost Arsenal, while Sanchez is treading a fine line in the Chelsea net.
Martinelli twists and turns down the left flank and lifts a cross to the back post that Cucurella heads behind.
Mudryk got a tad lucky with his goal, but he deserved it after a tireless performance. He makes way for Jackson.
Sterling releases Jackson one-on-one with Raya, but the Arsenal 'keeper holds his ground and smothers the ball at his feet.
Jesus is replaced by Nketiah in the final third for the Gunners.
Jorginho has been fairy ineffectual and is replaced by Smith Rowe in the Arsenal midfield.
Chelsea keep the pressure on as Sterling tries to force an effort towards goal, but Saliba holds his ground. Palmer then tries to bend an attempt from distance, only to send his strike wide.
Cucurella brings down Saka on the charge and goes into the book.
Chelsea have been dogged at the back and have not allowed the Gunners to sustain a period of pressure. Arteta's men have not been able to register a shot on target.
This is the first time that Chelsea have scored two or more goals in three consecutive league games since October 2022 (run of four).
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! A SANCHEZ MISTAKE HANDS RICE A SIMPLE GOAL!!!!!! 2-1!!!! Arsenal are back in the game as Rice capitalises on an error from Sanchez to fire home. Sanchez misplaces a simple pass out from the back to Rice, who takes on his strike first-time and finds the bottom-left corner. A lifeline for the Gunners out of nowhere!
Odegaard is withdrawn by Arteta and is replaced by the former Chelsea man Havertz.
Trossard enters the action for Martinelli in the final third.
We're heading towards a thrilling final 10 minutes at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have been in complete control, but Sanchez's mistake has given Arsenal hope.
Rice's goal was Arsenal's first shot on target in the game.
James is on for Palmer for the final six minutes.
Madueke replaces Sterling in the final third for the hosts.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! TROSSARD EQUALISES!!!!! 2-2!!!!!!! Arsenal level the scores as Trossard steers Saka's cross home at the back post! Saka is afforded space and time to sweep a dangerous ball to the back post from the right flank. Trossard times his run to perfection and pokes the ball past Sanchez. The travelling fans are going wild behind that goal, we're level again!
Saka puts the ball on a plate for Trossard at the back post with a precise left-footed cross.
INCHES WIDE! White floats a ball over the top for Nketiah to chase in the inside-right channel. He connects on his right foot and fires his effort across goal, but it trickles inches wide of the left post.
Arsenal are winning all the 50-50 battles on the pitch now and are pressing for a winner. Arteta's men have dug out an equaliser, but can they get more?
Nketiah catches Caicedo on the boot and he goes into the book.
There will be seven minutes of added time.
White goes into the book for the visitors, having fouled Madueke.
Arsenal have scored five goals via substitutes in the Premier League this season, only Brighton (seven) have scored more.
Jackson makes a burst down the right flank. He finds space to break into the box and shoots low and hard, but Raya makes a solid stop.
There's still time for a winner. Can either side force the issue?
FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 2-2 ARSENAL
Arsenal come from behind to maintain their unbeaten record in the Premier League this season, securing a 2-2 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The Blues went ahead from the penalty spot through Cole Palmer after the VAR adjudged that William Saliba had handled the ball in the box. Mykhailo Mudryk then capitalised on a mistake from David Raya to put his side two goals to the good as his cross found the net. But, Chelsea 'keeper Robert Sanchez made an error of his own to allow Declan Rice to bring Arsenal back into the game before Leandro Trossard converted Bukayo Saka's cross at the back post to earn the Gunners a share of the spoils. Chelsea return to action next Saturday against Brentford at home in the Premier League, while Arsenal travel to face Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday. Thanks for joining us today, until next time, goodbye."

United thought they had claimed an early opening goal, but Scott McTominay’s finish at the back post from a free-kick in the eighth minute was ruled out for offside after a VAR review as Harry Maguire was deemed offside.
In a match of few chances, Andre Onana made an important second-half save from Harry Wilson before then parrying a fierce effort from Palhinha. The match looked to be heading towards stalemate when, on his 200th appearance for the club, Fernandes became the hero.
Fulham had three chances to clear the ball but instead it fell to the United captain, who showed great skills to turn defenders before driving a low shot past a despairing dive from Bernd Leno. 
A third consecutive away win, and a seventh victory in a row by a single goal means United climb up to seventh on 18 points.
Fulham’s third consecutive defeat at home leaves them 14th on 12 points and they extended their winless run against United in all competitions to 18 matches, drawing three and losing 15.

Team_7 return to action after the international break aiming to continue their momentum, having posted three straight wins in all competitions. After a difficult start to the campaign, Mauricio Pochettino and his men found life with a win over Team_5 in the EFL Cup before defeating Team_10 and Team_6 in the Premier League. Another victory over Team_1 would signal that the Blues are starting to find their form under the Argentine.
Team_1 would not have wanted the international break to come after securing a huge win over Team_13 on matchday eight. Gabriel Martinelli struck late in the game at the Emirates Stadium to end the Gunners' poor run of form against the champions. It could be a result that Mikel Arteta and his team look back on as a key moment in the title race come the end of the term. Now, they must retain their focus against the Blues, who they have won six of their last seven games against. Another victory would allow them to sustain their momentum and send them to the top of the table.
Team_7 (4-3-3): Robert Sanchez; Malo Gusto, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Marc Cucurella; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez; Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling, Mykhailo Mudryk.
Team_7 SUBS: Axel Disasi, Benoit Badiashile, Noni Madueke, Nicolas Jackson, Chimuanya Ugochukwu, Reece James, Dorde Petrovic, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington.
Team_1 (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Jorginho, Declan Rice; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.
Team_1 SUBS: Thomas Partey, Emile Smith Rowe, Eddie Nketiah, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Reiss Nelson, Kai Havertz, Karl Hein.
Team_7 have made two changes to the side that beat Team_6 4-1 last time out. Gusto missed that game due to suspension and gets the nod to return at right-back ahead of Disasi. Armando Broja is out with a knee injury and is replaced by Mudryk in the final third. Captain James is back on the bench after recovering from a hamstring injury.
Team_1 have made two changes to their side following their win over Team_13 last time out. Saka returns from injury to take his place on the right flank as he replaces Trossard, who drops to the bench. Martinelli also comes back into the starting lineup in place of Nketiah.
The players are out on the pitch, so we should be under way shortly.
We're under way at Stamford Bridge.

The Blues have made a settled start to the contest in their bid to disrupt Team_1 possession game.
Saka has a run at Cucurellla down the right flank, but the Team_7 defender holds well up and draws a foul.
Palmer catches Jesus on the ankle with an outstretched boot and goes into the book.
Palmer goes down under pressure from Rice in the middle of the park. Team_7 get the free-kick, but there's no further action from the referee.
Colwill slips and almost allows Odegaard to pounce, but the Blues get men back to crowd out the Team_1 skipper before he can strike at goal.
Zinchenko brings down Mudryk with a loose challenge and goes into the book.
PENALTY SHOUT! Mudryk attacks a cross from the right flank that strikes Saliba on the arm. The referee shakes his head, but the decision will be looked at again by the VAR!
VAR! PENALTY TO Team_7! After looking at the screen at the side of the field, the referee overturns his initial decision and awards a penalty.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! PALMER CONVERTS!!!!! 1-0 Team_7!!!!! The Blues take the lead as Palmer holds his composure and buries his spot-kick. Palmer places his effort low into the left side of the net and Raya dives the wrong way. Team_7 break the deadlock.
Palmer's goal has ended Team_1 run of 335 minutes without conceding away from home.
Rice is played into space down the left flank by Odegaard and he presses inside the box. He opts for a cross with the outside of his boot that flashes across the face of goal with no red shirt there to convert.
Odegaard looks to release Jesus in the final third, but he overhits his throughball out for a goal-kick. Team_1 are not clicking at the moment.
Martinelli was caught in the build-up to Odegaard's misplaced pass by Thiago Silva. He takes his time to get up after being caught on the leg.
Jesus beats Sanchez in a footrace to the ball down the right flank. He tries to force an effort towards an empty net, but Team_7 get men back behind the ball to thwart the Gunners. Jorginho does have time to fire towards goal, but he opts for a pass instead.
BLOCK! White forces a low ball into the feet of Jesus in the Team_7 box. He shoots on the turn, only to see his effort diverted behind by Thiago Silva.
INCHES WIDE! Palmer latches onto a throughball from Gallagher and fires a left-footed strike early through the legs of Gabriel and just wide of the right post.
Team_1 are struggling to make an impact in the final third. There's no fluency to their play at the moment.
Team_7 have been on their game since kick-off and their early press on the Gunners has given them confidence to dominate the midfield.
Caicedo, Fernandez and Gallagher are winning the battle in the middle of the park. There's plenty of energy out there for the Blues.
Gallagher latches onto Fernandez's header in the box and turns to shoot, only to see his effort saved by Raya. The offside flag goes up late anyway.
Odegaard is not on his game. He collects an offload from Jorginho, but sends his first-time pass the wrong side of Jesus.
Team_7 have an important few minutes ahead of them before the break. They've been excellent in the first half and now need to see out their advantage until the whistle.
OVER! Palmer turns the ball around the corner for Sterling and he surges down the right flank. He cuts a pass back to Gusto in support, but he sends his left-footed effort over the top.
Thiago Silva brings down Jesus and goes into the book.
Rice is caught offside from Odegaard's pass from the resulting free-kick. It has not been Team_1 half.
There will be two minutes of added time.
Fernandez gets forward in support in the final third and lines up a curling strike that Raya claims with ease.
HALF-TIME: Team_7 1-0 Team_1
Team_7 lead Team_1 1-0 at the break in their Premier League clash. Cole Palmer scored from the penalty spot after referee Chris Kavanagh was advised to overturn his initial decision to not award a spot-kick following a handball by William Saliba in the box. The Blues have been the better side and the Gunners have been off the pace from kick-off at Stamford Bridge. An important 45 minutes awaits both sides.
Mikel Arteta will not be happy with his side at the break. They've been lacklustre in and out of possession and have failed to threaten Robert Sanchez's goal. The Gunners need a response in the second half to maintain their unbeaten record.
Zinchenko makes way for Tomiyasu at the break.
We're back under way at Stamford Bridge.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! MUDRYK CATCHES RAYA COLD!!!!!!! 2-0 Team_7!!!!!!!! The Blues double their lead as Mudryk catches Raya off balance at the near post as his attempted cross finds the back of the net. Team_7 break with numbers down the left flank and Gallagher feeds the Ukraine international. He looks for Sterling at the back post, but his cross soars over Raya and into the back of the net.
Gallagher feeds Mudryk down the left flank and the winger does the rest as his cross finds the net.
Mudryk is just the second Ukrainian to score against Team_1 in the Premier League, and first since Sergiy Rebrov for Team_18 in December 2000.
Team_1 are struggling to compete in the middle of the park. Team_7 are winning the 50/50 battles across the pitch and have a deserved two-goal lead.
WIDE! Martinelli cuts inside from the left flank and aims a strike towards the far corner, but his effort is deflected wide of the target by Thiago Silva.
Sanchez flaps at a corner from Odegaard and Team_1 are able to send another set-piece into the box. Gabriel meets the delivery from Martinelli at the back post, but he sends his headed effort wide.
Team_1 win another corner down the left flank, which is cleared as far as Jorginho. He sees his effort blocked before Tomiyasu places his follow-up over the top.
CLOSE! Raya almost makes another terrible mistake at the back as he places a pass straight to Palmer. The goalkeeper manages to recover to block his effort wide of the target. The Team_1 shot-stopper is all over the place!
Colwill heads over in an offside position from the resulting corner. Team_1 are so nervy at the back.
Sanchez is not much better at the other end for the Blues! He comes miles off his line to attack a free-kick from Odegaard and gets nowhere near the ball, clattering Colwill and Jesus in the process.
The two 'keepers are not covering themselves in glory today. Raya's mistake has cost Team_1, while Sanchez is treading a fine line in the Team_7 net.
Martinelli twists and turns down the left flank and lifts a cross to the back post that Cucurella heads behind.
Mudryk got a tad lucky with his goal, but he deserved it after a tireless performance. He makes way for Jackson.
Sterling releases Jackson one-on-one with Raya, but the Team_1 'keeper holds his ground and smothers the ball at his feet.
Jesus is replaced by Nketiah in the final third for the Gunners.
Jorginho has been fairy ineffectual and is replaced by Smith Rowe in the Team_1 midfield.
Team_7 keep the pressure on as Sterling tries to force an effort towards goal, but Saliba holds his ground. Palmer then tries to bend an attempt from distance, only to send his strike wide.
Cucurella brings down Saka on the charge and goes into the book.
Team_7 have been dogged at the back and have not allowed the Gunners to sustain a period of pressure. Arteta's men have not been able to register a shot on target.
This is the first time that Team_7 have scored two or more goals in three consecutive league games since October 2022 (run of four).
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! A SANCHEZ MISTAKE HANDS RICE A SIMPLE GOAL!!!!!! 2-1!!!! Team_1 are back in the game as Rice capitalises on an error from Sanchez to fire home. Sanchez misplaces a simple pass out from the back to Rice, who takes on his strike first-time and finds the bottom-left corner. A lifeline for the Gunners out of nowhere!
Odegaard is withdrawn by Arteta and is replaced by the former Team_7 man Havertz.
Trossard enters the action for Martinelli in the final third.
We're heading towards a thrilling final 10 minutes at Stamford Bridge. Team_7 have been in complete control, but Sanchez's mistake has given Team_1 hope.
Rice's goal was Team_1 first shot on target in the game.
James is on for Palmer for the final six minutes.
Madueke replaces Sterling in the final third for the hosts.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! TROSSARD EQUALISES!!!!! 2-2!!!!!!! Team_1 level the scores as Trossard steers Saka's cross home at the back post! Saka is afforded space and time to sweep a dangerous ball to the back post from the right flank. Trossard times his run to perfection and pokes the ball past Sanchez. The travelling fans are going wild behind that goal, we're level again!
Saka puts the ball on a plate for Trossard at the back post with a precise left-footed cross.
INCHES WIDE! White floats a ball over the top for Nketiah to chase in the inside-right channel. He connects on his right foot and fires his effort across goal, but it trickles inches wide of the left post.
Team_1 are winning all the 50-50 battles on the pitch now and are pressing for a winner. Arteta's men have dug out an equaliser, but can they get more?
Nketiah catches Caicedo on the boot and he goes into the book.
There will be seven minutes of added time.
White goes into the book for the visitors, having fouled Madueke.
Team_1 have scored five goals via substitutes in the Premier League this season, only Team_5 (seven) have scored more.
Jackson makes a burst down the right flank. He finds space to break into the box and shoots low and hard, but Raya makes a solid stop.
There's still time for a winner. Can either side force the issue?
FULL-TIME: Team_7 2-2 Team_1
Team_1 come from behind to maintain their unbeaten record in the Premier League this season, securing a 2-2 draw against Team_7 at Stamford Bridge. The Blues went ahead from the penalty spot through Cole Palmer after the VAR adjudged that William Saliba had handled the ball in the box. Mykhailo Mudryk then capitalised on a mistake from David Raya to put his side two goals to the good as his cross found the net. But, Team_7 'keeper Robert Sanchez made an error of his own to allow Declan Rice to bring Team_1 back into the game before Leandro Trossard converted Bukayo Saka's cross at the back post to earn the Gunners a share of the spoils. Team_7 return to action next Saturday against Team_4 at home in the Premier League, while Team_1 travel to face Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday.

93634	Everton	Burnley	2024-04-06	Goodison Park, Liverpool	39125.0	Michael Oliver	"Hello and welcome to the live coverage of the Premier League match between Burnley and Wolves!
Sorry Burnley fans but it is fair to say that it hasn’t been a great return to the Premier League so far. That being said they have recently started to show people that they do have the quality to compete and haven’t lost in their last three games, drawing against Chelsea and West Ham and also winning against Brentford. Premier League survival looked unlikely before those three games, but now they are only four points from safety! Are Burnley starting to dream again?
Wolves will be hoping their April has more joy in store than March. They only won once and also got knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Coventry. It has left them with little to fight for as the season reaches its climax but, a win is a win and Gary O’Neil will be desperate for one just to boost his squad's confidence.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): Arijanet Muric; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Maxime Esteve, Charlie Taylor; Jacob Bruun Larsen, Josh Cullen, Sander Berge, Wilson Odobert; David Datro Fofana, Lyle Foster.
SUBSTITUTES: Zeki Amdouni, Josh Brownhill, Jack Cork, Hannes Delcroix, Hjalmar Ekdal, Manuel Benson, Jay Rodriguez, Lawrence Vigouroux.
WOLVES (3-4-2-1) Jose Sa; Matt Doherty, Max Kilman, Toti; Nelson Semedo, Joao Gomes, Hugo Bueno, Rayan Ait-Nouri; Pablo Sarabia, Mario Lemina; Leon Chiwome.
SUBSTITUTES: Ty Barnett, Daniel Bentley, Santiago Bueno, Tawanda Chirewa, Matheus Cunha, Thomas Doyle, Nathan Fraser, Noha Lemina, Boubacar Traore.
Vincent Kompany has made two changes from that impressive draw away at Chelsea on the weekend. Fofana comes back up front after he was ineligible to play against his parent club, which is a huge boost as he is Burnley’s top goal scorer at Turf Moor. He only joined in January! Charlie Taylor replaces Lorenz Assignon who was sent off in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Muric continues in goal and looks to have become the number one, displacing James Trafford. The rest is the same as Kompany looks to build some consistency in his squad in the hope it can guide them closer to safety.
The big news for Wolves is not in the starting line-up but on the bench as Cunha makes his return after missing seven games out. It is a big absence when he isn’t playing so O’Neil will be hoping to see an instant impact from their superstar. Up top for Wolves is 18-year-old Chiwome who made his Premier League debut on the weekend against Aston Villa, and he must have impressed as he is rewarded with another start.
Wolves have not enjoyed travelling to this part of Lancashire. They haven’t won at Turf Moor since 2010, and with Burnley in their best run of form, can Wolves overcome this difficult task? We will find out shortly as kick-off approaches.
KICK-OFF. Turf Moor lets out a roar as Burnley gets us underway, can they continue to build on this unlikely push for Premier League safety?
Muric gets an early touch as he rushes out of his goal to collect Bueno's looping cross.
Fofana and Odobert link up beautifully and the winger finds himself galloping forward but his pass is just behind Bruun Larsen and it kills the attack. Good signs for Burnley at the back and in attack so far.
Sa makes a fearless clearance there. He chucks himself at the ball as Burnley shirts rush towards him but he manages to get there and heads it clear.
Sa is scurrying off his line again to deny Burnley a corner after Odobert's deflected shot was slowly bobbling out of play before the Portuguese slapped it out for a throw-in.
Cullen has a great chance to get the ball into the box from a set piece, but it barely reaches the first man. It was a shocking free-kick.
Wolves have had some big hitters injured this season with Hwang Hee-Chan and Pedro Neto also missing. It means that this starting team has only scored 13 of the 42 league goals they have netted this season. Four of those have come defenders. Yikes!
A bit of last-ditch defending from Wolves here. Burnley found themselves in the box a couple of times but are just unable to either pull the trigger or find a teammate. In comes Toti who smashes it clear.
Wolves have their best spell of possession so far, and O'Shea gets a bit excited and drags Ait-Nouri back to relieve some pressure on the away side.
Confidence is a magical thing. You would believe that Wolves are the team in the depths of a relegation scrap in the opening 17 minutes here. Burnley are playing it around so quickly and with intent as well.
In terms of action on the pitch, there isn't too much to report on, but in the stands, a section of the crowd have had to be moved because of a leak in the roof. The fans who are moving aren't missing too much.
Ait-Nouri is let down by his touch, he just tries to push the ball into space but a heavy touch allows Vitinho to come in and clear the ball.
Doherty tries to go on his own and probably wishes he didn't. He cut in and attempted to whip it but on his weaker foot, it went wide.
Bueno has two attempts to cross the ball but on both occasions can only find claret and blue shirts. They weren't bad balls, Burnley have just been really strong defensively so far in this half.
WOW! WHAT A CHANCE! Doherty sneaks round the back post to send Sarabia's corner back across goal to Gomes but the Brazilian flicks his header wide. He has his head in his hands and you can't blame him.
Muric has really had a huge impact on Burnley's recent form. The goalkeeper has been progressive with his passing, and at times a little bit risky but so far it is working out.
Sarabia nearly found Chiwome rushing through on-goal but the Spaniard takes a loose touch and then plays a poor pass which allows Esteve to intercept. If his touch was tighter Burnley were in danger there.
Gomes has had to get some treatment. It allows Kompany and O'Neil to give some instructions to their teams. Both managers should be pretty happy with this opening 35 minutes so far.
SA SAVES! Vitinho shows some great footwork and drives into the box where the Wolves players almost look a bit scared to touch him. He then shoots but Sa gobbles up the chance, which was a pretty easy stop for him.
Esteve is rescued by the referee's whistle. Wolves looked to have pinched the ball of the defender and Esteve fell to the ground and luckily for him, the whistle blew as Wolves looked to race away.
GOAAAL! BURNLEY LEAD 1-0! It started with the goalkeeper and it ended with Bruun Larsen stoking a fantastic volley into the bottom corner. Sa could do nothing about that and Burnley deserve it!
O'Shea receives the ball of Muric and he just roams into the space and lofts a ball to the back post where Bruun Larsen is waiting to strike a fierce volley to make it 1-0.
Chiwome has a chance to instantly respond. The youngster spins and shoots and it looks goal-bound but it clips his teammate Toti and goes out for a goal kick.
Burnley are looking to get a second before the break. Foster walks into the box but can't find the space to shoot and it is cleared but Cullen is there to keep the pressure on. Wolves stay strong and keep Sa's goal protected.
Chiwome has had a difficult evening so far, but for only his second-ever game in the Premier League he has continued to be busy throughout the opening half. He has just come up against Esteve who has is having a fine game so far.
Cullen finds himself free on the edge of the box and pulls the trigger although it doesn't test Sa at all.
GOAAAL! AIT-NOURI LEVELS IT! He has been so dangerous this half, and he just arrives in the box to cushion a header past Muric. It was such an easy header for the Algerian, and he now has three goals in four games. He has been so important for Wolves recently and he continues to be so as he makes it 1-1.
Sarabia plays a delicate free-kick into a crowd of on-rushing Wolves players and Ait-Nouri directs the cross past Muric to level. After a brief VAR check the goal stands.
Ait-Nouri has been the biggest threat for Wolves so far and wins a free-kick for his side to have one last chance before the break.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 1-1 WOLVES
Well it has been an exciting half, and a difficult one to call as well. Burnley have been playing with a new-found confidence and took the lead with Bruun Larsen's volley. The Clarets had deserved it up until that point with Vitinho testing Sa moments before the opener, but Wolves slowly built their way back into the game. Ait-Nouri has been the away sides brightest spark and stung Burnley late on in the half. He won the free-kick and then met Sarabia's cross with a cushioned header to beat Muric and level the game.
It probably shouldn't have been a surprise that Burnley were picking the ball out of the net in the opening 45 minutes, they have conceded 29 first-half strikes in 31 games but it felt for large parts that they were in control. They haven't looked like a side struggling in the Premier League but they find themselves level but will need to continue to move the ball with the speed currently shown and just add a clinical touch in the final third if they are to continue their fine form. Wolves have ridden their luck for parts of this game, but with Cunha on the bench they have the quality that could change the fixture in their favour.
We are back underway at Turf Moor, can anyone grab a winner in the second half?
Taylor was in two minds to launch a long throw-in into the box or play it short. He opts for the latter and Burnley set up just inside Wolves' half.
The Burnley fans are furious. Gomes goes down and Burnley want to carry on but it look as if the Wolves players just stop playing and the referee blows to see if Gomes is okay. Surprisingly... he is okay!
It is going to be difficult to call this game! In the 12 games Burnley have taken the lead this season, they have drawn four, lost four and won four. At least they are somewhat consistent.
A HUGE SAVE FROM MURIC! Ait-Nouri gets himself one-on-one and the Wolves goalscorer is met by Muric who has made himself big to deny him. He should have doubled his tally and put Wolves ahead.
Semedo takes his time with the restart and is quickly shown a yellow card.
Burnley decide to take a short corner and waste the chance to get the ball in the box. Wolves look to strike a counter-attack but Burnley do get back well to thwart the break.
BRUUN LARSEN IS DENIED! Burnley work the ball well and Vitinho cuts the ball back to Bruun Larsen who hits a good strike but Sa sticks out a leg to deny him.
SA SAVES AGAIN! Sa has been called into action twice in quick succession now, and Odobert almost catches him by surprise firing the ball towards the Portuguese who just instinctively swipes the ball away.
Bruun Larsen latches onto Muric's throughball and fires a shot that is stopped by Sa. The flag goes up but Burnley just switched the style of play up hitting a ball over the top.
Esteve makes a crucial interception to deny Chiwome. The youngster was waiting behind the defender to collect the cross but Esteve slid in to get the ball away.
Vitinho does well to rescue Foster's sloppy pass to win a corner, although the corner doesn't match Vitinho's effort and Wolves clear with ease.
Muric does well again. Wolves looked to have been through but before they know it Muric has sprinted off his line to clear the pass.
Bueno comes off for Bueno. Hugo B has made way for Santiago B with the sub slotting into a central defender position.
Burnley again have a heavy amount of possession on the cusp of Wolves' box but Bruun Larsen plays a cross straight into Sa which gives Wolves a chance to compose themselves.
Burnley's goalscorer has come off for Rodriguez. Bruun Larsen has been bright and had some chances but couldn't show a similar precision to his shooting that he did with the opener.
Odobert collects the ball just outside the box and hits a dipping shot towards goal but Sa manages to claim it well.
Chiwome has been bright but his game has ended with the introduction, and return, of Cunha. He has been out for a while, but can he make an instant impact.
Sarabia tries to shimmy and shake away from Berge and shot, he did the first part but the Norwiegan did well to block the shot.
Anywhere will do for Wolve right now, Sa whacks the ball away but it comes straight back to them almost instantly. Can Burnley make this pressure can and get a vital win?
It is bad news for Burnley! With Nottingham Forest beating Fulham 3-1 in the earlier kick-off they are currently six points adrift of Forest. A winning goal will be vital and send Burnley fans wild.
The attacking intent of Wolves has slightly been affected as Sarabia makes way for the more defensive Traore.
OFF THE POST! Wolves haven't ventured into Burnley's half too much in the last five minutes but Ait-Nouri sends a lofting ball to Lemina and in almost slow motion the ball just clips the post and goes out.
Foster has had a quiet evening and is replaced by Benson, who has had bright moments throughout his Burnley career. One more here would be much appreciated by all involved with Burnley.
Rodriguez has the ball in the back of the net after directing Odobert's shot onto the post then hitting the rebound in. The only problem is the Englishman is miles offside and he knew it.
Semedo bursts into space but when he looks up he is the only one attacking and he just stops for a second then plays it back to Kilman. Wolves won't really mind that, they have been up against it in the final moments of the game.
There is four more minutes to play here. Will be get the goal that will keep their survival hopes alive?
Gomes clatters into Benson and it is an easy decision. Yellow card, there was no intent to get the ball there really.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 1-1 WOLVES
Well that is a gutting result for Burnley, and that shows how far they have come in recent weeks. If not for Sa they could of had a couple of goals and could have picked up an important win that would have seen them keep chase with Nottingham Forest, who sit just outside the bottom three. Instead they are now six points behind 17th and with eight games remaining, as the margin for error gets smaller and smaller. The Clarets took a deserved lead when Bruun Larsen fired O'Shea's cross into the bottom corner, but Ait-Nouri cancelled the strike out in first-half stoppage time when he nodded Sarabia's free-kick past Muric. The Algerian could have punished Burnley again in the second period, but he was met by Muric, who thwarted the Algerian's shot and Burnley took control, although Bruun Larsen and Vitinho were met by an inspired Sa. Lemina hit the post on a rare flurry forward late in the game, but it finished 1-1 which matched the xG of 0.98 to 0.98. Burnley are unbeaten in four now, but will need to turn draws into wins if they are to stay in the Premier League. Thanks for joining us, goodbye!"	"Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s fortuitous goal proved enough for Everton to claim a much-needed 1-0 victory over 10-man Burnley at Goodison Park.
It had been 13 matches since Everton last won a Premier League match heading into Saturday’s match, with that victory coming back in December against Burnley at Turf Moor.
And Sean Dyche got one over on his former team again when Arijanet Muric’s clearance deflected in off Calvert-Lewin in the second minute of first-half stoppage time.
Dara O’Shea’s dismissal midway through the second half dented Burnley’s comeback hopes, as the Toffees move up to 15th, 10 points clear of the 19th-placed Clarets, though they remain only four clear of the relegation zone after Luton Town’s win over AFC Bournemouth.
How the match unfolded
Calvert-Lewin ended a 23-match scoreless streak when he netted against Newcastle United in midweek, and Everton’s No 9 might have been presented with an early tap-in if not for excellent near-post defending from Maxime Esteve.
Abdoulaye Doucoure drilled a cross-shot into Muric’s grasp, while Seamus Coleman got in the way of Charlie Taylor’s powerful effort at the other end.
Yet with Burnley having improved, Everton’s breakthrough arrived in remarkable fashion in the closing seconds of first-half stoppage time – Calvert-Lewin closing down Muric’s clearance and diverting the ball over Burnley’s goalkeeper and into the back of the net.
Muric somewhat atoned after the break, making a smart stop with his feet to deny Calvert-Lewin after the striker had capitalised on a sloppy mistake from Lorenz Assignon.
Burnley’s task was made all the harder when O’Shea received his marching orders for a desperate, high lunge on Dwight McNeil – referee Michael Oliver showing no hesitation in brandishing a straight red card.
Substitute Josh Brownhill nearly turned Burnley’s despair into jubilation, though, with a wicked effort that flashed just over.
Calvert-Lewin twice went close as Everton aimed to make their numerical advantage count, lashing wide after a great run before prodding at Muric from a tight angle.
His replacement Beto could have done better when charging through on goal late on, but Everton were not made to pay for their profligacy.
Only once in their history have Everton gone more than 13 league encounters without a win – back in 1937, when they went on a 14-match winless run.
Thankfully for Dyche, he will not go down as the Everton manager to match this unwanted record.
Dyche’s side are far from safe, but this victory – which comes on the two-year anniversary of his last win as Burnley boss, a 3-2 defeat of an Everton side then managed by Frank Lampard – was much-needed as the Toffees fight for safety.
In a relegation scrap of tight margins, Everton cannot afford to now not build on this as they aim to maintain their Premier League status.
Having replaced James Trafford between the sticks for Burnley as of late, Muric has been a key part of the Clarets’ upturn in form – Vincent Kompany’s team having come into this encounter on the back of a four-match unbeaten run."

It has left them with little to fight for as the season reaches its climax but, a win is a win and Gary O’Neil will be desperate for one just to boost his squad's confidence.
Team_6 (4-4-2): Arijanet Muric; Vitinho, Dara O’Shea, Maxime Esteve, Charlie Taylor; Jacob Bruun Larsen, Josh Cullen, Sander Berge, Wilson Odobert; David Datro Fofana, Lyle Foster.
SUBSTITUTES: Zeki Amdouni, Josh Brownhill, Jack Cork, Hannes Delcroix, Hjalmar Ekdal, Manuel Benson, Jay Rodriguez, Lawrence Vigouroux.
Team_20 (3-4-2-1) Jose Sa; Matt Doherty, Max Kilman, Toti; Nelson Semedo, Joao Gomes, Hugo Bueno, Rayan Ait-Nouri; Pablo Sarabia, Mario Lemina; Leon Chiwome.
SUBSTITUTES: Ty Barnett, Daniel Bentley, Santiago Bueno, Tawanda Chirewa, Matheus Cunha, Thomas Doyle, Nathan Fraser, Noha Lemina, Boubacar Traore.
Vincent Kompany has made two changes from that impressive draw away at Team_7 on the weekend. Fofana comes back up front after he was ineligible to play against his parent club, which is a huge boost as he is Team_6’s top goal scorer at Turf Moor. He only joined in January! Charlie Taylor replaces Lorenz Assignon who was sent off in the 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Muric continues in goal and looks to have become the number one, displacing James Trafford. The rest is the same as Kompany looks to build some consistency in his squad in the hope it can guide them closer to safety.
The big news for Team_20 is not in the starting line-up but on the bench as Cunha makes his return after missing seven games out. It is a big absence when he isn’t playing so O’Neil will be hoping to see an instant impact from their superstar. Up top for Team_20 is 18-year-old Chiwome who made his Premier League debut on the weekend against Team_2, and he must have impressed as he is rewarded with another start.
Team_20 have not enjoyed travelling to this part of Lancashire. They haven’t won at Turf Moor since 2010, and with Team_6 in their best run of form, can Team_20 overcome this difficult task? We will find out shortly as kick-off approaches.
KICK-OFF. Turf Moor lets out a roar as Team_6 gets us underway, can they continue to build on this unlikely push for Premier League safety?
Muric gets an early touch as he rushes out of his goal to collect Bueno's looping cross.
Fofana and Odobert link up beautifully and the winger finds himself galloping forward but his pass is just behind Bruun Larsen and it kills the attack. Good signs for Team_6 at the back and in attack so far.
Sa makes a fearless clearance there. He chucks himself at the ball as Team_6 shirts rush towards him but he manages to get there and heads it clear.
Sa is scurrying off his line again to deny Team_6 a corner after Odobert's deflected shot was slowly bobbling out of play before the Portuguese slapped it out for a throw-in.
Cullen has a great chance to get the ball into the box from a set piece, but it barely reaches the first man. It was a shocking free-kick.
Team_20 have had some big hitters injured this season with Hwang Hee-Chan and Pedro Neto also missing. It means that this starting team has only scored 13 of the 42 league goals they have netted this season. Four of those have come defenders. Yikes!
A bit of last-ditch defending from Team_20 here. Team_6 found themselves in the box a couple of times but are just unable to either pull the trigger or find a teammate. In comes Toti who smashes it clear.
Team_20 have their best spell of possession so far, and O'Shea gets a bit excited and drags Ait-Nouri back to relieve some pressure on the away side.
Confidence is a magical thing. You would believe that Team_20 are the team in the depths of a relegation scrap in the opening 17 minutes here. Team_6 are playing it around so quickly and with intent as well.
In terms of action on the pitch, there isn't too much to report on, but in the stands, a section of the crowd have had to be moved because of a leak in the roof. The fans who are moving aren't missing too much.
Ait-Nouri is let down by his touch, he just tries to push the ball into space but a heavy touch allows Vitinho to come in and clear the ball.
Doherty tries to go on his own and probably wishes he didn't. He cut in and attempted to whip it but on his weaker foot, it went wide.
Bueno has two attempts to cross the ball but on both occasions can only find claret and blue shirts. They weren't bad balls, Team_6 have just been really strong defensively so far in this half.
WOW! WHAT A CHANCE! Doherty sneaks round the back post to send Sarabia's corner back across goal to Gomes but the Brazilian flicks his header wide. He has his head in his hands and you can't blame him.
Muric has really had a huge impact on Team_6 recent form. The goalkeeper has been progressive with his passing, and at times a little bit risky but so far it is working out.
Sarabia nearly found Chiwome rushing through on-goal but the Spaniard takes a loose touch and then plays a poor pass which allows Esteve to intercept. If his touch was tighter Team_6 were in danger there.
Gomes has had to get some treatment. It allows Kompany and O'Neil to give some instructions to their teams. Both managers should be pretty happy with this opening 35 minutes so far.
SA SAVES! Vitinho shows some great footwork and drives into the box where the Team_20 players almost look a bit scared to touch him. He then shoots but Sa gobbles up the chance, which was a pretty easy stop for him.
Esteve is rescued by the referee's whistle. Team_20 looked to have pinched the ball of the defender and Esteve fell to the ground and luckily for him, the whistle blew as Team_20 looked to race away.
GOAAAL! Team_6 LEAD 1-0! It started with the goalkeeper and it ended with Bruun Larsen stoking a fantastic volley into the bottom corner. Sa could do nothing about that and Team_6 deserve it!
O'Shea receives the ball of Muric and he just roams into the space and lofts a ball to the back post where Bruun Larsen is waiting to strike a fierce volley to make it 1-0.
Chiwome has a chance to instantly respond. The youngster spins and shoots and it looks goal-bound but it clips his teammate Toti and goes out for a goal kick.
Team_6 are looking to get a second before the break. Foster walks into the box but can't find the space to shoot and it is cleared but Cullen is there to keep the pressure on. Team_20 stay strong and keep Sa's goal protected.
Chiwome has had a difficult evening so far, but for only his second-ever game in the Premier League he has continued to be busy throughout the opening half. He has just come up against Esteve who has is having a fine game so far.
Cullen finds himself free on the edge of the box and pulls the trigger although it doesn't test Sa at all.
GOAAAL! AIT-NOURI LEVELS IT! He has been so dangerous this half, and he just arrives in the box to cushion a header past Muric. It was such an easy header for the Algerian, and he now has three goals in four games. He has been so important for Team_20 recently and he continues to be so as he makes it 1-1.
Sarabia plays a delicate free-kick into a crowd of on-rushing Team_20 players and Ait-Nouri directs the cross past Muric to level. After a brief VAR check the goal stands.
Ait-Nouri has been the biggest threat for Team_20 so far and wins a free-kick for his side to have one last chance before the break.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 1-1 Team_20
Well it has been an exciting half, and a difficult one to call as well. Team_6 have been playing with a new-found confidence and took the lead with Bruun Larsen's volley. The Clarets had deserved it up until that point with Vitinho testing Sa moments before the opener, but Team_20 slowly built their way back into the game. Ait-Nouri has been the away sides brightest spark and stung Team_6 late on in the half. He won the free-kick and then met Sarabia's cross with a cushioned header to beat Muric and level the game.
It probably shouldn't have been a surprise that Team_6 were picking the ball out of the net in the opening 45 minutes, they have conceded 29 first-half strikes in 31 games but it felt for large parts that they were in control. They haven't looked like a side struggling in the Premier League but they find themselves level but will need to continue to move the ball with the speed currently shown and just add a clinical touch in the final third if they are to continue their fine form. Team_20 have ridden their luck for parts of this game, but with Cunha on the bench they have the quality that could change the fixture in their favour.
We are back underway at Turf Moor, can anyone grab a winner in the second half?
Taylor was in two minds to launch a long throw-in into the box or play it short. He opts for the latter and Team_6 set up just inside Team_20' half.
The Team_6 fans are furious. Gomes goes down and Team_6 want to carry on but it look as if the Team_20 players just stop playing and the referee blows to see if Gomes is okay. Surprisingly... he is okay!
It is going to be difficult to call this game! In the 12 games Team_6 have taken the lead this season, they have drawn four, lost four and won four. At least they are somewhat consistent.
A HUGE SAVE FROM MURIC! Ait-Nouri gets himself one-on-one and the Team_20 goalscorer is met by Muric who has made himself big to deny him. He should have doubled his tally and put Team_20 ahead.
Semedo takes his time with the restart and is quickly shown a yellow card.
Team_6 decide to take a short corner and waste the chance to get the ball in the box. Team_20 look to strike a counter-attack but Team_6 do get back well to thwart the break.
BRUUN LARSEN IS DENIED! Team_6 work the ball well and Vitinho cuts the ball back to Bruun Larsen who hits a good strike but Sa sticks out a leg to deny him.
SA SAVES AGAIN! Sa has been called into action twice in quick succession now, and Odobert almost catches him by surprise firing the ball towards the Portuguese who just instinctively swipes the ball away.
Bruun Larsen latches onto Muric's throughball and fires a shot that is stopped by Sa. The flag goes up but Team_6 just switched the style of play up hitting a ball over the top.
Esteve makes a crucial interception to deny Chiwome. The youngster was waiting behind the defender to collect the cross but Esteve slid in to get the ball away.
Vitinho does well to rescue Foster's sloppy pass to win a corner, although the corner doesn't match Vitinho's effort and Team_20 clear with ease.
Muric does well again. Team_20 looked to have been through but before they know it Muric has sprinted off his line to clear the pass.
Bueno comes off for Bueno. Hugo B has made way for Santiago B with the sub slotting into a central defender position.
Team_6 again have a heavy amount of possession on the cusp of Team_20' box but Bruun Larsen plays a cross straight into Sa which gives Team_20 a chance to compose themselves.
Team_6 goalscorer has come off for Rodriguez. Bruun Larsen has been bright and had some chances but couldn't show a similar precision to his shooting that he did with the opener.
Odobert collects the ball just outside the box and hits a dipping shot towards goal but Sa manages to claim it well.
Chiwome has been bright but his game has ended with the introduction, and return, of Cunha. He has been out for a while, but can he make an instant impact.
Sarabia tries to shimmy and shake away from Berge and shot, he did the first part but the Norwiegan did well to block the shot.
Anywhere will do for Wolve right now, Sa whacks the ball away but it comes straight back to them almost instantly. Can Team_6 make this pressure can and get a vital win?
It is bad news for Team_6! With Team_16 beating Team_10 3-1 in the earlier kick-off they are currently six points adrift of Forest. A winning goal will be vital and send Team_6 fans wild.
The attacking intent of Team_20 has slightly been affected as Sarabia makes way for the more defensive Traore.
OFF THE POST! Team_20 haven't ventured into Team_6 half too much in the last five minutes but Ait-Nouri sends a lofting ball to Lemina and in almost slow motion the ball just clips the post and goes out.
Foster has had a quiet evening and is replaced by Benson, who has had bright moments throughout his Team_6 career. One more here would be much appreciated by all involved with Team_6.
Rodriguez has the ball in the back of the net after directing Odobert's shot onto the post then hitting the rebound in. The only problem is the Englishman is miles offside and he knew it.
Semedo bursts into space but when he looks up he is the only one attacking and he just stops for a second then plays it back to Kilman. Team_20 won't really mind that, they have been up against it in the final moments of the game.
There is four more minutes to play here. Will be get the goal that will keep their survival hopes alive?
Gomes clatters into Benson and it is an easy decision. Yellow card, there was no intent to get the ball there really.
FULL-TIME: Team_6 1-1 Team_20
Well that is a gutting result for Team_6, and that shows how far they have come in recent weeks. If not for Sa they could of had a couple of goals and could have picked up an important win that would have seen them keep chase with Team_16, who sit just outside the bottom three. Instead they are now six points behind 17th and with eight games remaining, as the margin for error gets smaller and smaller. The Clarets took a deserved lead when Bruun Larsen fired O'Shea's cross into the bottom corner, but Ait-Nouri cancelled the strike out in first-half stoppage time when he nodded Sarabia's free-kick past Muric. The Algerian could have punished Team_6 again in the second period, but he was met by Muric, who thwarted the Algerian's shot and Team_6 took control, although Bruun Larsen and Vitinho were met by an inspired Sa. Lemina hit the post on a rare flurry forward late in the game, but it finished 1-1 which matched the xG of 0.98 to 0.98. Team_6 are unbeaten in four now, but will need to turn draws into wins if they are to stay in the Premier League. Thanks for joining us, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93350	Sheffield Utd	Man City	2023-08-27	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	31336.0	Jarred Gillett	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Brentford and Tottenham at Brentford Community Stadium!
While Brentford have won just two of their opening league games over the past 11 seasons, they have not lost either of their two Premier League openers to date. Since promotion in 2021, the Bees have beaten Arsenal and held Leicester City to a 2-2 draw. Thomas Frank's side finished just one point and one place behind their opponents here in last term's final standings, having posted five wins from their final six games. Though unbeaten throughout their last nine capital-city fixtures in the Premier League - winning each of the last four in a row - Brentford have a miserable record against Tottenham: they have won only two of the teams' 10 league meetings.
Since they last met Brentford in May, when the Bees stung their hosts with a 3-1 win, much has changed at Tottenham. The post-Harry Kane era begins here, as Spurs also play their first competitive fixture under Ange Postecoglou. The departure of their talisman and leading goalscorer comes after an eighth-placed finish last term and defeat in their final friendly of pre-season, which saw them beaten by Barcelona on Tuesday. Nonetheless, the Lilywhites have lost their first league game just once in the last seven years, winning on five occasions.
BRENTFORD (3-5-2): Mark Flekken; Nathan Collins, Kristoffer Ajer, Ethan Pinnock; Aaron Hickey, Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt, Rico Henry; Yoane Wissa, Bryan Mbeumo.
SUBS: Thomas Strakosha, Mathias Jorgensen, Mikkel Damsgaard, Josh Dasilva, Mads Roerslev, Kevin Schade, Keane Lewis-Potter, Shandon Baptiste, Yehor Yarmoliuk.
TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Emerson Royal, Micky van de Ven, Cristian Romero, Destiny Udogie; Oliver Skipp, Yves Bissouma; Dejan Kulusevski, James Maddison, Son Heung-Min; Richarlison.
SUBS: Brandon Austin, Ben Davies, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Davinson Sanchez, Giovani Lo Celso, Manor Solomon, Pedro Porro, Ivan Perisic, Pape Sarr.
While recent signings Flekken and Collins start for Brentford, star striker Ivan Toney remains unavailable due to a suspension that runs until the start of 2024. With first-choice goalkeeper David Raya reportedly soon to depart, Flekken features between the posts, behind a line-up captained by Norgaard, who has overcome an injury to take his place in midfield. In Toney's absence, Mbeumo and Wissa are paired up front.
Spurs name a quartet of debutants for their Premier League opener, as Van de Ven, Udogie, Maddison and Vicario all start. The latter replaces club captain Hugo Lloris in goal, while Richarlison steps into the void left by Kane; new captain Son supports the Brazil striker up front. Rodrigo Bentancur joins Fraser Forster, Ryan Sessegnon and Bryan Gil on the sidelines due to injury.
The players come out onto the pitch at Brentford Community Stadium, with kick-off just moments away. However, just as the game is set to start, kick-off has been delayed due to a problem with sanitation inside Brentford Community Stadium. The anticipation builds still further!
Following a brief delay, Brentford kick off, and we are under way in London!
A clash of heads between Romero and Mbeumo on the edge of Spurs' box sees the action halted, and both medical teams race onto the pitch in order to assess them.
Following treatment, both players are ultimately able to recover from their collision, and after the action resumes they both rejoin the fray.
Tottenham have taken the intiative since the game got back under way, as Brentford sit back and seek to soak up pressure before countering at speed.
Under new management, Spurs' starting XI has an average age of 25 years and 65 days - their youngest in a Premier League match since March 2020 v Wolves, when Jose Mourinho was in charge.
After Collins concedes a corner, Brentford are put under significant pressure inside their own area, as the visitors zip the ball around purposefully in the final third.
SPURS LEAD! Having recovered from his earlier head injury, Romero sprints in to the six-yard box and steers home a header, which leaves Flekken well beaten! Maddison's whipped free-kick from the left set him up, and Tottenham lead 1-0!
Kicking off his assist account for the new season, Maddison crosses from a free-kick on the left and finds the head of Romero.
OFFSIDE? Spurs' joy is quelled, as the VAR is now inspecting Romero's goal - it seems there's a suspicion of offside when he heads the ball in from close range. It's too close to call!
GOAL GIVEN! After much scrutiny, Romero's goal stands! He was onside by a matter of millimetres! 1-0 to Spurs!
Ending an eventful start to his season, Romero is now withdrawn due to concussion, following his head injury earlier. Sanchez replaces him at centre-back, but the Argentina international is clearly not happy!
SAVE! First, Vicario manages to punch clear under heavy pressure inside his box, then Brentford recycle the ball and Wissa picks out Mbeumo with a throughball down the left side of the area, before the latter unleashes a powerful shot towards the bottom corner: Vicario is equal to it! That's a corner for the hosts.
Vicario is called upon again, as Wissa pulls off an acrobatic overhead kick from near the penalty spot, which loops up and into the goalkeeper's gloves on the centre of his goal-line.
After Henry fires a dangerous low ball across the box from the left, an alert Udogie covers from full-back and steals it away from a Brentford boot when immediate danger was looming.
Norgaard can't quite bring a cross into the six-yard box under control, and the ball loops up off his boot, which allows Vicario to leap high and claim it.
PENALTY FOR BRENTFORD? After a long passage of play is ended by Jensen hammering the ball into touch, a VAR review will commence! Earlier on, Son tracked back and tries to nick the ball from Jensen in the area, but just clipped his opponent instead.
BRENTFORD HAVE A SPOT-KICK! After looking at the penalty incident on the pitchside monitor, the referee points to the spot! The Bees can strike back now, with a great chance to equalise from 12 yards!
For dissent towards the referee, following the decision to award Brentford a penalty, Vicario is booked on his Premier League debut.
BRENTFORD PULL LEVEL! Mirroring his team-mate Toney's penalty technique, Mbeumo steps up and skips into his spot-kick, placing it coolly into the bottom corner! Vicario went the wrong way, and it's now 1-1 at Brentford Community Stadium!
Continuing the new disciplinary regime of the Premier League, Spurs coach Ryan Mason is now sent from the touchline, as the fall-out from Brentford's penalty-kick continues.
An overhit pass by Maddison drifts out of play on the right byline, but the Spurs debutant has been one of few players to have made a mark on this game for the visitors. In addition to his assist for Tottenham's goal, he has looked to link the play in familiar style.
Deep in Brentford territory, Sanchez bundles over Janelt and then Henry, but only his challenge on the latter is deemed worthy of a free-kick for Brentford.
Mostly thanks to Toney's proficiency from the spot - and partly to Mbeumo's strike here - since their promotion to the Premier League in 2021, only Manchester City (16) have scored more penalties than Brentford (14) in England's top flight.
Richarlison and Emerson combine well on the edge of the box, but when Son receives the ball he can't bring it under his spell and Spurs' attack breaks down.
THE BEES LEAD! The hosts have turned it around! Henry surges to the left byline and then cuts a low ball back for Wissa in the box, and via a desperate deflection from Van de Ven the ball beats Vicario and nestles in the net! It's now 2-1 to Brentford!
A typically decisive sprint into space on the left flank opens up space for Henry, who delivers a precise pass for Wissa to fire home.
Maddison also receives a booking for dissent.
After another clumsy tackle, this time on Wissa, substitute Sanchez is shown a yellow card.
Following his strike here, Wissa has now been involved in four goals across his last four starts in the Premier League (three of his own and one assist). That's as many as in his previous 13.
Tottenham are trying to apply some sustained pressure on the Brentford box, but their hosts are standing strong. Aside from conceding the opening goal via a set-piece, the Bees are proving difficult to break down.
Having received the ball from Maddison, Bissouma tries his luck with a shot from outside the box, which is blocked.
As Bissouma seeks to regain possession after his error gives the ball away, he hauls back Wissa and Brentford will have a free-kick deep inside their own half.
Following three team-mates into the referee's notebook, Skipp pulls back Jensen by the sleeve and is rightly penalised.
Due to the stoppages for VAR checks and Romero's injury earlier on, we are now into 11 minutes of additional time at the end of the first half.
After a cross is swept over from the right by Maddison, a tightly-marked Richarlison manages to flick the ball on with his head. However, Son slices the ball straight into the side-netting near the back post.
SPURS EQUALISE! A spin from Maddison opens up space on the edge of the area and sends the ball into the path of an on-rushing Emerson. The full-back then lines up a low strike and thumps the ball into the bottom-left corner from 20 yards out! That pulls the away side level just before the break!
Already making an impact at his new club, Spurs playmaker Maddison sets up another goal - this time turning and playing in Emerson on the edge of Brentford's box.
New Tottenham vice-captain Maddison has now set up four goals in five Premier League appearances against Brentford.
MISS! Yet another lung-bursting run down the left by Henry opens up Tottenham's defence, and his precise delivery towards the back post picks out Mbeumo. However, the Cameroon international fails to control his volleyed effort and effectively misses an open goal - a great chance spurned!
HALF-TIME: BRENTFORD 2-2 TOTTENHAM
An eventful opening period - which only started after a delay - sees the teams all-square at the break, with Tottenham scoring either side of Brentford's two-goal salvo midway through the half. Romero scored the opener and was then withdrawn due to concussion, before a penalty and a counter-strike put the Bees in front. Then, deep into a huge serving of stoppage time, Spurs found their spectacular leveller. That leaves things perfectly poised for the second half.
Such has been their resilience, Brentford are unbeaten across their last 13 Premier League matches when drawing at half-time in the Premier League, since losing to Leeds on the final day of the 2021-22 campaign. While the Bees have not won four consecutive top-flight matches since 1939, with a second-half winner they would do so here.
Tottenham kick off, and we are back under way at Brentford Community Stadium!
Maddison exchanges passes with Skipp outside the area, then sends in a tame low shot; Flekken makes a routine stop in the centre of his goal.
Having sustained an apparent muscular injury, Jensen has to come off early in the second half. His compatriot Damsgaard will replace the Danish midfielder.
Richarlison surges to the left byline, earning his team a corner by rebounding the ball off a Brentford defender. Form the set-piece, Ajer is forced to concede another corner-kick.
Despite failing to set up for a clean strike from the right side of the area, Kulusevski tries his luck at goal. As a result, the winger's mishit shot trundles wide of the target.
Richarlison applies more pressure to the Brentford back line, this time shutting down Collins inside the six-yard box and forcing the Irish defender to concede a corner. Spurs are on top at the start of this half.
DOUBLE SAVE! With their first attacking move of the second half, Brentford test Vicario twice! First, the goalkeeper pushes away a dangerous ball across the box; then, Damsgaard fails to connect fully with a shot from 15 yards and sees it stopped.
SHARP STOP! Flekken denies Son! Another Spurs corner is delivered by Maddison, and after Kulusevski then picks up the loose ball, the winger's deflected cross falls into the Tottenham's captain's path. However, his powerful strike at the bottom-left corner is saved!
For aggressively bundling over Son midway through Brentford's half, Hickey is booked by the referee.
SAVE! Spurs' dominance continues, as Richarlison tests Flekken with a stinging shot! The Brazilian striker runs through down the right side of the area to collect Maddison's throughball, but can only thump his attempt straight at the Dutch stopper.
After Henry toys with Emerson out on the left flank, he rolls the ball back inside for Norgaard, who overhits his cross into the box; allowing Vicario to grab the ball without too much trouble.
It's relentless pressure from the away team now, as full-back Udogie arrives near the byline and cuts a ball into the danger zone, forcing Pinnock to make a hurried hack clear.
Son and Udogie combine well on the left flank, but the Spurs skipper then finds himself dispossessed by the byline and another attack breaks down.
Frank senses that his side are flagging now, with Spurs in the ascendancy. First, he introduces Roerslev in place of Hickey.
Baptiste comes on for Brentford captain Norgaard.
Finally, Schade replaces Wissa up front for the Bees.
Spurs respond with their own series of substitutions. First, Skipp makes way for fellow midfielder Sarr.
After a disappointing shift, Son is also withdrawn; Perisic replaces him on the left wing.
Since the substitutions for both sides, Spurs have lost a little momentum. They seemed sure to find a breakthrough at some stage, but Brentford are now edging their way back into this contest.
PENALTY FOR BRENTFORD? Though Schade drops down to the turf under a challenge from Van de Ven inside Tottenham's area, it appears that the Dutch defender cleanly won the ball. Nonetheless, the VAR is conducting a review!
NO PENALTY! It doesn't take long for the VAR to decide that no action is required: Van de Ven did not foul Schade in the box!
A rather hopeful prodded cross from the right by Roerslev only finds Vicario in the Spurs area, as the goalkeeper comes off his line and coolly claims the ball.
Under close attention from a defender, Sarr loops a tame 10-yard header straight at Flekken in the Brentford goal.
Brentford make a change at the back, as Ajer departs and Jorgensen is introduced.
Brentford waste a set-piece opportunity from the right flank, but they quickly regain possession. Then, Jorgensen flashes a lobbed cross from outside the box just past the far post, almost embarrasing Vicario, who can't quite get his fingertips to it.
Another chance is spurned by Richarlison, as the Spurs striker pokes a laboured shot straight at Jorgensen from the brink of the box. He failed to open up his body enough to strike it cleanly - would Kane have found the bottom corner there?
At the end of this half there will be a more moderate four minutes added on for stoppages, but can either side now find a late winner?
Brentford continue to defend their box expertly, and Spurs remain frustrated. The clock ticks down towards the final whistle.
FULL-TIME: BRENTFORD 2-2 TOTTENHAM
Following a frantic first half packed with goals and incident, Brentford and Tottenham play out a tense 2-2 draw in their first fixture of the new Premier League campaign. Spurs' new style, post-Kane and with Postecoglou at the helm, saw the visitors make more successful passes in a single league game than in any match since January 2022, yet they could not find a winner against an obdurate home side. The spoils are shared, with the Bees perhaps more content with their point.
Both teams now have nearly a week to prepare for their next Premier League contest, as Spurs host Manchester United next Saturday while Brentford meet rivals Fulham at Craven Cottage.
That's all from Brentford Community Stadium, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	Referee: Jarred Gillett. Assistants: Simon Bennett, Darren Cann. Fourth official: David Coote.

While Team_4 have won just two of their opening league games over the past 11 seasons, they have not lost either of their two Premier League openers to date.

Spurs name a quartet of debutants for their Premier League opener, as Van de Ven, Udogie, Maddison and Vicario all start. The latter replaces club captain Hugo Lloris in goal, while Richarlison steps into the void left by Kane; new captain Son supports the Brazil striker up front. Rodrigo Bentancur joins Fraser Forster, Ryan Sessegnon and Bryan Gil on the sidelines due to injury.
The players come out onto the pitch at Team_4 Community Stadium, with kick-off just moments away. However, just as the game is set to start, kick-off has been delayed due to a problem with sanitation inside Team_4 Community Stadium. The anticipation builds still further!
Following a brief delay, Team_4 kick off, and we are under way in London!
A clash of heads between Romero and Mbeumo on the edge of Spurs' box sees the action halted, and both medical teams race onto the pitch in order to assess them.
Following treatment, both players are ultimately able to recover from their collision, and after the action resumes they both rejoin the fray.
Team_18 have taken the intiative since the game got back under way, as Team_4 sit back and seek to soak up pressure before countering at speed.
Under new management, Spurs' starting XI has an average age of 25 years and 65 days - their youngest in a Premier League match since March 2020 v Team_20, when Jose Mourinho was in charge.
After Collins concedes a corner, Team_4 are put under significant pressure inside their own area, as the visitors zip the ball around purposefully in the final third.
SPURS LEAD! Having recovered from his earlier head injury, Romero sprints in to the six-yard box and steers home a header, which leaves Flekken well beaten! Maddison's whipped free-kick from the left set him up, and Team_18 lead 1-0!
Kicking off his assist account for the new season, Maddison crosses from a free-kick on the left and finds the head of Romero.
OFFSIDE? Spurs' joy is quelled, as the VAR is now inspecting Romero's goal - it seems there's a suspicion of offside when he heads the ball in from close range. It's too close to call!
GOAL GIVEN! After much scrutiny, Romero's goal stands! He was onside by a matter of millimetres! 1-0 to Spurs!
Ending an eventful start to his season, Romero is now withdrawn due to concussion, following his head injury earlier. Sanchez replaces him at centre-back, but the Argentina international is clearly not happy!
SAVE! First, Vicario manages to punch clear under heavy pressure inside his box, then Team_4 recycle the ball and Wissa picks out Mbeumo with a throughball down the left side of the area, before the latter unleashes a powerful shot towards the bottom corner: Vicario is equal to it! That's a corner for the hosts.
Vicario is called upon again, as Wissa pulls off an acrobatic overhead kick from near the penalty spot, which loops up and into the goalkeeper's gloves on the centre of his goal-line.
After Henry fires a dangerous low ball across the box from the left, an alert Udogie covers from full-back and steals it away from a Team_4 boot when immediate danger was looming.
Norgaard can't quite bring a cross into the six-yard box under control, and the ball loops up off his boot, which allows Vicario to leap high and claim it.
PENALTY FOR Team_4? After a long passage of play is ended by Jensen hammering the ball into touch, a VAR review will commence! Earlier on, Son tracked back and tries to nick the ball from Jensen in the area, but just clipped his opponent instead.
Team_4 HAVE A SPOT-KICK! After looking at the penalty incident on the pitchside monitor, the referee points to the spot! The Bees can strike back now, with a great chance to equalise from 12 yards!
For dissent towards the referee, following the decision to award Team_4 a penalty, Vicario is booked on his Premier League debut.
Team_4 PULL LEVEL! Mirroring his team-mate Toney's penalty technique, Mbeumo steps up and skips into his spot-kick, placing it coolly into the bottom corner! Vicario went the wrong way, and it's now 1-1 at Team_4 Community Stadium!
Continuing the new disciplinary regime of the Premier League, Spurs coach Ryan Mason is now sent from the touchline, as the fall-out from Team_4 penalty-kick continues.
An overhit pass by Maddison drifts out of play on the right byline, but the Spurs debutant has been one of few players to have made a mark on this game for the visitors. In addition to his assist for Team_18 goal, he has looked to link the play in familiar style.
Deep in Team_4 territory, Sanchez bundles over Janelt and then Henry, but only his challenge on the latter is deemed worthy of a free-kick for Team_4.
Mostly thanks to Toney's proficiency from the spot - and partly to Mbeumo's strike here - since their promotion to the Premier League in 2021, only Team_13 (16) have scored more penalties than Team_4 (14) in England's top flight.
Richarlison and Emerson combine well on the edge of the box, but when Son receives the ball he can't bring it under his spell and Spurs' attack breaks down.
THE BEES LEAD! The hosts have turned it around! Henry surges to the left byline and then cuts a low ball back for Wissa in the box, and via a desperate deflection from Van de Ven the ball beats Vicario and nestles in the net! It's now 2-1 to Team_4!
A typically decisive sprint into space on the left flank opens up space for Henry, who delivers a precise pass for Wissa to fire home.
Maddison also receives a booking for dissent.
After another clumsy tackle, this time on Wissa, substitute Sanchez is shown a yellow card.
Following his strike here, Wissa has now been involved in four goals across his last four starts in the Premier League (three of his own and one assist). That's as many as in his previous 13.
Team_18 are trying to apply some sustained pressure on the Team_4 box, but their hosts are standing strong. Aside from conceding the opening goal via a set-piece, the Bees are proving difficult to break down.
Having received the ball from Maddison, Bissouma tries his luck with a shot from outside the box, which is blocked.
As Bissouma seeks to regain possession after his error gives the ball away, he hauls back Wissa and Team_4 will have a free-kick deep inside their own half.
Following three team-mates into the referee's notebook, Skipp pulls back Jensen by the sleeve and is rightly penalised.
Due to the stoppages for VAR checks and Romero's injury earlier on, we are now into 11 minutes of additional time at the end of the first half.
After a cross is swept over from the right by Maddison, a tightly-marked Richarlison manages to flick the ball on with his head. However, Son slices the ball straight into the side-netting near the back post.
SPURS EQUALISE! A spin from Maddison opens up space on the edge of the area and sends the ball into the path of an on-rushing Emerson. The full-back then lines up a low strike and thumps the ball into the bottom-left corner from 20 yards out! That pulls the away side level just before the break!
Already making an impact at his new club, Spurs playmaker Maddison sets up another goal - this time turning and playing in Emerson on the edge of Team_4 box.
New Team_18 vice-captain Maddison has now set up four goals in five Premier League appearances against Team_4.
MISS! Yet another lung-bursting run down the left by Henry opens up Team_18 defence, and his precise delivery towards the back post picks out Mbeumo. However, the Cameroon international fails to control his volleyed effort and effectively misses an open goal - a great chance spurned!
HALF-TIME: Team_4 2-2 Team_18
An eventful opening period - which only started after a delay - sees the teams all-square at the break, with Team_18 scoring either side of Team_4 two-goal salvo midway through the half. Romero scored the opener and was then withdrawn due to concussion, before a penalty and a counter-strike put the Bees in front. Then, deep into a huge serving of stoppage time, Spurs found their spectacular leveller. That leaves things perfectly poised for the second half.
Such has been their resilience, Team_4 are unbeaten across their last 13 Premier League matches when drawing at half-time in the Premier League, since losing to Leeds on the final day of the 2021-22 campaign. While the Bees have not won four consecutive top-flight matches since 1939, with a second-half winner they would do so here.
Team_18 kick off, and we are back under way at Team_4 Community Stadium!
Maddison exchanges passes with Skipp outside the area, then sends in a tame low shot; Flekken makes a routine stop in the centre of his goal.
Having sustained an apparent muscular injury, Jensen has to come off early in the second half. His compatriot Damsgaard will replace the Danish midfielder.
Richarlison surges to the left byline, earning his team a corner by rebounding the ball off a Team_4 defender. Form the set-piece, Ajer is forced to concede another corner-kick.
Despite failing to set up for a clean strike from the right side of the area, Kulusevski tries his luck at goal. As a result, the winger's mishit shot trundles wide of the target.
Richarlison applies more pressure to the Team_4 back line, this time shutting down Collins inside the six-yard box and forcing the Irish defender to concede a corner. Spurs are on top at the start of this half.
DOUBLE SAVE! With their first attacking move of the second half, Team_4 test Vicario twice! First, the goalkeeper pushes away a dangerous ball across the box; then, Damsgaard fails to connect fully with a shot from 15 yards and sees it stopped.
SHARP STOP! Flekken denies Son! Another Spurs corner is delivered by Maddison, and after Kulusevski then picks up the loose ball, the winger's deflected cross falls into the Team_18 captain's path. However, his powerful strike at the bottom-left corner is saved!
For aggressively bundling over Son midway through Team_4 half, Hickey is booked by the referee.
SAVE! Spurs' dominance continues, as Richarlison tests Flekken with a stinging shot! The Brazilian striker runs through down the right side of the area to collect Maddison's throughball, but can only thump his attempt straight at the Dutch stopper.
After Henry toys with Emerson out on the left flank, he rolls the ball back inside for Norgaard, who overhits his cross into the box; allowing Vicario to grab the ball without too much trouble.
It's relentless pressure from the away team now, as full-back Udogie arrives near the byline and cuts a ball into the danger zone, forcing Pinnock to make a hurried hack clear.
Son and Udogie combine well on the left flank, but the Spurs skipper then finds himself dispossessed by the byline and another attack breaks down.
Frank senses that his side are flagging now, with Spurs in the ascendancy. First, he introduces Roerslev in place of Hickey.
Baptiste comes on for Team_4 captain Norgaard.
Finally, Schade replaces Wissa up front for the Bees.
Spurs respond with their own series of substitutions. First, Skipp makes way for fellow midfielder Sarr.
After a disappointing shift, Son is also withdrawn; Perisic replaces him on the left wing.
Since the substitutions for both sides, Spurs have lost a little momentum. They seemed sure to find a breakthrough at some stage, but Team_4 are now edging their way back into this contest.
PENALTY FOR Team_4? Though Schade drops down to the turf under a challenge from Van de Ven inside Team_18 area, it appears that the Dutch defender cleanly won the ball. Nonetheless, the VAR is conducting a review!
NO PENALTY! It doesn't take long for the VAR to decide that no action is required: Van de Ven did not foul Schade in the box!
A rather hopeful prodded cross from the right by Roerslev only finds Vicario in the Spurs area, as the goalkeeper comes off his line and coolly claims the ball.
Under close attention from a defender, Sarr loops a tame 10-yard header straight at Flekken in the Team_4 goal.
Team_4 make a change at the back, as Ajer departs and Jorgensen is introduced.
Team_4 waste a set-piece opportunity from the right flank, but they quickly regain possession. Then, Jorgensen flashes a lobbed cross from outside the box just past the far post, almost embarrasing Vicario, who can't quite get his fingertips to it.
Another chance is spurned by Richarlison, as the Spurs striker pokes a laboured shot straight at Jorgensen from the brink of the box. He failed to open up his body enough to strike it cleanly - would Kane have found the bottom corner there?
At the end of this half there will be a more moderate four minutes added on for stoppages, but can either side now find a late winner?
Team_4 continue to defend their box expertly, and Spurs remain frustrated. The clock ticks down towards the final whistle.
FULL-TIME: Team_4 2-2 Team_18
Following a frantic first half packed with goals and incident, Team_4 and Team_18 play out a tense 2-2 draw in their first fixture of the new Premier League campaign. Spurs' new style, post-Kane and with Postecoglou at the helm, saw the visitors make more successful passes in a single league game than in any match since January 2022, yet they could not find a winner against an obdurate home side. The spoils are shared, with the Bees perhaps more content with their point.
Both teams now have nearly a week to prepare for their next Premier League contest, as Spurs host Team_14 next Saturday while Team_4 meet rivals Team_10 at Craven Cottage.
That's all from Team_4 Community Stadium, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93436	Crystal Palace	Everton	2023-11-11	Selhurst Park, London	25103.0	Samuel Barrott	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this fixture in the Premier League, as Chelsea host Brentford in a west London derby at Stamford Bridge.
Mauricio Pochettino’s Chelsea have recovered from a poor start to the season and are unbeaten in their last three games, convincingly beating Fulham and Burnley away from home before a 2-2 draw with London rivals Arsenal last time out.
The Bees had been going through a rough patch of their own, not winning in six since beating Fulham 3-0 in the second game of the season. Three draws and losses apiece followed, but Thomas Frank’s side returned to form in their most recent home game, defeating Burnley 3-0.
CHELSEA (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez; Marc Cucurella, Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo; Noni Madueke, Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling; Nicolas Jackson.
CHELSEA SUBS: Djordje Petrovic, Eddie Beach, Benoit Badiashile, Lesley Ugochukwu, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington, Alex Matos.
BRENTFORD (3-5-2): Mark Flekken; Kristoffer Ajer, Ethan Pinnock, Nathan Collins; Mads Roerslev, Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt, Aaron Hickey; Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa.
BRENTFORD SUBS: Thomas Strakosha, Neal Maupay, Zanka Jorgensen, Saman Ghoddos, Frank Onyeka, Ben Mee, Yehor Yarmolyuk, Michael Olakigbe, Ethan Brierley.
Chelsea make three changes from the side held to a draw by Arsenal, with Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson back leading the line following a wrist injury. Axel Disasi and Noni Madueke join the defence and attacking midfield lines respectively, with Malo Gusto on the bench and Enzo Fernandez and Mykhailo Mudryk surprisingly absent from the squad.
Aaron Hickey is back in the Brentford XI following a one-match ban, and slots in at left wing-back in one of two changes. Mads Roerslev occupies the opposite flank for the Bees, with Neal Maupay and Frank Onyeka shifting to the bench.
Gallagher and Norgaard lead their respective teams out of the tunnel, and we're almost ready to go at Stamford Bridge!
Following a minute's applause to honour the life of England's World Cup-winning hero Bobby Charlton, Brentford get the game underway as Jensen kicks off!
Brentford have won both of their Premier League away games against Chelsea – no team has ever won their first three games at Stamford Bridge in the history of the competition.
CHANCE!!! Chelsea break at speed after a long throw from Roerslev comes to nothing. Sterling canters over halfway and finds Palmer to his right, but the youngster's return ball into the box is just a fraction behind the England winger and Brentford survive!
Chelsea have won just two of their last 12 London derbies in the Premier League, beating Crystal Palace 1-0 in January and Fulham 2-0 earlier this month. The Blues threw away a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with Arsenal in their most recent match.
WIDE!!! Cucurella and Jackson combine down the left and the Chelsea striker cuts inside looking for shooting space. He fires an effort goalwards from the edge of the box, but it's safe enough for Flekken to leave as the ball curls around the far post!
CHANCE!! Mbeumo is put in behind the defence by Janelt's pass, but the Brentford forward is forced to shoot from a tight angle and smashes the ball into the side netting! Mbeumo wants a corner but it doesn't come, as Sanchez picks the ball up quickly looking to spark a counter-attack!
OFF THE WOODWORK!!! The Chelsea counter-attack almost works a treat, as Sanchez's out-ball is played forward by Gallagher to Madueke. He steps onto his left foot and curls a shot towards goal, which has Flekken beaten all ends up before bouncing back off the crossbar!
Roerslev's low cross off a wide pass from Wissa is cut out, and Chelsea set off on the break once more. It's played across to Sterling, who tees up Madueke, but his latest effort is well blocked by Collins!
SAVED!!! Collins gets in the way of another effort, this time from Jackson, but Chelsea just keep on coming at the Bees. Gallagher finds shooting space and lets fly from 25 yards, but Flekken gets down well to parry his low drive away from danger!
Chelsea have won more points (seven) and scored more goals (eight) in their last three Premier League games than they did in their previous nine beforehand (six points, seven goals). Building.
Hickey slides in to dispossess Madueke with a crunching tackle that sparks a fast break down the left for Brentford, but play is soon brought back with the Chelsea winger down injured.
Chelsea pile numbers into the final third, looking to open Brentford up, but neither Sterling nor Jackson can pick out that defence-splitting pass with the Bees able to withstand the pressure.
SAVED!!! Chelsea spurn their best chance yet to go ahead!! Palmer's scooped ball into the six-yard box is met by the arriving Cucurella on the fly, but he can only volley straight into the midriff of Flekken!
OVER!!! Madueke and Palmer combine on the edge of the box for the latter to put Sterling through on goal, but it's blazed over the top from close range by the winger in a chance that looked easier to score than miss!
Sterling picks out Palmer with a lofted pass into the box, but Pinnock and Roerslev combine to win the ball back and clear for Brentford.
Disasi's throughball into the box opens Brentford up and gives Sterling space to cross, but neither Palmer nor Gallagher can connect and another chance goes begging!
Sterling goes down under pressure from Roerslev as the pair contest another reverse ball into the box from Palmer, but both the on-field referee and VAR are in agreement that the contact wasn't worthy of a penalty.
Flekken launches a long Brentford free-kick into the box, but Wissa's attempt at a shot is cleared and forward come Chelsea. Jackson leads the charge, but Roerslev and Mbeumo get back at speed to win the ball for the Bees.
Brentford are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League London derbies, winning six, which is their longest run without defeat against London sides in history. Away from home they’ve won their last three such games, never winning four in a row on the road before.
Sterling darts around the outside of Roerslev and drills a low cross into the box, but Pinnock steps in to put the ball behind for the game's very first corner!
Chelsea win a second successive corner on the opposite side, but Gallagher's attempt to play the ball short to Palmer is easily read and dealt with by Mbeumo.
Sterling spots the run of Caicedo and dinks the ball towards the back post, but it's far too close to Flekken and the Brentford goalkeeper collects.
CHANCE!!! Disasi fires a low ball at pace to the feet of Jackson, but the striker can't quite connect before the pass is dived upon by Flekken for the Bees!
After Madueke's surging run into the box is thwarted by Hickey, Chelsea look to the left side, but Gallagher's cross-field ball to Sterling can't be kept in the field of play by the England winger!
WIDE!!! Another golden chance for the Blues! Cucurella's floated cross into the box is met by Ajer, but his flicked header only falls to Madueke. Unmarked at the far post, the winger fires goalwards, but blasts the ball past the wrong side of the right-hand post!
CHANCE!!! Madueke's cut-back from the byline is met late by Cucurella arriving in the centre, but he can't strike the ball cleanly and it loops straight into Flekken's gloves!
Janelt's pass forward is deflected into the path of Mbeumo, who crosses towards the far post. Hickey's following in and has space to shoot, but his attempt to chest the ball down sends it over the line and behind!
Colwill's block from an Mbeumo cross gives Brentford their first corner of the game, but the delivery is easily nodded down and dealt with by the hosts.
OVER!!! Wissa drags Caicedo down on the edge of Brentford's box, gifting Chelsea a free-kick from 20 yards. Palmer steps up on set-piece duty, but can only send a curling finish over the top of Flekken's goal!
We'll play two additional minutes to close out this (somehow) goalless first half at Stamford Bridge.
A foot injury to Jensen takes a minute or so for the Brentford medical team to deal with, meaning we'll likely run beyond the allocated minutes at the end of this half.
HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 0-0 BRENTFORD.
We're all square at the break, with hosts Chelsea having done everything but score in the first 45 minutes! It's been one-way traffic for much of the half, but despite Chelsea piling numbers forward at every available opportunity, they've been unable to beat Flekken or force him into any difficult saves of note. The Bees keeper has been called into action by Gallagher and Cucurella's shots on goal, and Madueke has struck the crossbar, but Jackson, Sterling and Madueke again have all put glorious chances high and wide of the target. Brentford have been limited to just two efforts wide from Mbeumo and Hickey, but there's no denying their effort and organisation in defence is playing a big part in Chelsea's frustrations so far.
The teams return ahead of the second half, and after a first 45 minutes marred by missed chances, Chelsea will need to open the scoring as soon as they possibly can if they're to make that dominance count!
No changes from either side at the break, as Jackson and Palmer get the second period up and running for the hosts!
Brentford have now stopped their opposition from scoring a first-half goal in seven of their 10 Premier League games, second only to Crystal Palace's eight so far this season.
Palmer finds Cucurella on the run with a lofted pass to the left, but the Spaniard's cut-back for Sterling hits Ajer and goes behind for a corner!
SAVED!!! Ajer pops up in the box to connect with Roerslev's ball in behind, and cuts it back into the middle. Janelt arrives late to strike a first-time shot goalwards, but his effort is hit straight at Sanchez and the Chelsea goalkeeper makes the break!
Gallagher does brilliantly to win possession back in the find third with three red and white shirts around him, but his wide pass for Madueke deflects off Jensen and bobbles behind for a corner.
Silva attacks Gallagher's delivery into the box from the set-piece, but can't generate much power behind his header and Brentford easily deal with the threat!
BLOCKED!!! Sterling steps his way past two challenges before shooting from the edge of the area, but Pinnock slides in bravely to make a superb block! The ball is sent spiralling into the air, but the Brentford defender keeps his composure to nod beyond the reach of Sterling before thumping it clear.
Silva playing his 87th starting Premier League game, all coming aged 36 and over. That's the most by an outfield player in the competition's history.
Sterling's penalty shout against Ajer comes to nothing, and Brentford clear the ball out to the right. Cucurella and Mbeumo tussle for possession, but the Chelsea full-back is fouled on the touchline and wins a free-kick. Warming up Brentford substitute Neal Maupay delays the taking of Palmer's delivery, and the first yellow card of the game is shown to a player who's not even on the pitch!
Palmer's cross in from the left comes to nothing and the ball drops to Jackson on the edge of the box. He looks to pick his spot from the edge of the area, but sends his shot high and wide of Flekken's goal.
GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!! Brentford take a shock lead here!!! Following a throw-in, Roerslev and Mbeumo play a smart one-two down the right. The latter hangs a high cross towards the back post, where Pinnock arrives from nowhere to nod the ball home! Chelsea have had chance after chance after chance, but it's the Bees who lead 1-0 at Stamford Bridge!
What a ball from Mbeumo, taking every single Chelsea defender out of the picture and allowing his own centre-back to rise high and head Brentford in front!
Chelsea look to respond straight away as Sterling races into the area, but he's dispossessed as he tries to cut onto his right foot and Brentford have the ball back once more!
That goal was only Pinnock's second scored away from home in the Premier League, previously doing so in April of last season against Brighton, and his last three strikes overall in the league have all been set up by that man Mbeumo!
It's Brentford who'll make the first change of the game, taking Jensen off for Frank Onyeka in a like-for-like midfield substitution.
A loose touch from Pinnock in his own box is seized upon by Palmer, but the Brentford goalscorer recovers well to prevent a shot and put the ball behind for a corner.
Palmer looks up and sets off on a run into the box, gliding between four as he does so. His final touch is a poor one though, and the ball is nudged behind for a goal-kick.
Chelsea now make their first changes, with Disasi replaced at the back by the far more attack-minded option of club captain Reece James.
Madueke also heads off following a frustrating 67 minutes in front of goal, and Ian Maatsen is introduced to slot into the wide attacking positions.
An underhit Flekken goal-kick is knocked straight back towards the Brentford box by Gallagher, and Palmer latches onto it. Pinnock's onto him though, and gets a crucial touch to re-gain possession for the Bees.
CHANCE!!! Mbeumo drifts out to the left to collect a pass forward from Hickey, and squares for Wissa in the box. The Congolese striker has space to shoot, but a poor touch takes the chance away as Chelsea win it back!
Maatsen takes on Hickey and fires a low cross towards the front post, but it's Flekken's all day and the goalkeeper dives on the loose ball.
James crosses through the crowd to find Jackson on the edge of the six-yard box, but he can't pull off a good first touch either and loses the ball!
Only West Ham have opened the scoring in more different Premier League games than Brentford's seven so far this season, and although the Bees have won just two of the previous six, they're well on course to see out a third straight victory at Stamford Bridge!
Janelt's been his industrious self at both ends of the pitch for Brentford, but is withdrawn with 14 to go for Yehor Yarmolyuk.
Wissa also comes off having had little luck in the final third, and Neal Maupay, who don't forget is already on a yellow card, will replace him late on!
Caicedo leaves a foot in on Norgaard well after the ball has gone, and the Ecuadorian picks up Chelsea's first booking of the contest.
Roerslev's long throw into the box is quickly headed clear by Chelsea, but Pinnock is back in cover to thwart any potential counter-attack.
Caicedo comes off having just been booked for the Blues, and Lesley Ugochukwu will replace him at the base of Chelsea's midfield.
Cucurella is also withdrawn, with young Brazilian striker Deivid Washington brought on in his place as Chelsea look to salvage the game late on.
CHANCE!!! Sterling cuts inside from the left and whips a teasing cross to the back post, but the arriving Gallagher can't quite get there and the ball sails behind for a goal-kick!
Hickey is the latest player off for the Bees, and Saman Ghoddos, who scored late to seal the 3-0 win over Fulham last time out, replaces him. Lightning can't strike twice, can it?
The two number 15's come together as Jackson looks to burst clear on the break. Onyeka drags him back though, and is shown a textbook yellow card for the cynical foul.
CHANCE!!! Collins concedes a corner which is swung into the box by Gallagher. Silva's glancing header at the front post flashes across the face of goal, but Jackson can't turn the ball home and Chelsea's wait for a goal continues!
CHANCE!!! Maatsen escapes down the right and cuts the ball back from the byline. Both Palmer and Washington are in open space, but neither can direct the ball towards goal as another glorious opportunity passes Chelsea by!
Frustrations begin to boil over on the Chelsea bench, and Pochettino's assistant Jesus Perez has a word or two that the referee isn't a fan of whatsoever. He's promptly shown a red card, as things go from bad to worse for the Blues!
WHAT A SAVE!!! Sanchez keeps Chelsea in it as Brentford flood forward on the counter. They've got a four-on-one as Mbeumo feeds Yarmolyuk in the box, but the Blues 'keeper makes himself big to pull off a huge stop!
WIDE!! Brentford come straight back at Chelsea as Maupay drills a low cross into the six-yard box, but Mbeumo sends a first-time finish inches wide of the near post with the goal begging!
We're into SIX additional minutes at Stamford Bridge - hold on to your hats!
Roerslev nods behind for a late Chelsea corner, but it comes to nothing after Maatsen's shot from the edge of the area is blocked and cleared by desperate Bees defence!
Roerslev's block on Ugochukwu's shot sends the ball behind for another corner, which Ghoddos delays the taking of to earn himself a yellow card.
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!!! Brentford finish Chelsea off with the cruellest of late goals! The corner, which Sanchez has come forward for, is headed clear, and with no-one back, Maupay carries the ball over halfway on his own! Sanchez gives chase in vain, and Mbeumo is on hand to tap in the substitute's pass, making it 2-0 and sealing the points!
Maupay gets the easiest assist of his career with an unselfish pass. He could've easily put that in himself having taken the ball all the way!
The Brentford celebrations are understandably wild, and Norgaard oversteps the mark slightly to pick up a late booking.
FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 0-2 BRENTFORD.
It's all over at Stamford Bridge, as Brentford pile on the misery for a Chelsea side whose profligacy in front of goal came back to bite! Early second half chances for Cucurella and Sterling went astray, before Bees defender Pinnock headed Mbeumo's cross in at the far post to provide the ultimate sucker-punch. Chelsea then had to try and save the game, but Gallagher, Silva and Washington all fluffed their lines in front of goal, and further frustration off the pitch saw coach Pochettino and Jackson clash with a fan, as well as assistant Jesus Perez sent off. Brentford had numerous chances of their own, with Sanchez making saves from both Janelt and Yarmolyuk, and the Bees would finish with a flourish as Maupay and Mbeumo galloped over halfway for the latter to tap home. 2-0 victors Brentford secure back-to-back wins and climb above Chelsea to 10th in the table, while the wasteful Blues are now two games without victory ahead of a trip to league leaders Tottenham."	"Everton edged past Crystal Palace in a five-goal thriller at Selhurst Park as Idrissa Gueye's 86th-minute winner gave them a 3-2 win.
Vitalli Mykolenko scored the quickest goal of the season and Abdoulaye Doucoure also found the net as Everton twice recovered from being pegged back by Palace to secure a third away win in their last four Premier League matches.
For the second match running, Mykolenko gave Everton an early lead as he produced a thumping header on 54 seconds, the quickest goal in the Premier League this season.
That strike also meant Everton have scored an unmatched 13 goals inside the first minute in Premier League history.
However the Toffees’ lead did not last long as just over two minutes later Eberechi Eze showed wonderful skill to get past a few defenders before drawing a foul from Jarrad Branthwaite to earn a penalty.
Eze, who signed a new contract on Friday, stepped up and coolly slotted the spot-kick into the bottom-right corner.
Everton restored their lead after the break through Abdoulaye Doucoure. Mykolenko produced a fine volley from outside the area that cannoned off a post and into the path of Doucoure, who put it into an empty net.
But Palace fought back again through Odsonne Edouard’s fifth goal of the season thanks to a costly error by James Tarkowski.
Jefferson Lerma headed a clearance back into the area and Tarkowski looked to leave the ball for his goalkeeper, who had stayed on his line. Instead it gave Edouard the simple task of controlling the ball and putting it past Jordan Pickford.
The action was not done there though as Everton took the lead for a third time when Gueye scored his first goal in nearly two years.
He received a clever pass from Doucoure on the edge of the area before showing great composure to move away from Tyrick Mitchell and slide the ball into the corner in the 86th minute.
Everton held on for a vital three points that moved them up to 14th with 14 points. Palace drop to 12th, and are a point ahead of the Toffees.

Team_8	Team_9	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this fixture in the Premier League, as Team_7 host Team_4 in a west London derby at Stamford Bridge.
Mauricio Pochettino’s Team_7 have recovered from a poor start to the season and are unbeaten in their last three games, convincingly beating Team_10 and Team_6 away from home before a 2-2 draw with London rivals Team_1 last time out.
The Bees had been going through a rough patch of their own, not winning in six since beating Team_10 3-0 in the second game of the season. Three draws and losses apiece followed, but Thomas Frank’s side returned to form in their most recent home game, defeating Team_6 3-0.
Team_7 (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez; Marc Cucurella, Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo; Noni Madueke, Cole Palmer, Raheem Sterling; Nicolas Jackson.
Team_7 SUBS: Djordje Petrovic, Eddie Beach, Benoit Badiashile, Lesley Ugochukwu, Reece James, Malo Gusto, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington, Alex Matos.
Team_4 (3-5-2): Mark Flekken; Kristoffer Ajer, Ethan Pinnock, Nathan Collins; Mads Roerslev, Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt, Aaron Hickey; Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa.
Team_4 SUBS: Thomas Strakosha, Neal Maupay, Zanka Jorgensen, Saman Ghoddos, Frank Onyeka, Ben Mee, Yehor Yarmolyuk, Michael Olakigbe, Ethan Brierley.
Team_7 make three changes from the side held to a draw by Team_1, with Senegalese striker Nicolas Jackson back leading the line following a wrist injury. Axel Disasi and Noni Madueke join the defence and attacking midfield lines respectively, with Malo Gusto on the bench and Enzo Fernandez and Mykhailo Mudryk surprisingly absent from the squad.
Aaron Hickey is back in the Team_4 XI following a one-match ban, and slots in at left wing-back in one of two changes. Mads Roerslev occupies the opposite flank for the Bees, with Neal Maupay and Frank Onyeka shifting to the bench.
Gallagher and Norgaard lead their respective teams out of the tunnel, and we're almost ready to go at Stamford Bridge!
Following a minute's applause to honour the life of England's World Cup-winning hero Bobby Charlton, Team_4 get the game underway as Jensen kicks off!
Team_4 have won both of their Premier League away games against Team_7 – no team has ever won their first three games at Stamford Bridge in the history of the competition.
CHANCE!!! Team_7 break at speed after a long throw from Roerslev comes to nothing. Sterling canters over halfway and finds Palmer to his right, but the youngster's return ball into the box is just a fraction behind the England winger and Team_4 survive!
Team_7 have won just two of their last 12 London derbies in the Premier League, beating Team_8 1-0 in January and Team_10 2-0 earlier this month. The Blues threw away a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with Team_1 in their most recent match.
WIDE!!! Cucurella and Jackson combine down the left and the Team_7 striker cuts inside looking for shooting space. He fires an effort goalwards from the edge of the box, but it's safe enough for Flekken to leave as the ball curls around the far post!
CHANCE!! Mbeumo is put in behind the defence by Janelt's pass, but the Team_4 forward is forced to shoot from a tight angle and smashes the ball into the side netting! Mbeumo wants a corner but it doesn't come, as Sanchez picks the ball up quickly looking to spark a counter-attack!
OFF THE WOODWORK!!! The Team_7 counter-attack almost works a treat, as Sanchez's out-ball is played forward by Gallagher to Madueke. He steps onto his left foot and curls a shot towards goal, which has Flekken beaten all ends up before bouncing back off the crossbar!
Roerslev's low cross off a wide pass from Wissa is cut out, and Team_7 set off on the break once more. It's played across to Sterling, who tees up Madueke, but his latest effort is well blocked by Collins!
SAVED!!! Collins gets in the way of another effort, this time from Jackson, but Team_7 just keep on coming at the Bees. Gallagher finds shooting space and lets fly from 25 yards, but Flekken gets down well to parry his low drive away from danger!
Team_7 have won more points (seven) and scored more goals (eight) in their last three Premier League games than they did in their previous nine beforehand (six points, seven goals). Building.
Hickey slides in to dispossess Madueke with a crunching tackle that sparks a fast break down the left for Team_4, but play is soon brought back with the Team_7 winger down injured.
Team_7 pile numbers into the final third, looking to open Team_4 up, but neither Sterling nor Jackson can pick out that defence-splitting pass with the Bees able to withstand the pressure.
SAVED!!! Team_7 spurn their best chance yet to go ahead!! Palmer's scooped ball into the six-yard box is met by the arriving Cucurella on the fly, but he can only volley straight into the midriff of Flekken!
OVER!!! Madueke and Palmer combine on the edge of the box for the latter to put Sterling through on goal, but it's blazed over the top from close range by the winger in a chance that looked easier to score than miss!
Sterling picks out Palmer with a lofted pass into the box, but Pinnock and Roerslev combine to win the ball back and clear for Team_4.
Disasi's throughball into the box opens Team_4 up and gives Sterling space to cross, but neither Palmer nor Gallagher can connect and another chance goes begging!
Sterling goes down under pressure from Roerslev as the pair contest another reverse ball into the box from Palmer, but both the on-field referee and VAR are in agreement that the contact wasn't worthy of a penalty.
Flekken launches a long Team_4 free-kick into the box, but Wissa's attempt at a shot is cleared and forward come Team_7. Jackson leads the charge, but Roerslev and Mbeumo get back at speed to win the ball for the Bees.
Team_4 are unbeaten in their last 12 Premier League London derbies, winning six, which is their longest run without defeat against London sides in history. Away from home they’ve won their last three such games, never winning four in a row on the road before.
Sterling darts around the outside of Roerslev and drills a low cross into the box, but Pinnock steps in to put the ball behind for the game's very first corner!
Team_7 win a second successive corner on the opposite side, but Gallagher's attempt to play the ball short to Palmer is easily read and dealt with by Mbeumo.
Sterling spots the run of Caicedo and dinks the ball towards the back post, but it's far too close to Flekken and the Team_4 goalkeeper collects.
CHANCE!!! Disasi fires a low ball at pace to the feet of Jackson, but the striker can't quite connect before the pass is dived upon by Flekken for the Bees!
After Madueke's surging run into the box is thwarted by Hickey, Team_7 look to the left side, but Gallagher's cross-field ball to Sterling can't be kept in the field of play by the England winger!
WIDE!!! Another golden chance for the Blues! Cucurella's floated cross into the box is met by Ajer, but his flicked header only falls to Madueke. Unmarked at the far post, the winger fires goalwards, but blasts the ball past the wrong side of the right-hand post!
CHANCE!!! Madueke's cut-back from the byline is met late by Cucurella arriving in the centre, but he can't strike the ball cleanly and it loops straight into Flekken's gloves!
Janelt's pass forward is deflected into the path of Mbeumo, who crosses towards the far post. Hickey's following in and has space to shoot, but his attempt to chest the ball down sends it over the line and behind!
Colwill's block from an Mbeumo cross gives Team_4 their first corner of the game, but the delivery is easily nodded down and dealt with by the hosts.
OVER!!! Wissa drags Caicedo down on the edge of Team_4 box, gifting Team_7 a free-kick from 20 yards. Palmer steps up on set-piece duty, but can only send a curling finish over the top of Flekken's goal!
We'll play two additional minutes to close out this (somehow) goalless first half at Stamford Bridge.
A foot injury to Jensen takes a minute or so for the Team_4 medical team to deal with, meaning we'll likely run beyond the allocated minutes at the end of this half.
HALF-TIME: Team_7 0-0 Team_4.
We're all square at the break, with hosts Team_7 having done everything but score in the first 45 minutes! It's been one-way traffic for much of the half, but despite Team_7 piling numbers forward at every available opportunity, they've been unable to beat Flekken or force him into any difficult saves of note. The Bees keeper has been called into action by Gallagher and Cucurella's shots on goal, and Madueke has struck the crossbar, but Jackson, Sterling and Madueke again have all put glorious chances high and wide of the target. Team_4 have been limited to just two efforts wide from Mbeumo and Hickey, but there's no denying their effort and organisation in defence is playing a big part in Team_7 frustrations so far.
The teams return ahead of the second half, and after a first 45 minutes marred by missed chances, Team_7 will need to open the scoring as soon as they possibly can if they're to make that dominance count!
No changes from either side at the break, as Jackson and Palmer get the second period up and running for the hosts!
Team_4 have now stopped their opposition from scoring a first-half goal in seven of their 10 Premier League games, second only to Team_8 eight so far this season.
Palmer finds Cucurella on the run with a lofted pass to the left, but the Spaniard's cut-back for Sterling hits Ajer and goes behind for a corner!
SAVED!!! Ajer pops up in the box to connect with Roerslev's ball in behind, and cuts it back into the middle. Janelt arrives late to strike a first-time shot goalwards, but his effort is hit straight at Sanchez and the Team_7 goalkeeper makes the break!
Gallagher does brilliantly to win possession back in the find third with three red and white shirts around him, but his wide pass for Madueke deflects off Jensen and bobbles behind for a corner.
Silva attacks Gallagher's delivery into the box from the set-piece, but can't generate much power behind his header and Team_4 easily deal with the threat!
BLOCKED!!! Sterling steps his way past two challenges before shooting from the edge of the area, but Pinnock slides in bravely to make a superb block! The ball is sent spiralling into the air, but the Team_4 defender keeps his composure to nod beyond the reach of Sterling before thumping it clear.
Silva playing his 87th starting Premier League game, all coming aged 36 and over. That's the most by an outfield player in the competition's history.
Sterling's penalty shout against Ajer comes to nothing, and Team_4 clear the ball out to the right. Cucurella and Mbeumo tussle for possession, but the Team_7 full-back is fouled on the touchline and wins a free-kick. Warming up Team_4 substitute Neal Maupay delays the taking of Palmer's delivery, and the first yellow card of the game is shown to a player who's not even on the pitch!
Palmer's cross in from the left comes to nothing and the ball drops to Jackson on the edge of the box. He looks to pick his spot from the edge of the area, but sends his shot high and wide of Flekken's goal.
GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!! Team_4 take a shock lead here!!! Following a throw-in, Roerslev and Mbeumo play a smart one-two down the right. The latter hangs a high cross towards the back post, where Pinnock arrives from nowhere to nod the ball home! Team_7 have had chance after chance after chance, but it's the Bees who lead 1-0 at Stamford Bridge!
What a ball from Mbeumo, taking every single Team_7 defender out of the picture and allowing his own centre-back to rise high and head Team_4 in front!
Team_7 look to respond straight away as Sterling races into the area, but he's dispossessed as he tries to cut onto his right foot and Team_4 have the ball back once more!
That goal was only Pinnock's second scored away from home in the Premier League, previously doing so in April of last season against Team_5, and his last three strikes overall in the league have all been set up by that man Mbeumo!
It's Team_4 who'll make the first change of the game, taking Jensen off for Frank Onyeka in a like-for-like midfield substitution.
A loose touch from Pinnock in his own box is seized upon by Palmer, but the Team_4 goalscorer recovers well to prevent a shot and put the ball behind for a corner.
Palmer looks up and sets off on a run into the box, gliding between four as he does so. His final touch is a poor one though, and the ball is nudged behind for a goal-kick.
Team_7 now make their first changes, with Disasi replaced at the back by the far more attack-minded option of club captain Reece James.
Madueke also heads off following a frustrating 67 minutes in front of goal, and Ian Maatsen is introduced to slot into the wide attacking positions.
An underhit Flekken goal-kick is knocked straight back towards the Team_4 box by Gallagher, and Palmer latches onto it. Pinnock's onto him though, and gets a crucial touch to re-gain possession for the Bees.
CHANCE!!! Mbeumo drifts out to the left to collect a pass forward from Hickey, and squares for Wissa in the box. The Congolese striker has space to shoot, but a poor touch takes the chance away as Team_7 win it back!
Maatsen takes on Hickey and fires a low cross towards the front post, but it's Flekken's all day and the goalkeeper dives on the loose ball.
James crosses through the crowd to find Jackson on the edge of the six-yard box, but he can't pull off a good first touch either and loses the ball!
Only Team_19 have opened the scoring in more different Premier League games than Team_4 seven so far this season, and although the Bees have won just two of the previous six, they're well on course to see out a third straight victory at Stamford Bridge!
Janelt's been his industrious self at both ends of the pitch for Team_4, but is withdrawn with 14 to go for Yehor Yarmolyuk.
Wissa also comes off having had little luck in the final third, and Neal Maupay, who don't forget is already on a yellow card, will replace him late on!
Caicedo leaves a foot in on Norgaard well after the ball has gone, and the Ecuadorian picks up Team_7 first booking of the contest.
Roerslev's long throw into the box is quickly headed clear by Team_7, but Pinnock is back in cover to thwart any potential counter-attack.
Caicedo comes off having just been booked for the Blues, and Lesley Ugochukwu will replace him at the base of Team_7 midfield.
Cucurella is also withdrawn, with young Brazilian striker Deivid Washington brought on in his place as Team_7 look to salvage the game late on.
CHANCE!!! Sterling cuts inside from the left and whips a teasing cross to the back post, but the arriving Gallagher can't quite get there and the ball sails behind for a goal-kick!
Hickey is the latest player off for the Bees, and Saman Ghoddos, who scored late to seal the 3-0 win over Team_10 last time out, replaces him. Lightning can't strike twice, can it?
The two number 15's come together as Jackson looks to burst clear on the break. Onyeka drags him back though, and is shown a textbook yellow card for the cynical foul.
CHANCE!!! Collins concedes a corner which is swung into the box by Gallagher. Silva's glancing header at the front post flashes across the face of goal, but Jackson can't turn the ball home and Team_7 wait for a goal continues!
CHANCE!!! Maatsen escapes down the right and cuts the ball back from the byline. Both Palmer and Washington are in open space, but neither can direct the ball towards goal as another glorious opportunity passes Team_7 by!
Frustrations begin to boil over on the Team_7 bench, and Pochettino's assistant Jesus Perez has a word or two that the referee isn't a fan of whatsoever. He's promptly shown a red card, as things go from bad to worse for the Blues!
WHAT A SAVE!!! Sanchez keeps Team_7 in it as Team_4 flood forward on the counter. They've got a four-on-one as Mbeumo feeds Yarmolyuk in the box, but the Blues 'keeper makes himself big to pull off a huge stop!
WIDE!! Team_4 come straight back at Team_7 as Maupay drills a low cross into the six-yard box, but Mbeumo sends a first-time finish inches wide of the near post with the goal begging!
We're into SIX additional minutes at Stamford Bridge - hold on to your hats!
Roerslev nods behind for a late Team_7 corner, but it comes to nothing after Maatsen's shot from the edge of the area is blocked and cleared by desperate Bees defence!
Roerslev's block on Ugochukwu's shot sends the ball behind for another corner, which Ghoddos delays the taking of to earn himself a yellow card.
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!!! Team_4 finish Team_7 off with the cruellest of late goals! The corner, which Sanchez has come forward for, is headed clear, and with no-one back, Maupay carries the ball over halfway on his own! Sanchez gives chase in vain, and Mbeumo is on hand to tap in the substitute's pass, making it 2-0 and sealing the points!
Maupay gets the easiest assist of his career with an unselfish pass. He could've easily put that in himself having taken the ball all the way!
The Team_4 celebrations are understandably wild, and Norgaard oversteps the mark slightly to pick up a late booking.
FULL-TIME: Team_7 0-2 Team_4.
It's all over at Stamford Bridge, as Team_4 pile on the misery for a Team_7 side whose profligacy in front of goal came back to bite! Early second half chances for Cucurella and Sterling went astray, before Bees defender Pinnock headed Mbeumo's cross in at the far post to provide the ultimate sucker-punch. Team_7 then had to try and save the game, but Gallagher, Silva and Washington all fluffed their lines in front of goal, and further frustration off the pitch saw coach Pochettino and Jackson clash with a fan, as well as assistant Jesus Perez sent off. Team_4 had numerous chances of their own, with Sanchez making saves from both Janelt and Yarmolyuk, and the Bees would finish with a flourish as Maupay and Mbeumo galloped over halfway for the latter to tap home. 2-0 victors Team_4 secure back-to-back wins and climb above Team_7 to 10th in the table, while the wasteful Blues are now two games without victory ahead of a trip to league leaders Team_18."	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93566	Man City	Chelsea	2024-02-17	Etihad Stadium, Manchester	53509.0	Andy Madley	"Hello and welcome everyone to live text coverage of the Premier League match between Everton and Tottenham at Goodison Park.
We are set for a showdown between two teams at opposite ends of the table. Everton, who are 18th, will move out of the relegation zone with a draw today. Meanwhile, fourth-place Tottenham are looking to consolidate their position among the Champions League places.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ben Godfrey, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Ashley Young, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner, Dwight McNeil; Jack Harrison; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
SUBS: Joao Virginia, Michael Keane, Nathan Patterson, Seamus Coleman, Mackenzie Hunt, Jenson Metcalfe, Lewis Dobbin, Beto, Youssef Chermiti.
TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Rodrigo Bentancur; Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner; Richarlison.
SUBS: Fraser Forster, Emerson Royal, Ben Davies, Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Oliver Skipp, Pape Sarr, Bryan Gil, Dane Scarlett.
Sean Dyche makes a single change from Everton's 0-0 draw with Fulham in midweek. Back from the Africa Cup of Nations, Gueye replaces injured ex-Tottenham midfielder Danjuma, while Coleman returns from a hamstring injury on the bench. Abdoulaye Doucoure, Amadou Onana, Andre Gomes and Dele Alli are among the Toffees absentees.
Meanwhile, Ange Postecoglou makes two changes from Tottenham's victory over Brentford last time out. Johnson and Hojbjerg, who appeared as half-time substitutes in that game, come into the starting line-up with Kulusevski and Skipp dropping to the bench. Pape Sarr returns from the Africa Cup of Nations on the bench, but Heung-Min Son and Yves Bissouma are still away on international duty. Manor Solomon, Ryan Sessegnon, Giovani Lo Celso and Alejo Veliz are absent through injury.
Tottenham are unbeaten in each of their last 10 Premier League visits to Goodison Park, where a 2-1 defeat in December 2012 represents their most recent reverse.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch and we are almost ready to go at Goodison Park.
Michael Oliver is our referee today. He blows his whistle and Everton get us under way.
Maddison whips the ball towards Richarlison in the box, but Keane gets his head there first to divert it away from his former team-mate.
RICHARLISON!!! 1-0 TOTTENHAM! The former Everton forward comes back to haunt his old club! Following a neat build-up down the left, Udogie is released into space and shows great awareness to pull the ball back for Richarlison, who sweeps a wonderful first-time volley into the roof of the net.
Udogie got away down the left flank and picked out Richarlison, who broke the deadlock.
Everton look to respond immediately and Young's deep cross finds Calvert-Lewin, but the striker is unable to keep his header down.
Richarlison deserves credit for deliberately not celebrating against his old club. In breaking the deadlock, he becomes the first ex-Everton player to score home and away against them in the same Premier League season.
CLOSE! Everton are sloppy in possession and Tottenham look to punish them. Richarlison feeds Maddison, who advances towards the edge of the penalty area, before his eventual shot deflects narrowly wide via Tarkowski.
Tottenham threaten to double their lead from a corner. It is only cleared as far as Hojbjerg, but he cannot get over his first-time volley, which is never going to trouble Pickford.
Tarkowski invites unwanted pressure on Everton with a loose backpass chased by Richarlison. Thankfully for the defender, Pickford is alert and quickly races out of goal to tidy up the situation.
The Toffees have the opportunity to threaten as they are awarded a free-kick after McNeil's strong run is halted by Hojbjerg, albeit unfairly.
Everton look to turn up the pressure after forcing a corner. The inswinging delivery is right into the heart of the six-yard box, but Vicario does well to punch clear under pressure.
GET OUT OF THE WAY! A patient build-up from Everton culminates in McNeil volleying Mykolenko's cross towards goal, only for the unfortunately placed Harrison to unwittingly block it. Thankfully for him, the offside flag is subsequently raised, so any goal would not have counted anyway.
Following three successive 0-0 draws, Everton are aiming to avoid going four consecutive Premier League matches without scoring for the first time in two years. Although it came to nothing, that opportunity will have encouraged them.
The hosts push again and Gueye releases Calvert-Lewin, though Van de Ven does well to track his run before making a well-timed sliding challenge. However, the offside flag goes up against the Everton striker.
Everton continue to look for the equaliser. McNeil's deep corner is met by Calvert-Lewin at the far post, but there is no easy route to goal through the crowded six-yard box, and he heads wide.
A nervy moment from Pickford. Receiving the ball outside the area, he hesitates under pressure from Maddison, but just about recovers to clear his lines.
Pickford recorded his 70th Premier League clean sheet in midweek, becoming the ninth English goalkeeper to achieve the feat. Only Ederson, David de Gea, Hugo Lloris and Alisson have registered more since his debut in January 2016, although the England stopper has faced over 200 more shots on target in that time.
HARRISON!!! 1-1! EVERTON ARE LEVEL! The hosts make their pressure tell after another deep McNeil corner causes problems for Spurs. Vicario cannot punch clear and Tarkowski heads the ball back across the six-yard box. Calvert-Lewin and Harrison both go for it, but the latter gets the final touch to send it into an empty net.
Tarkowski reacted quickly to head the ball back into the danger area for Harrison to apply the finishing touch.
We are all square at Goodison Park, where the sigh of relief among the home fans was evident as their side dragged themselves level. There was a nervous wait while VAR checked there were no infringements against Vicario, or that Harrison had touched the ball from an offside position. Thankfully for the hosts, the goal was eventually given.
There is a break in play with Gueye staying down and in need of attention. Recently back from the Africa Cup of Nations, Everton will hope this is nothing too serious. It does not look like it, though.
After making his way to the touchline, Gueye is given the green light to continue and returns to the action looking to help Everton end their five-game winless streak in the Premier League.
Tottenham are the side whose away games have featured the most Premier League goals since the start of last season. We are currently on 115 and counting.
RICHARLISON!!! 2-1 TOTTENHAM! The former Everton man strikes again, and it is another beauty! The ball will not quite break for Spurs in the box, but it eventually comes to Maddison, who lays it off for Richarlison. The Brazilian has space to take aim and brilliantly bend the ball into the far corner from 20 yards out.
Maddison laid the ball back for Richarlison, who doubled his tally and restored Spurs' lead.
Once again, there were no celebrations from Richarlison, who has scored in four successive Premier League games for the first time since March 2021. His mixed feelings at finding the net against his former club once more were evident.
Everton look to respond before the break and Harrison seeks out Calvert-Lewin in the box. However, the recovering Porro does well to shield the ball away from the Toffees striker and into Vicario's arms.
Good recovery! Romero's loose pass goes straight to Gueye, who drives towards the Tottenham box before taking aim. Thankfully for the visitors, Hojbjerg manages to get a toe to the ball to deflect the shot wide for a corner.
GREAT SAVE! Wonderful reflexes from Vicario! Everton look to equalise as we enter the first of five additional minutes at the end of the first half. Garner's deep corner is met by Godfrey inside the six-yard box, but Vicario does brilliantly to keep out the header.
The hosts continue to press for the leveller from another corner. Once again, Tottenham are under pressure, but can eventually relax when Maddison is fouled in the area.
A fine strike from Mykolenko just inside the box stings Vicario's palms. It was a wonderful hit by the full-back, but it would not have counted as the referee had blown the whistle for Calvert-Lewin's foul on Johnson.
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 1-2 TOTTENHAM
It has been a pulsating first half at Goodison Park, where a former Everton man has come back to haunt his old side. Richarlison opened the scoring after just four minutes with a well-taken volley. Harrison levelled on the half-hour mark when he forced the ball home from close range, but Richarlison restored Spurs' lead four minutes before the break with a wonderful curling 20-yard strike. On both occasions, the Brazil forward refused to celebrate against his former employers, who must look to respond after the break.
Everton have registered double the amount of shots on goal (eight) compared to Tottenham. Although, the difference is that three of Spurs' four attempts were on target, as opposed to just two from eight for the hosts. That is something they must address in the second half to stand any chance of fighting back.
The referee blows his whistle and we are off and running again at Goodison Park.
Everton make a purposeful start to the second half and force an early corner. Although, Tottenham are alert and deal with the danger.
GOOD SAVE! Porro finds himself in an advanced position and lets fly with a powerful strike from outside the penalty area. It is on target, but Pickford gets across well to palm it away.
Brilliant defending! Godfrey suddenly turns defence into attack with his long ball releasing Harrison in behind. However, Van de Ven makes up ground before a perfectly timed sliding challenge denies the Everton man.
Maddison is pulling Tottenham's strings as his throughball releases Werner, who is blocked by Pickford. Although, the offside flag is subsequently raised against the former Chelsea forward.
A concern for Spurs as Richarlison stays down following a strong challenge near the Everton area. The forward is in need of attention, but eventually returns to his feet.
Great defending! Johnson shows great vision as he sweeps the ball across the penalty area towards the onrushing Werner. However, Godfrey gets back well to make a well-timed sliding challenge and deny the forward a shot on goal.
GREAT STRIKE! Godfrey heads Porro's cross straight to Maddison on the edge of the box. The Tottenham attacking midfielder unleashes a fierce left-footed volley that is flashing towards the bottom-right corner, but Pickford gets across well to beat it away.
Godfrey vents his frustration towards the officials after he is penalised for a foul. Although, the Everton defender does so too aggressively for the liking of the referee, who books him.
There appears to be activity on the Tottenham bench with Postecoglou looking to freshen his side up heading towards the final 25 minutes.
Here come those changes. One of them sees Johnson make way to be replaced by Kulusevski.
Sarr also comes on following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations. Bentancur is the player to make way.
Suddenly, Tottenham can counter with Maddison leading the charge towards the penalty area. However, he runs out of steam and Everton can recover the ball.
Spurs remain 2-1 to the good as we enter the final quarter of this contest. Can they hold out for all three points, or will Everton respond?
GOOD SAVE! Pickford denies Richarlison a hat-trick! The Everton goalkeeper comes to his side's rescue, producing a strong reflex save to keep out his former team-mate's powerful strike from inside the area.
Tarkowski catches Richarlison on the back of the head as the pair contest an aerial ball. The Tottenham forward goes down and the medical team are on to check him over.
Thankfully for Spurs, Richarlison is fine to continue. Meanwhile, Godfrey is just receiving attention from Everton's staff. The hosts do have Coleman on the bench if needed.
Godfrey cannot continue and Coleman comes on in his place for the final quarter of an hour.
Tottenham are looking to manage the game and preserve their lead as they knock the ball around and neatly maintain possession, without threatening the Everton defence.
The visitors attack down the left flank with Werner taking on Coleman. However, he gets his cross all wrong and sends the ball behind for a goal kick.
Dyche makes another change as Young makes way to be replaced by Chermiti.
Tottenham have won more Premier League games (30) and scored more Premier League goals (102) against Everton than they have any other side. Spurs are closing in on extending that impressive run here.
Everton make two more changes. The first of these sees Beto introduced in favour of Calvert-Lewin.
Dobbin also comes on for the last five minutes with McNeil making way.
There is also activity on the Tottenham bench. A conservative change sees Skipp replace Werner.
Maddison is also given a breather by Postecoglou with Gil coming on.
CHANCE! Dobbin immediately involved as he cuts in from the left before delivering an inviting cross. Chermiti beats the offside trap to meet it, but cannot steer the ball either side of Vicario.
Hojbjerg is given a breather by Spurs with Dragusin replacing him for the final few moments.
No penalty! Everton appeal as Beto goes to ground under a challenge from Dragusin. However, the referee is not interested at all.
We are going to play seven minutes of stoppage time at the end of this game. Can Everton snatch a dramatic equaliser, or will Spurs hold on?
Garner is shown a yellow card by the referee.
The home fans are far from happy after the referee waves play on following Dragusin's barge on Beto. However, they are eventually awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position when Kulusevski trips Garner.
BRANTHWAITE!!! 2-2! EVERTON EQUALISE! The hosts may well have snatched a point at Goodison Park. A free-kick into the box deflects towards goal after glancing off Romero's head. The unmarked Branthwaite races onto the ball and nods past Vicario from close range.
Late drama here as Everton force themselves level in the dying moments. The hosts waited with their hearts in their mouths due to a VAR review, which eventually ruled Branthwaite was onside when the free-kick was taken and that the goal could stand.
Dobbin catches Dragusin late and has his name taken by the referee.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 2-2 TOTTENHAM
Everton move out of the Premier League relegation zone after Jarrad Branthwaite's stoppage-time equaliser rescues a point against Tottenham. Despite an xG of 0.91 compared to 2.5 from their opponents, the visitors looked set to leave Goodison Park with all three points after a brace from former Toffee Richarlison sandwiched Jack Harrison's close-range effort. However, the hosts snatched a share of the spoils in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Branthwaite nodded home from inside the six-yard box. All in all, the Toffees will feel that's the least they deserved, since the xG was 2.50 to 0.91 in their favour. Despite the draw, things do not get any easier for Sean Dyche's side, who travel to the Etihad Stadium next Saturday to face Manchester City, while Tottenham welcome Brighton and Hove Albion on the same day. Thanks for joining us today. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Manchester City fell behind in the title race when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea. 
Raheem Sterling got on the scoresheet against his former side and Chelsea, after missing several chances to double their lead, conceded a late equaliser to Rodri. 
It means that after victories for Liverpool and Arsenal earlier in the day, City drop to third, four points behind leaders Liverpool, having played a match fewer.
How the match unfolded
Both managers made two changes. Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker replaced Matheus Nunes and John Stones for City, while Levi Colwill and Sterling came in for Thiago Silva and Noni Madueke for Chelsea.
Erling Haaland missed a great chance to open the scoring in the 12th minute but headed over Julian Alvarez’s cross.
Nicolas Jackson then had a better chance for Chelsea 10 minutes later when Malo Gusto sent in a low cross, but the striker’s first touch was poor and Ederson collected the loose ball.
Chelsea managed to break the deadlock three minutes before half-time in similar fashion to Jackson’s miss. Jackson this time sprinted down the right before squaring the ball to Sterling, who cut inside past Walker and found the far corner against his former side.
Jackson almost turned the ball into his own net soon after from a corner, but Axel Disasi was on hand to clear the ball off the line. It meant that City trailed at home at half-time for the first time in 13 months.
De Bruyne went close for City very early in the second half, but his free-kick whistled over the bar.
Chelsea were also a threat and a well-worked move had Gusto sliding the ball across the six-yard box, but Sterling saw his shot saved well by Ederson, who did well to stop Ben Chilwell’s follow-up shot with his legs.
City started to lay siege to the Chelsea goal and Haaland saw a close-range shot blocked by Levi Colwill.
Then Djordje Petrovic made a brilliant save at his near post to keep out Haaland after his strike was deflected by Disasi. It was Haaland’s seventh shot of the match, his most in a Premier League fixture without scoring from one of them.
Chelsea then broke down the right again and Gallagher set up Christopher Nkunku but the substitute’s shot was blocked before Jackson and Enzo Fernandez got in each other’s way with the follow-up.
Guardiola had his head in his hands after Haaland squandered another great chance. De Bruyne found his team-mate with a brilliant left-footed cross, but Haaland’s header from eight yards inexplicably went over.
In total the Norwegian had 10 shots in the match, the most he has had in a Premier League fixture.
But City’s constant pressure paid off as Rodri, once more, came up clutch with their 27th shot. 
After Kyle Walker’s effort had been blocked, the ball fell to the Spaniard and his powerful drive from just inside the area was deflected past Petrovic in the 83rd minute.
City pushed for a winner and appealed for a penalty in the fourth minute of stoppage time after the ball struck the arm of Colwill, but it was not given after a VAR check.
Chelsea return to 10th on 35 points after Wolverhampton Wanderers briefly overtook them earlier in the day."	Team_13	Team_7	"Hello and welcome everyone to live text coverage of the Premier League match between Team_9 and Team_18 at Goodison Park.
We are set for a showdown between two teams at opposite ends of the table. Team_9, who are 18th, will move out of the relegation zone with a draw today. Meanwhile, fourth-place Team_18 are looking to consolidate their position among the Champions League places.
Team_9 (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ben Godfrey, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Ashley Young, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner, Dwight McNeil; Jack Harrison; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
SUBS: Joao Virginia, Michael Keane, Nathan Patterson, Seamus Coleman, Mackenzie Hunt, Jenson Metcalfe, Lewis Dobbin, Beto, Youssef Chermiti.
Team_18 (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Rodrigo Bentancur; Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner; Richarlison.
SUBS: Fraser Forster, Emerson Royal, Ben Davies, Radu Dragusin, Dejan Kulusevski, Oliver Skipp, Pape Sarr, Bryan Gil, Dane Scarlett.
Sean Dyche makes a single change from Team_9 0-0 draw with Team_10 in midweek. Back from the Africa Cup of Nations, Gueye replaces injured ex-Team_18 midfielder Danjuma, while Coleman returns from a hamstring injury on the bench. Abdoulaye Doucoure, Amadou Onana, Andre Gomes and Dele Alli are among the Toffees absentees.
Meanwhile, Ange Postecoglou makes two changes from Team_18 victory over Team_4 last time out. Johnson and Hojbjerg, who appeared as half-time substitutes in that game, come into the starting line-up with Kulusevski and Skipp dropping to the bench. Pape Sarr returns from the Africa Cup of Nations on the bench, but Heung-Min Son and Yves Bissouma are still away on international duty. Manor Solomon, Ryan Sessegnon, Giovani Lo Celso and Alejo Veliz are absent through injury.
Team_18 are unbeaten in each of their last 10 Premier League visits to Goodison Park, where a 2-1 defeat in December 2012 represents their most recent reverse.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch and we are almost ready to go at Goodison Park.
Michael Oliver is our referee today. He blows his whistle and Team_9 get us under way.
Maddison whips the ball towards Richarlison in the box, but Keane gets his head there first to divert it away from his former team-mate.
RICHARLISON!!! 1-0 Team_18! The former Team_9 forward comes back to haunt his old club! Following a neat build-up down the left, Udogie is released into space and shows great awareness to pull the ball back for Richarlison, who sweeps a wonderful first-time volley into the roof of the net.
Udogie got away down the left flank and picked out Richarlison, who broke the deadlock.
Team_9 look to respond immediately and Young's deep cross finds Calvert-Lewin, but the striker is unable to keep his header down.
Richarlison deserves credit for deliberately not celebrating against his old club. In breaking the deadlock, he becomes the first ex-Team_9 player to score home and away against them in the same Premier League season.
CLOSE! Team_9 are sloppy in possession and Team_18 look to punish them. Richarlison feeds Maddison, who advances towards the edge of the penalty area, before his eventual shot deflects narrowly wide via Tarkowski.
Team_18 threaten to double their lead from a corner. It is only cleared as far as Hojbjerg, but he cannot get over his first-time volley, which is never going to trouble Pickford.
Tarkowski invites unwanted pressure on Team_9 with a loose backpass chased by Richarlison. Thankfully for the defender, Pickford is alert and quickly races out of goal to tidy up the situation.
The Toffees have the opportunity to threaten as they are awarded a free-kick after McNeil's strong run is halted by Hojbjerg, albeit unfairly.
Team_9 look to turn up the pressure after forcing a corner. The inswinging delivery is right into the heart of the six-yard box, but Vicario does well to punch clear under pressure.
GET OUT OF THE WAY! A patient build-up from Team_9 culminates in McNeil volleying Mykolenko's cross towards goal, only for the unfortunately placed Harrison to unwittingly block it. Thankfully for him, the offside flag is subsequently raised, so any goal would not have counted anyway.
Following three successive 0-0 draws, Team_9 are aiming to avoid going four consecutive Premier League matches without scoring for the first time in two years. Although it came to nothing, that opportunity will have encouraged them.
The hosts push again and Gueye releases Calvert-Lewin, though Van de Ven does well to track his run before making a well-timed sliding challenge. However, the offside flag goes up against the Team_9 striker.
Team_9 continue to look for the equaliser. McNeil's deep corner is met by Calvert-Lewin at the far post, but there is no easy route to goal through the crowded six-yard box, and he heads wide.
A nervy moment from Pickford. Receiving the ball outside the area, he hesitates under pressure from Maddison, but just about recovers to clear his lines.
Pickford recorded his 70th Premier League clean sheet in midweek, becoming the ninth English goalkeeper to achieve the feat. Only Ederson, David de Gea, Hugo Lloris and Alisson have registered more since his debut in January 2016, although the England stopper has faced over 200 more shots on target in that time.
HARRISON!!! 1-1! Team_9 ARE LEVEL! The hosts make their pressure tell after another deep McNeil corner causes problems for Spurs. Vicario cannot punch clear and Tarkowski heads the ball back across the six-yard box. Calvert-Lewin and Harrison both go for it, but the latter gets the final touch to send it into an empty net.
Tarkowski reacted quickly to head the ball back into the danger area for Harrison to apply the finishing touch.
We are all square at Goodison Park, where the sigh of relief among the home fans was evident as their side dragged themselves level. There was a nervous wait while VAR checked there were no infringements against Vicario, or that Harrison had touched the ball from an offside position. Thankfully for the hosts, the goal was eventually given.
There is a break in play with Gueye staying down and in need of attention. Recently back from the Africa Cup of Nations, Team_9 will hope this is nothing too serious. It does not look like it, though.
After making his way to the touchline, Gueye is given the green light to continue and returns to the action looking to help Team_9 end their five-game winless streak in the Premier League.
Team_18 are the side whose away games have featured the most Premier League goals since the start of last season. We are currently on 115 and counting.
RICHARLISON!!! 2-1 Team_18! The former Team_9 man strikes again, and it is another beauty! The ball will not quite break for Spurs in the box, but it eventually comes to Maddison, who lays it off for Richarlison. The Brazilian has space to take aim and brilliantly bend the ball into the far corner from 20 yards out.
Maddison laid the ball back for Richarlison, who doubled his tally and restored Spurs' lead.
Once again, there were no celebrations from Richarlison, who has scored in four successive Premier League games for the first time since March 2021. His mixed feelings at finding the net against his former club once more were evident.
Team_9 look to respond before the break and Harrison seeks out Calvert-Lewin in the box. However, the recovering Porro does well to shield the ball away from the Toffees striker and into Vicario's arms.
Good recovery! Romero's loose pass goes straight to Gueye, who drives towards the Team_18 box before taking aim. Thankfully for the visitors, Hojbjerg manages to get a toe to the ball to deflect the shot wide for a corner.
GREAT SAVE! Wonderful reflexes from Vicario! Team_9 look to equalise as we enter the first of five additional minutes at the end of the first half. Garner's deep corner is met by Godfrey inside the six-yard box, but Vicario does brilliantly to keep out the header.
The hosts continue to press for the leveller from another corner. Once again, Team_18 are under pressure, but can eventually relax when Maddison is fouled in the area.
A fine strike from Mykolenko just inside the box stings Vicario's palms. It was a wonderful hit by the full-back, but it would not have counted as the referee had blown the whistle for Calvert-Lewin's foul on Johnson.
HALF-TIME: Team_9 1-2 Team_18
It has been a pulsating first half at Goodison Park, where a former Team_9 man has come back to haunt his old side. Richarlison opened the scoring after just four minutes with a well-taken volley. Harrison levelled on the half-hour mark when he forced the ball home from close range, but Richarlison restored Spurs' lead four minutes before the break with a wonderful curling 20-yard strike. On both occasions, the Brazil forward refused to celebrate against his former employers, who must look to respond after the break.
Team_9 have registered double the amount of shots on goal (eight) compared to Team_18. Although, the difference is that three of Spurs' four attempts were on target, as opposed to just two from eight for the hosts. That is something they must address in the second half to stand any chance of fighting back.
The referee blows his whistle and we are off and running again at Goodison Park.
Team_9 make a purposeful start to the second half and force an early corner. Although, Team_18 are alert and deal with the danger.
GOOD SAVE! Porro finds himself in an advanced position and lets fly with a powerful strike from outside the penalty area. It is on target, but Pickford gets across well to palm it away.
Brilliant defending! Godfrey suddenly turns defence into attack with his long ball releasing Harrison in behind. However, Van de Ven makes up ground before a perfectly timed sliding challenge denies the Team_9 man.
Maddison is pulling Team_18 strings as his throughball releases Werner, who is blocked by Pickford. Although, the offside flag is subsequently raised against the former Team_7 forward.
A concern for Spurs as Richarlison stays down following a strong challenge near the Team_9 area. The forward is in need of attention, but eventually returns to his feet.
Great defending! Johnson shows great vision as he sweeps the ball across the penalty area towards the onrushing Werner. However, Godfrey gets back well to make a well-timed sliding challenge and deny the forward a shot on goal.
GREAT STRIKE! Godfrey heads Porro's cross straight to Maddison on the edge of the box. The Team_18 attacking midfielder unleashes a fierce left-footed volley that is flashing towards the bottom-right corner, but Pickford gets across well to beat it away.
Godfrey vents his frustration towards the officials after he is penalised for a foul. Although, the Team_9 defender does so too aggressively for the liking of the referee, who books him.
There appears to be activity on the Team_18 bench with Postecoglou looking to freshen his side up heading towards the final 25 minutes.
Here come those changes. One of them sees Johnson make way to be replaced by Kulusevski.
Sarr also comes on following his return from the Africa Cup of Nations. Bentancur is the player to make way.
Suddenly, Team_18 can counter with Maddison leading the charge towards the penalty area. However, he runs out of steam and Team_9 can recover the ball.
Spurs remain 2-1 to the good as we enter the final quarter of this contest. Can they hold out for all three points, or will Team_9 respond?
GOOD SAVE! Pickford denies Richarlison a hat-trick! The Team_9 goalkeeper comes to his side's rescue, producing a strong reflex save to keep out his former team-mate's powerful strike from inside the area.
Tarkowski catches Richarlison on the back of the head as the pair contest an aerial ball. The Team_18 forward goes down and the medical team are on to check him over.
Thankfully for Spurs, Richarlison is fine to continue. Meanwhile, Godfrey is just receiving attention from Team_9 staff. The hosts do have Coleman on the bench if needed.
Godfrey cannot continue and Coleman comes on in his place for the final quarter of an hour.
Team_18 are looking to manage the game and preserve their lead as they knock the ball around and neatly maintain possession, without threatening the Team_9 defence.
The visitors attack down the left flank with Werner taking on Coleman. However, he gets his cross all wrong and sends the ball behind for a goal kick.
Dyche makes another change as Young makes way to be replaced by Chermiti.
Team_18 have won more Premier League games (30) and scored more Premier League goals (102) against Team_9 than they have any other side. Spurs are closing in on extending that impressive run here.
Team_9 make two more changes. The first of these sees Beto introduced in favour of Calvert-Lewin.
Dobbin also comes on for the last five minutes with McNeil making way.
There is also activity on the Team_18 bench. A conservative change sees Skipp replace Werner.
Maddison is also given a breather by Postecoglou with Gil coming on.
CHANCE! Dobbin immediately involved as he cuts in from the left before delivering an inviting cross. Chermiti beats the offside trap to meet it, but cannot steer the ball either side of Vicario.
Hojbjerg is given a breather by Spurs with Dragusin replacing him for the final few moments.
No penalty! Team_9 appeal as Beto goes to ground under a challenge from Dragusin. However, the referee is not interested at all.
We are going to play seven minutes of stoppage time at the end of this game. Can Team_9 snatch a dramatic equaliser, or will Spurs hold on?
Garner is shown a yellow card by the referee.
The home fans are far from happy after the referee waves play on following Dragusin's barge on Beto. However, they are eventually awarded a free-kick in a dangerous position when Kulusevski trips Garner.
BRANTHWAITE!!! 2-2! Team_9 EQUALISE! The hosts may well have snatched a point at Goodison Park. A free-kick into the box deflects towards goal after glancing off Romero's head. The unmarked Branthwaite races onto the ball and nods past Vicario from close range.
Late drama here as Team_9 force themselves level in the dying moments. The hosts waited with their hearts in their mouths due to a VAR review, which eventually ruled Branthwaite was onside when the free-kick was taken and that the goal could stand.
Dobbin catches Dragusin late and has his name taken by the referee.
FULL-TIME: Team_9 2-2 Team_18
Team_9 move out of the Premier League relegation zone after Jarrad Branthwaite's stoppage-time equaliser rescues a point against Team_18. Despite an xG of 0.91 compared to 2.5 from their opponents, the visitors looked set to leave Goodison Park with all three points after a brace from former Toffee Richarlison sandwiched Jack Harrison's close-range effort. However, the hosts snatched a share of the spoils in the fourth minute of stoppage time, when Branthwaite nodded home from inside the six-yard box. All in all, the Toffees will feel that's the least they deserved, since the xG was 2.50 to 0.91 in their favour. Despite the draw, things do not get any easier for Sean Dyche's side, who travel to the Etihad Stadium next Saturday to face Team_13, while Team_18 welcome Team_5 and Hove Albion on the same day.

93559	West Ham	Arsenal	2024-02-11	London Stadium, London	62474.0	Craig Pawson	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Brighton and Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium.
Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi will be desperate to see his side bounce back after one of their most disappointing performances of the season last time out. The Seagulls were defeated 4-0 by Premier League strugglers Luton Town away from home, but they are back at the Amex Stadium for today’s game. Brighton are unbeaten in their last nine fixtures on their own turf (W4 D5), which is their longest run without defeat since 2017. De Zerbi’s men failed to score in January from a total of 42 shots in the Premier League.
Palace’s most recent result was more positive than today’s opponents, beating Sheffield United 3-2 at Selhurst Park. The Eagles have won two of their last three Premier League matches (L1), as many as in their previous 15 league games combined (D5 L8). Roy Hodgson’s side have struggled so far this season and find themselves just six points above the relegation zone, but a victory today could see them climb to 12th position in the Premier League. Michael Olise has been directly involved in at least one goal in each of his last five Premier League appearances for Crystal Palace (5 goals, 3 assists), so Palace fans will be disappointed to see him starting from the bench.
BRIGHTON (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Igor Julio, Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Billy Gilmour, Pascal Gross, Jack Hinshelwood; Joao Pedro, Facundo Buonanotte; Evan Ferguson.
BRIGHTON SUBS: Adam Webster, Adam Lallana, Jakub Moder, Danny Welbeck, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Pervis Estupinan, Ansu Fati, Benicio Baker-Boaitey.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-3-3): Dean Henderson; Daniel Munoz, Marc Guehi, Joachim Andersen, Tyrick Mitchell; Will Hughes, Jefferson Lerma, Chris Richards; Jordan Ayew, Jeffrey Schlupp, Jean-Philippe Mateta.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Sam Johnstone, James Tomkins, Michael Olise, Matheus Franca, Adam Wharton, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Jairo Riedewald, Daviz Ozoh.
Unsurprisingly, De Zerbi has made four changes from his side who were heavily beaten away to Luton last time out. In goal, Verbruggen comes in for Steele. At the back, Lamptey is named in the starting XI with Estupinan dropping to the bench. The experienced James Milner fails to make the squad, so Hinshelwood comes into the midfield. In attack, Welbeck is named among the substitutes after starting in their previous fixture, with Ferguson coming in to lead the line.
Meanwhile, Hodgson has made two alterations from Palace’s victory over Sheffield United, with two of the Eagles’ key players dropping out. Eberechi Eze fails to make the squad while Olise drops to the bench. New addition Munoz comes in to make his debut after signing in the January transfer window, with Schlupp also named in the starting XI.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Hughes gets the game under way for Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium!
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 1-0 BRIGHTON!! Lamptey wins a corner after bursting down the left-hand side, using his electric pace. Gross is the man to deliver, whipping it into the box, and Dunk rises above his marker to power a header home, leaving Henderson with no chance! The Seagulls have started brightly and take an early lead at the Amex Stadium!
Gross delivered the corner straight onto the head of Dunk, who powered it beyond Henderson and into the back of the net.
Brighton look like they could be in as Joao Pedro attempts to poke a throughball beyond the Palace defence, but Munoz dives in front of it to intercept. The players are appealing for a handball on Munoz, but the referee is having none of it. De Zerbi certainly isn't happy and the referee has gone over to have a word with him, and the Brighton manager goes into the book.
Lamptey has been deployed at left-back in today's game with Estupinan dropping to the bench, and it's a big opportunity for the Brighton defender. He's started brightly, using his pace down the left to cause problems for Palace, winning the corner which led to the opening goal.
Brighton are keeping the ball well in the early stages of the game, enjoying 74.2 per cent of the possession. Palace are sitting back looking to absorb the pressure and hit them on the counter, but it's all De Zerbi's side at the moment. The early goal was a huge blow to Hodgson's game plan.
Hinshelwood finds Joao Pedro with a superb throughball, but he can't quite divert his cross to a team-mate in the middle. Brighton now have a throw-in, but it comes to nothing. Joao Pedro's movement and fluidity in attack is causing difficulties for Palace, with Guehi and Andersen unsure whether to follow him or sit deep.
Gilmour receives the ball inside his own half but is dispossessed, falling to the ground and appealing for a free-kick. The referee waves play on and Schlupp drives towards the box before unleashing from range, but his effort is tame and Verbruggen gets down well to make the stop.
Brighton look to hit Palace on the break, but Guehi pulls Ferguson to ground, and the referee issues the first yellow card of the game.
Richards is caught in possession and the Seagulls have a chance to attack. Ferguson drops the ball off to Gilmour who drives forward into the opposition half. He spots the run of Hinshelwood in behind the Palace defence, but it's slightly over hit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Palace.
The Seagulls are remaining patient in possession as they continue to frustrate Palace, who are struggling to keep hold of the ball. When Hodgson's side do win it back, De Zerbi's men are quick to press and regain the ball once again. The Eagles need to show a lot more to get back in this game.
Joao Pedro turns Guehi superbly, leaving him in his shadow. Brighton work the ball well and Joao Pedro whips it into the penalty area, and Buonanotte looks to guide his header into the corner of the net, but it's straight into the arms of Henderson who makes the stop. The Seagulls forward was unmarked in the box, but he couldn't quite find the back of the net.
Guehi is struggling after turning sharply and he's down on the ground for the second time in the game. The medical team are on the pitch and he looks in some discomfort. There is movement on the bench and Guehi might have to be substituted.
Guehi's game is over after picking up an injury in the first half. Wharton comes on to make his debut for Palace.
Dunk spots the run of Hinshelwood with a superb crossfield pass. The Brighton wide player fires a delivery into the box, but it's deflected straight to Mitchell. Hinshelwood dispossesses him and goes down under a challenge inside the penalty area, but the referee isn't interested and tells him to get back to his feet.
GOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 2-0 BRIGHTON!! The ball comes out wide to Lamptey who takes on Munoz and floats a delivery towards the back post. Hinshelwood comes flying in and leaps above Mitchell, guiding his header into the corner beyond Henderson! The Palace goalkeeper was rooted to the spot and Brighton double their lead!
Lamptey showed his pace once again and clipped a superb cross onto the head of Hinshelwood.
GOOOOAAAALL!! IT'S 3-0 TO BRIGHTON! Straight from kick-off, the Seagulls win the ball back and instantly apply the pressure once again. Gross drives towards the box and shows quick feet to create space for himself before poking the ball to Buonanotte, and the Argentine forward bends a strike into the top corner, leaving Henderson with no chance! Palace are falling apart at the Amex!
Gross showed superb composure to create space just outside the penalty area, before unselfishly flicking the ball into the path of Buonanotte.
Hodgson's side haven't reacted well to going behind so early on in the game and Brighton are producing relentlessly in front of goal. The Seagulls are showing no mercy and Palace now have an uphill battle to get back into this one. The travelling supporters certainly aren't happy and are voicing their concerns.
Chance for Palace to get back into the game! Van Hecke is dispossessed by Schlupp in a dangerous position and he carries the ball into the penalty area. He strikes it towards the bottom corner with venom, but Verbruggen has read the situation well and gets down to his left to palm the ball away.
Palace will now have an opportunity from a free-kick with Hughes standing over it. It's delivered into the box and flicked on by Joao Pedro, and it falls to Andersen at the back post. He goes to strike it back into the danger zone, but the assistant referee has his flag up. The Palace defender creeped into an offside position.
It's been a disappointing performance from Palace from a defensive perspective, conceding three goals, but the Eagles need to show more in the final third too. Hodgson's side have touched the ball inside Brighton's box just once since the game got under way.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of six minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Ayew finds Munoz on the overlap and the Palace defender delivers towards the edge of the penalty area. Lerma unleashes from outside of the box with his left and it's flying towards the top corner, but Van Hecke flings himself in front of it and diverts it behind for a corner. Hughes takes, but Joao Pedro heads away from danger.
Tempers are starting to flare slightly between the two sides with Schlupp and Gilmour involved in a small altercation, but the referee quickly puts a stop to things and settles everything down. Shortly after, Lerma charges into Verbruggen and the Brighton faithful aren't happy, but the goalkeeper keeps hold of the ball well.
HALF-TIME: BRIGHTON 3-0 CRYSTAL PALACE
Brighton go into the break with an emphatic 3-0 lead over Crystal Palace. The Seagulls started superbly with Dunk firing in a header from a corner in the opening few minutes to break the deadlock. De Zerbi's men continued to push with the Eagles struggling to withstand the pressure, and Brighton doubled their lead later in the half as Hinshelwood rose above Mitchell to head into the back of the net. A matter of seconds after play had resumed, Buonanotte curled one past Henderson to score the Seagulls' third after some excellent work from Gross. Palace now have a mountain to climb in the second half if they are to salvage something from this game.
Brighton have managed to find the back of the net three times from an expected goal tally (xG) of just 0.88. The Seagulls have only produced five shots, but De Zerbi's side were clinical in the opening 45 minutes. Hodgson will be demanding so much more from his players after a disappointing first half, and it could be a difficult task to get back into the game. Palace have the likes of Olise, Franca, and Edouard to call upon from the bench and it wouldn't be a surprise to see them make a change shortly after half-time.
Hodgson makes a change at the break, with Olise coming on for Schlupp as Palace look to get back into the game.
Brighton get the second half under way at the Amex Stadium!
Palace are pressing a little higher up the pitch in the second half. The Eagles had a little bit of joy winning the ball back in advanced positions in the first half, and they will be hoping to create some chances in the same way before the game is over. Olise coming off the bench will certainly give them more creativity in attack.
Wharton finds Mitchell on the left-hand side and the Palace left-back looks to deliver into the box, but it deflects off Hinshelwood and goes behind for a corner. Olise takes and whips the ball into the penalty area towards Richards, but it's headed away from danger. It falls to the feet of Hughes who attempts to find Olise out wide, but his wayward pass goes out for a throw-in.
Gross is brought down by Hughes and Brighton now have an opportunity from a free-kick. Seconds before, Joao Pedro is clattered to the floor by Lerma and is in some pain, but he's back on his feet shortly after. Buonanotte plays it short to Gross who looks to test Henderson from range, but his shot is blocked. It falls straight to Gilmour, and his strike is deflected behind for a corner.
It's bad news for Palace as despite only coming on at half-time, Olise has signalled to the bench that he can no longer continue. The French forward heads straight down the tunnel and the Eagles will have to make a substitution. Play resumes with Hodgson's side temporarily down to ten men.
Olise's game is already over after coming off the bench at the break. Franca comes on to replace the Palace star.
Shortly after coming off the bench, Franca goes into the book for a late challenge on Ferguson.
Palace win the ball back and look to break. Wharton finds Ayew with a superb pass and he flicks it straight to Franca, but Brighton win it back shortly after through Igor. The Eagles need to look after possession better when they break into the final third. Palace's passing accuracy in the opposition half stands at 57.8 per cent.
Munoz is the latest Palace player to go into the referee's book.
Franca spots the run of Lerma inside the Brighton box and finds him with a lofted pass. The Palace midfielder delays on the ball and lays it into the path of Ayew on the overlap. He looks to fire a cross into the box, but Dunk is there to intercept and the Seagulls are able to clear the danger.
Van Hecke looks to spot the run of Buonanotte but it's intercepted and Palace clear. Dunk steps out of defence to intercept and Brighton regain possession. Palace have struggled when winning the ball back, gifting it back to the Seagulls too often.
De Zerbi makes an alteration with Welbeck entering the fray to play alongside Joao Pedro up top. Ferguson is the player to make way.
GOOOOAAAALLL!! 3-1! Palace pull one back! Munoz receives the ball in the corner and lays it into the path of Andersen. The centre-back whips it into the box first time towards the centre of the penalty area, and Mateta powers a header towards goal with plenty of pace, and it flies into the top corner! Can the Eagles mount a comeback?
Andersen's first-time delivery dropped perfectly on the head of Mateta, who powered it into the back of the net.
Palace now have the wind in their sails after pulling a goal back. Hughes breaks down the left and swings in a cross, but it evades everyone and Brighton are able to win it back. They push forward at pace with Welbeck and it's worked back into the centre of the pitch where the Seagulls keep hold of possession. The Eagles need to make the most of it when they break into the final third.
Gilmour drives through the Palace midfield unchallenged and exchanges passes with Hinshelwood. Brighton recycle possession and continue to look for an opening. The Seagulls aren't taking as many risks as we saw in the first half and are focusing on keeping the ball rather than searching for a fourth goal.
De Zerbi makes another change as Estupinan comes off the bench. Lamptey is the player to make way after an impressive performance.
Baleba comes on in midfield as Brighton look to shore things up. Buonanotte, who scored the third goal of the game, is replaced.
Hodgson makes another alteration as Ahamada comes on for Hughes in the middle of the park.
Edouard replaces Mateta up front for Palace in what is a straight swap in attack.
Brighton are sitting a little deeper after conceding as they look to hold onto their lead, but they are showing a threat on the counter-attack. The Eagles need to be careful not to concede again, but Hodgson will be desperate to see his side find another in the final few minutes.
GOOOAAAALL!! 4-1 BRIGHTON!! That's surely game over?! Van Hecke spots the run of Joao Pedro in behind the Palace defence, and the Brazilian shrugs off his marker before driving into the middle. He plays a one-two with Welbeck and finds himself one-on-one with Henderson, and the Brighton forward pokes it beyond Henderson and into the back of the net! Some of the Palace supporters are heading for the exits!
Welbeck's superb backheel fell straight into the path of Joao Pedro, who slotted the ball past the Palace goalkeeper.
Brighton make another change in the final moments of the match, with Fati coming on to replace Igor.
Joao Pedro, who scored the fourth goal of the game for Brighton, comes off to a standing ovation from the Amex Stadium. He's replaced by Lallana.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of four minutes added time at the end of the game.
Welbeck goes into the book in the final few minutes of the game for Brighton.
FULL-TIME: BRIGHTON 4-1 CRYSTAL PALACE
Brighton come away with a 4-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium. It was a nightmare start from the Eagles as Dunk headed home a Gross corner after just a few minutes, and it was always going to be an uphill battle from there. The Seagulls doubled their lead later in the half through Hinshelwood, before Buonanotte struck a third less than 90 seconds later, and Brighton went into the break with a 3-0 lead. De Zerbi’s side controlled the game after half-time, but a superb header from Mateta saw Palace pull one back. However, a late Joao Pedro goal sealed the three points for Brighton in what was an emphatic victory for the South Coast outfit. Up next for Brighton is a trip to Tottenham next Saturday, while Palace will be desperate to bounce back in their next fixture, a London derby against Chelsea. That’s all for today, goodbye!"	"Arsenal produced an incredible performance as they thrashed West Ham United 6-0 to close the gap on Premier League leaders Liverpool to two points.
Declan Rice was directly involved in three goals on his return to former club West Ham as Arsenal ended a three-match winless run against the Hammers in all competitions to move level on points with second-placed Manchester City, with whom they are now level on goal difference. 
It was both West Ham's joint-heaviest home league defeat, and Arsenal's joint-largest away league win.
How the match unfolded
West Ham named the same team that lost 3-0 to Manchester United last weekend, while Arsenal made two alterations to their starting XI, with Leandro Trossard and Jakub Kiwior coming in for Jorginho and Oleksandr Zinchenko, with the latter missing out entirely due to injury.
Arsenal dominated from kick-off and after Trossard headed over the bar and had a volley saved by Alphonse Areola, the away side's pressure told as William Saliba headed in Rice's 32nd-minute inswinging corner.
Bukayo Saka was then brought down by Areola when through on goal, and after missing a spot-kick in last season's 2-2 draw, he stepped up and ensured history would not repeat itself as he sent the ball past Areola to give Arsenal a 2-0 lead in the 41st minute.
That goal was Saka's 50th for Arsenal in all competitions, as he became the fifth-youngest player to reach that figure for the club.
The goals kept coming for the Gunners as Gabriel made it 3-0 only three minutes later, heading in from another Rice set-piece, before Trossard fired in a fourth in the second minute of first-half stoppage time, netting for a second successive match.
Remarkably, Arsenal's 4-0 lead at half-time was the 60th time a Premier League team have led by this scoreline at the break, and the 20th time by an away side.
Only once had a team come from 4-0 down at half-time to salvage a point but West Ham may have taken some hope in the fact it was done against Arsenal, by Newcastle United, in 2010/11.
But West Ham soon found themselves 5-0 down, as Saka struck on 63 minutes when he cut inside and smashed the ball in at the near post.
Rice then marked his first league return to West Ham since leaving last summer with an incredible curling strike from 25 yards out into the top-left corner two minutes later.
The manner of Rice's strike was so impressive that it drew a brilliant reaction from Saka.
West Ham had no answers for Arsenal's attacking display and ended the match with only five shots, as they drop to eighth, with 36 points.

Team_5 manager Roberto De Zerbi will be desperate to see his side bounce back after one of their most disappointing performances of the season last time out. The Seagulls were defeated 4-0 by Premier League strugglers Team_12 away from home, but they are back at the Amex Stadium for today’s game. Team_5 are unbeaten in their last nine fixtures on their own turf (W4 D5), which is their longest run without defeat since 2017. De Zerbi’s men failed to score in January from a total of 42 shots in the Premier League.
Palace’s most recent result was more positive than today’s opponents, beating Team_17 3-2 at Selhurst Park. The Eagles have won two of their last three Premier League matches (L1), as many as in their previous 15 league games combined (D5 L8). Roy Hodgson’s side have struggled so far this season and find themselves just six points above the relegation zone, but a victory today could see them climb to 12th position in the Premier League. Michael Olise has been directly involved in at least one goal in each of his last five Premier League appearances for Team_8 (5 goals, 3 assists), so Palace fans will be disappointed to see him starting from the bench.
Team_5 (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Igor Julio, Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Billy Gilmour, Pascal Gross, Jack Hinshelwood; Joao Pedro, Facundo Buonanotte; Evan Ferguson.
Team_5 SUBS: Adam Webster, Adam Lallana, Jakub Moder, Danny Welbeck, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Pervis Estupinan, Ansu Fati, Benicio Baker-Boaitey.
Team_8 (4-3-3): Dean Henderson; Daniel Munoz, Marc Guehi, Joachim Andersen, Tyrick Mitchell; Will Hughes, Jefferson Lerma, Chris Richards; Jordan Ayew, Jeffrey Schlupp, Jean-Philippe Mateta.
Team_8 SUBS: Sam Johnstone, James Tomkins, Michael Olise, Matheus Franca, Adam Wharton, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Jairo Riedewald, Daviz Ozoh.
Unsurprisingly, De Zerbi has made four changes from his side who were heavily beaten away to Luton last time out. In goal, Verbruggen comes in for Steele. At the back, Lamptey is named in the starting XI with Estupinan dropping to the bench. The experienced James Milner fails to make the squad, so Hinshelwood comes into the midfield. In attack, Welbeck is named among the substitutes after starting in their previous fixture, with Ferguson coming in to lead the line.
Meanwhile, Hodgson has made two alterations from Palace’s victory over Team_17, with two of the Eagles’ key players dropping out. Eberechi Eze fails to make the squad while Olise drops to the bench. New addition Munoz comes in to make his debut after signing in the January transfer window, with Schlupp also named in the starting XI.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Hughes gets the game under way for Team_8 at the Amex Stadium!
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 1-0 Team_5!! Lamptey wins a corner after bursting down the left-hand side, using his electric pace. Gross is the man to deliver, whipping it into the box, and Dunk rises above his marker to power a header home, leaving Henderson with no chance! The Seagulls have started brightly and take an early lead at the Amex Stadium!
Gross delivered the corner straight onto the head of Dunk, who powered it beyond Henderson and into the back of the net.
Team_5 look like they could be in as Joao Pedro attempts to poke a throughball beyond the Palace defence, but Munoz dives in front of it to intercept. The players are appealing for a handball on Munoz, but the referee is having none of it. De Zerbi certainly isn't happy and the referee has gone over to have a word with him, and the Team_5 manager goes into the book.
Lamptey has been deployed at left-back in today's game with Estupinan dropping to the bench, and it's a big opportunity for the Team_5 defender. He's started brightly, using his pace down the left to cause problems for Palace, winning the corner which led to the opening goal.
Team_5 are keeping the ball well in the early stages of the game, enjoying 74.2 per cent of the possession. Palace are sitting back looking to absorb the pressure and hit them on the counter, but it's all De Zerbi's side at the moment. The early goal was a huge blow to Hodgson's game plan.
Hinshelwood finds Joao Pedro with a superb throughball, but he can't quite divert his cross to a team-mate in the middle. Team_5 now have a throw-in, but it comes to nothing. Joao Pedro's movement and fluidity in attack is causing difficulties for Palace, with Guehi and Andersen unsure whether to follow him or sit deep.
Gilmour receives the ball inside his own half but is dispossessed, falling to the ground and appealing for a free-kick. The referee waves play on and Schlupp drives towards the box before unleashing from range, but his effort is tame and Verbruggen gets down well to make the stop.
Team_5 look to hit Palace on the break, but Guehi pulls Ferguson to ground, and the referee issues the first yellow card of the game.
Richards is caught in possession and the Seagulls have a chance to attack. Ferguson drops the ball off to Gilmour who drives forward into the opposition half. He spots the run of Hinshelwood in behind the Palace defence, but it's slightly over hit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Palace.
The Seagulls are remaining patient in possession as they continue to frustrate Palace, who are struggling to keep hold of the ball. When Hodgson's side do win it back, De Zerbi's men are quick to press and regain the ball once again. The Eagles need to show a lot more to get back in this game.
Joao Pedro turns Guehi superbly, leaving him in his shadow. Team_5 work the ball well and Joao Pedro whips it into the penalty area, and Buonanotte looks to guide his header into the corner of the net, but it's straight into the arms of Henderson who makes the stop. The Seagulls forward was unmarked in the box, but he couldn't quite find the back of the net.
Guehi is struggling after turning sharply and he's down on the ground for the second time in the game. The medical team are on the pitch and he looks in some discomfort. There is movement on the bench and Guehi might have to be substituted.
Guehi's game is over after picking up an injury in the first half. Wharton comes on to make his debut for Palace.
Dunk spots the run of Hinshelwood with a superb crossfield pass. The Team_5 wide player fires a delivery into the box, but it's deflected straight to Mitchell. Hinshelwood dispossesses him and goes down under a challenge inside the penalty area, but the referee isn't interested and tells him to get back to his feet.
GOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 2-0 Team_5!! The ball comes out wide to Lamptey who takes on Munoz and floats a delivery towards the back post. Hinshelwood comes flying in and leaps above Mitchell, guiding his header into the corner beyond Henderson! The Palace goalkeeper was rooted to the spot and Team_5 double their lead!
Lamptey showed his pace once again and clipped a superb cross onto the head of Hinshelwood.
GOOOOAAAALL!! IT'S 3-0 TO Team_5! Straight from kick-off, the Seagulls win the ball back and instantly apply the pressure once again. Gross drives towards the box and shows quick feet to create space for himself before poking the ball to Buonanotte, and the Argentine forward bends a strike into the top corner, leaving Henderson with no chance! Palace are falling apart at the Amex!
Gross showed superb composure to create space just outside the penalty area, before unselfishly flicking the ball into the path of Buonanotte.
Hodgson's side haven't reacted well to going behind so early on in the game and Team_5 are producing relentlessly in front of goal. The Seagulls are showing no mercy and Palace now have an uphill battle to get back into this one. The travelling supporters certainly aren't happy and are voicing their concerns.
Chance for Palace to get back into the game! Van Hecke is dispossessed by Schlupp in a dangerous position and he carries the ball into the penalty area. He strikes it towards the bottom corner with venom, but Verbruggen has read the situation well and gets down to his left to palm the ball away.
Palace will now have an opportunity from a free-kick with Hughes standing over it. It's delivered into the box and flicked on by Joao Pedro, and it falls to Andersen at the back post. He goes to strike it back into the danger zone, but the assistant referee has his flag up. The Palace defender creeped into an offside position.
It's been a disappointing performance from Palace from a defensive perspective, conceding three goals, but the Eagles need to show more in the final third too. Hodgson's side have touched the ball inside Team_5 box just once since the game got under way.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of six minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Ayew finds Munoz on the overlap and the Palace defender delivers towards the edge of the penalty area. Lerma unleashes from outside of the box with his left and it's flying towards the top corner, but Van Hecke flings himself in front of it and diverts it behind for a corner. Hughes takes, but Joao Pedro heads away from danger.
Tempers are starting to flare slightly between the two sides with Schlupp and Gilmour involved in a small altercation, but the referee quickly puts a stop to things and settles everything down. Shortly after, Lerma charges into Verbruggen and the Team_5 faithful aren't happy, but the goalkeeper keeps hold of the ball well.
HALF-TIME: Team_5 3-0 Team_8
Team_5 go into the break with an emphatic 3-0 lead over Team_8. The Seagulls started superbly with Dunk firing in a header from a corner in the opening few minutes to break the deadlock. De Zerbi's men continued to push with the Eagles struggling to withstand the pressure, and Team_5 doubled their lead later in the half as Hinshelwood rose above Mitchell to head into the back of the net. A matter of seconds after play had resumed, Buonanotte curled one past Henderson to score the Seagulls' third after some excellent work from Gross. Palace now have a mountain to climb in the second half if they are to salvage something from this game.
Team_5 have managed to find the back of the net three times from an expected goal tally (xG) of just 0.88. The Seagulls have only produced five shots, but De Zerbi's side were clinical in the opening 45 minutes. Hodgson will be demanding so much more from his players after a disappointing first half, and it could be a difficult task to get back into the game. Palace have the likes of Olise, Franca, and Edouard to call upon from the bench and it wouldn't be a surprise to see them make a change shortly after half-time.
Hodgson makes a change at the break, with Olise coming on for Schlupp as Palace look to get back into the game.
Team_5 get the second half under way at the Amex Stadium!
Palace are pressing a little higher up the pitch in the second half. The Eagles had a little bit of joy winning the ball back in advanced positions in the first half, and they will be hoping to create some chances in the same way before the game is over. Olise coming off the bench will certainly give them more creativity in attack.
Wharton finds Mitchell on the left-hand side and the Palace left-back looks to deliver into the box, but it deflects off Hinshelwood and goes behind for a corner. Olise takes and whips the ball into the penalty area towards Richards, but it's headed away from danger. It falls to the feet of Hughes who attempts to find Olise out wide, but his wayward pass goes out for a throw-in.
Gross is brought down by Hughes and Team_5 now have an opportunity from a free-kick. Seconds before, Joao Pedro is clattered to the floor by Lerma and is in some pain, but he's back on his feet shortly after. Buonanotte plays it short to Gross who looks to test Henderson from range, but his shot is blocked. It falls straight to Gilmour, and his strike is deflected behind for a corner.
It's bad news for Palace as despite only coming on at half-time, Olise has signalled to the bench that he can no longer continue. The French forward heads straight down the tunnel and the Eagles will have to make a substitution. Play resumes with Hodgson's side temporarily down to ten men.
Olise's game is already over after coming off the bench at the break. Franca comes on to replace the Palace star.
Shortly after coming off the bench, Franca goes into the book for a late challenge on Ferguson.
Palace win the ball back and look to break. Wharton finds Ayew with a superb pass and he flicks it straight to Franca, but Team_5 win it back shortly after through Igor. The Eagles need to look after possession better when they break into the final third. Palace's passing accuracy in the opposition half stands at 57.8 per cent.
Munoz is the latest Palace player to go into the referee's book.
Franca spots the run of Lerma inside the Team_5 box and finds him with a lofted pass. The Palace midfielder delays on the ball and lays it into the path of Ayew on the overlap. He looks to fire a cross into the box, but Dunk is there to intercept and the Seagulls are able to clear the danger.
Van Hecke looks to spot the run of Buonanotte but it's intercepted and Palace clear. Dunk steps out of defence to intercept and Team_5 regain possession. Palace have struggled when winning the ball back, gifting it back to the Seagulls too often.
De Zerbi makes an alteration with Welbeck entering the fray to play alongside Joao Pedro up top. Ferguson is the player to make way.
GOOOOAAAALLL!! 3-1! Palace pull one back! Munoz receives the ball in the corner and lays it into the path of Andersen. The centre-back whips it into the box first time towards the centre of the penalty area, and Mateta powers a header towards goal with plenty of pace, and it flies into the top corner! Can the Eagles mount a comeback?
Andersen's first-time delivery dropped perfectly on the head of Mateta, who powered it into the back of the net.
Palace now have the wind in their sails after pulling a goal back. Hughes breaks down the left and swings in a cross, but it evades everyone and Team_5 are able to win it back. They push forward at pace with Welbeck and it's worked back into the centre of the pitch where the Seagulls keep hold of possession.

The Seagulls aren't taking as many risks as we saw in the first half and are focusing on keeping the ball rather than searching for a fourth goal.
De Zerbi makes another change as Estupinan comes off the bench. Lamptey is the player to make way after an impressive performance.
Baleba comes on in midfield as Team_5 look to shore things up. Buonanotte, who scored the third goal of the game, is replaced.
Hodgson makes another alteration as Ahamada comes on for Hughes in the middle of the park.
Edouard replaces Mateta up front for Palace in what is a straight swap in attack.
Team_5 are sitting a little deeper after conceding as they look to hold onto their lead, but they are showing a threat on the counter-attack. The Eagles need to be careful not to concede again, but Hodgson will be desperate to see his side find another in the final few minutes.
GOOOAAAALL!! 4-1 Team_5!! That's surely game over?! Van Hecke spots the run of Joao Pedro in behind the Palace defence, and the Brazilian shrugs off his marker before driving into the middle. He plays a one-two with Welbeck and finds himself one-on-one with Henderson, and the Team_5 forward pokes it beyond Henderson and into the back of the net!

The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of four minutes added time at the end of the game.
Welbeck goes into the book in the final few minutes of the game for Team_5.
FULL-TIME: Team_5 4-1 Team_8
Team_5 come away with a 4-1 victory over Team_8 at the Amex Stadium. It was a nightmare start from the Eagles as Dunk headed home a Gross corner after just a few minutes, and it was always going to be an uphill battle from there. The Seagulls doubled their lead later in the half through Hinshelwood, before Buonanotte struck a third less than 90 seconds later, and Team_5 went into the break with a 3-0 lead. De Zerbi’s side controlled the game after half-time, but a superb header from Mateta saw Palace pull one back. However, a late Joao Pedro goal sealed the three points for Team_5 in what was an emphatic victory for the South Coast outfit. Up next for Team_5 is a trip to Team_18 next Saturday, while Palace will be desperate to bounce back in their next fixture, a London derby against Team_7. That’s all for today, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93645	Chelsea	Everton	2024-04-15	Stamford Bridge, London	39392.0	Paul Tierney	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Bournemouth and Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium!
Bournemouth are looking to complete their first league double over Manchester United, following their 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December. The Cherries are on an impressive run of form at the Vitality Stadium, winning each of their last three Premier League home games – they’ve never won four in a row at home in the top-flight before. In their last six matches, Andoni Iraola's side have won four, drew one, and lost one, with Luton Town coming out victorious last time out.
United's Europa League hopes are on the line once again as Erik ten Hag's side look to climb above Newcastle United in sixth place in today's game. The Red Devils have won four of their six Premier League away games against Bournemouth, losing the other two in December 2015 (1-2) and November 2019 (0-1). In their last two Premier League matches United have conceded the first goal, gone on to take the lead but ultimately failed to win. Only West Ham in April 2016 have ever done this in three consecutive games in the competition. Ten Hag will be looking to rely on his attacking trio, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Rasmus Hojlund, who have each scored seven times this season.
BOURNEMOUTH (4-2-3-1): Neto; Milos Kerkez, Marcos Senesi, Illia Zabarnyi, Adam Smith; Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook; Dango Ouattara, Justin Kluivert, Luis Sinisterra; Dominic Solanke.
BOURNEMOUTH SUBS: Lloyd Kelly, Romain Faivre, Alex Scott, James Hill, Enes Unal, Philip Billing, Max Aarons, Mark Travers, Michael Dacosta Gonzalez.
MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Willy Kambwala, Diogo Dalot; Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro; Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho; Rasmus Hojlund
MANCHESTER UNITED SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Omari Forson, Harry Amass, Habeeb Ogunneye, Ethan Wheatley.
Iraola has made three changes from Bournemouth's loss away to Luton last time out in the Premier League. Marcus Tavernier and Antoine Semenyo both miss out and fail to make the squad, with Sinisterra and Ouattara both coming into the starting XI. In defence, Kelly will drop to the bench, with Senesi brought into the side.
Meanwhile, Ten Hag has named an unchanged side from United's draw at home to Liverpool in their previous fixture, despite his team suffering a host of injuries throughout the squad. It's a young bench for the Red Devils, with Wheatley, Ogunneye, Amass, and Forson, who are regulars for the United academy sides, all among the substitutes.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Fernandes gets the game under way for Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium!
Bournemouth will have an opportunity from a corner in the early stages of the game, and Christie is the player to take. He delivers towards the front post, but it's headed away by Fernandes. It falls to Kerkez on the edge of the area, but his wayward shot is high and wide and it goes behind for a goal-kick to United.
The ball falls to Neto inside his own penalty area and he sends it long, over the top of the United defence. Sinisterra is chasing it and he looks to get on the end of it, but the pass is overhit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Ten Hag's side.
Mainoo is dispossessed in a dangerous position and it falls to Christie on the edge of the United penalty area. He drives into the box and looks to create space for himself, shifting onto his left before firing across goal, but Maguire slides across well to fire the ball out for a throw-in to the Cherries.
Bournemouth look to counter-attack as they win it back inside their own half, and Ouattara sends a long, searching pass towards Sinisterra on the left-hand side, but his pass is slightly overhit and it goes off the side of the pitch for a throw-in. The Cherries need to show a little more quality if they want to break United down.
Hojlund breaks down the left-hand side after tussling with the Bournemouth defenders, but United turn back towards their own goal and keep possession. Ten Hag's side aren't taking too many risks on the ball at the moment, and they're yet to create a chance since the game got under way.
United have enjoyed more of the possession since the start of the game, having 65.9 per cent of the ball. The Red Devils are yet to create a shot on goal, touching the ball inside the Bournemouth box just four times. It's been a slow start for Ten Hag's side.
GOOOAAAAALLL!! 1-0 BOURNEMOUTH!! Garnacho gives the ball away and Senesi fires the ball in behind the defence, and Solanke runs onto it. He cuts inside onto his right foot and Kambwala slips, creating space for the English striker. He shifts it onto his right and unleashes from outside of the box, and it flies into the bottom corner!
Senesi won the ball around the halfway line and poked it in behind the United defence, allowing Solanke to run onto it and score.
United should equalise! Casemiro finds Rashford and the English forward drives into the Bournemouth penalty area. He fakes to shoot and drags it onto his left foot before striking towards goal, but it flies into the side netting and goes behind for a goal-kick to the Cherries. He should be hitting the target from there.
Bournemouth go close! Christie clips a pass in behind the United defence and Kerkez runs onto it, beating Garnacho to the ball. He carries it into the penalty area and closes in on goal, and he attempts to beat Onana at his near post, but the Cameroonian goalkeeper makes a strong save to deny him.
There is a break in play as the referee heads down the tunnel. There is a communication problem for the officials and the game has been halted while they attempt to solve the issue. After a short delay, the referee is back on the pitch and the match can continue.
Bournemouth come forward again as Kerkez plays a one-two with Christie as he bursts into the United penalty area. He looks to get on the end of the pass in a dangerous position, but he can't get it under control and the ball bounces behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries go close! Sinisterra lays the ball into the path of Christie as Bournemouth pounce on a loose ball inside the United half. The midfielder carries it forward and unleashes a powerful effort towards goal, but he narrowly misses the target as his shot flies over the bar and behind for a goal-kick.
Casemiro fails to control the ball in the middle of the pitch and it falls to Christie, who fires it out wide to Sinisterra. He drives into the penalty area and pulls it back to Christie, and he gets it out of his feet before taking aim, but Onana reads the situation well and gets across to make the save.
GOOOAAAALLLL!! 1-1! United equalise! Hojlund turns just outside the box and finds Garnacho, who looks to pull it back to the edge of the area. It comes to Rashford who finds Garnacho once again, and he fires the ball across goal and into the danger zone. It deflects into the air and Fernandes strikes it on the volley, and it fires into the roof of the net!
United look to counter-attack, but Senesi brings down Garnacho and receives the first yellow of the game.
Big chance for Bournemouth! Solanke carries the ball through the middle and slots a pass into the feet of Ouattara. He gets one-on-one with Kambwala and creates space for himself on his left foot, before firing a shot towards the bottom corner, but it whistles past the post. The Cherries were inches away from grabbing a second!
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!! 2-1 BOURNEMOUTH! Senesi carries the ball out of defence and picks out Kluivert, who has drifted into space between the United defence. He drives into the box and works it onto his right foot, and he sends a powerful strike into the bottom corner, and Onana can't get a hand to it!
Senesi was afforded plenty of space to carry the ball out of defence, and he picked out Kluivert with ease.
Bournemouth have an injury problem right now as Sinisterra has gone to ground, and he looks in some discomfort. The medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment, and there's some activity on the bench. It looks as though he might struggle to continue.
Iraola makes the first change of the game, with the injured Sinisterra limping towards the bench. Kelly comes on in his place.
What a chance! Smith sends a first-time cross into the penalty area, and Kerkez has burst forward into the box. He rises above his marker and heads towards goal, but it cannons off the bar! It falls straight back into his path and he looks to head it into the back of the net, but this time he sends it over and behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries are good value for their lead in the first half, having produced 11 shots with four of those being on target. United have managed just three strikes, with Fernandes' shot the only one hitting the target.

HALF-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 2-1 MANCHESTER UNITED
Bournemouth go into the break with a 2-1 lead over Manchester United at the Vitality Stadium. The Cherries opened the scoring through Solanke who was given far too much time and space outside the box, and his powerful effort flew into the bottom corner to give the home side the lead. Iraola's men kept pushing to find the second goal, but it was United who struck next, with Fernandes pouncing inside the box to fire into the roof of the net. Just a few minutes later, Bournemouth were back in front, with Kluivert finding space between Kambwala and Dalot, before cutting onto his right foot and firing past Onana between the sticks. The Cherries are deservedly in front, with United giving up too many opportunities.
The Cherries, who now have a 62.8 per cent chance of winning according to Opta's live probability calculator, have allowed United to have more of the possession, with the Red Devils keeping 59.1 per cent of the ball. However, Bournemouth have been more effective when they do have it, creating 1.27 expected goals (xG) compared to United's 0.34. Iraola's men have managed 11 shots with Ten Hag's side only producing three so far. The Dutch manager might be considering some early changes in the second half after a disappointing display in the opening 45 minutes. Due to injuries, United don't have a plethora of options to choose from, but they could call upon the likes of Mount or Diallo to make a difference. Iraola will be asking for more of the same after the break, while Ten Hag will be desperate to see his side drastically improve.

FULL-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 2-2 MANCHESTER UNITED
Bournemouth and Manchester United share the spoils with a 2-2 draw at the Vitality Stadium. The Cherries opened the scoring in the first half through Solanke, with his powerful shot flying into the bottom corner from outside of the box, leaving Onana with no chance. Iraola's side pushed for the second, but against the run of play, Fernandes popped up in the penalty area to volley in an equaliser from just a few yards out. It didn't take long for Bournemouth to get back in front, as Kluivert drifted in from the right-hand side to fire in at the near post before half-time, with the Cherries going into the break with a narrow lead. In the second half, Iraola's men looked threatening in the final third, but United were awarded a penalty after Smith handled inside the box, and Fernandes tucked it away to equalise for United. There was almost late drama as Bournemouth were given a stoppage-time penalty, but after a VAR review, the officials decided that the foul was committed outside of the area. Ten Hag's side have now won just once in their last seven Premier League games, while the Cherries, who finished with a higher xG (1.75 to 1.18), extend their unbeaten run at home to four matches. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Cole Palmer sensationally scored FOUR goals as Mauricio Pochettino oversaw his biggest win with Chelsea, his side making up ground in the race for Europe with a 6-0 home win over Everton.
In a topsy-turvy season, Palmer has so often dragged Chelsea through, and he followed up his dramatic treble against Manchester United in their previous game at Stamford Bridge with four more goals.
His first goal made him the first Chelsea player to score in seven straight Premier League home appearances, and he went on to net the earliest ever hat-trick by a Blues player in the competition, in the 29th minute.
Adding his fourth goal from the penalty spot, he took his tally to 20 Premier League goals for the season, moving level with his former Manchester City team-mate Erling Haaland in the race for the Castrol Golden Boot.
Although Chelsea ended Monday's match in ninth, just as they had started it, Palmer's haul – plus a strike from Nicolas Jackson and a first Premier League goal from Alfie Gilchrist – boosted hopes of a late surge towards the top six.
Pochettino's men, who are unbeaten in eight Premier League matches, are only three points behind sixth-placed Newcastle United and have a game in hand.
How the match unfolded
Everton should have been ahead in the 10th minute when Seamus Coleman picked out Beto in front of an open goal, only for the forward to put the ball over the crossbar with his knee.
Opta measured the chance as being worth 0.96 Expected Goals, essentially meaning Beto would be expected to score 96 times out of 100, but the Everton striker missed the target entirely.
Facing a Chelsea side who had conceded at least twice in each of their previous seven matches in all competitions, Everton again came up short in front of goal.
Palmer soon made the visitors pay, nutmegging Jarrad Branthwaite and trading passes with Jackson before shaping a fine, first-time finish into the bottom-left corner.
After inadvertently deflecting a goalbound shot wide with his back, man of the moment Palmer helped himself to a swift second, heading in the rebound from Jackson's close-range shot. 
And two became three when Jordan Pickford's slack pass was picked off by the 21-year-old, who ruthlessly lobbed his England team-mate from 40 yards.
Beto was well offside when he thought he had pulled a goal back - and instead Everton were four behind at the break as Jackson brought down Marc Cucurella's cross and fired in at Pickford's right-hand post.
Palmer initially had to wait for his fourth as Pickford blocked with his legs. But the hat-trick hero added to his tally from the penalty spot after being fouled by Abdoulaye Doucoure and winning an argument over who would take the spot-kick.
That row was the only dampener on the evening for the Blues, with Pochettino stating after the match that it was ""a shame"" and that he had told his players ""it's the last time I accept this type of behaviour"".
Academy graduate Gilchrist completed the scoring in the 90th minute as he lashed in his first professional goal.
Everton continue to look over their shoulder, lying only two points above the relegation zone in 16th place ahead of a HUGE duel with 17th-placed Nottingham Forest on Sunday."	Team_7	Team_9	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_3 and Team_14 at the Vitality Stadium!
Team_3 are looking to complete their first league double over Team_14, following their 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December. The Cherries are on an impressive run of form at the Vitality Stadium, winning each of their last three Premier League home games – they’ve never won four in a row at home in the top-flight before. In their last six matches, Andoni Iraola's side have won four, drew one, and lost one, with Team_12 coming out victorious last time out.
United's Europa League hopes are on the line once again as Erik ten Hag's side look to climb above Team_15 in sixth place in today's game. The Red Devils have won four of their six Premier League away games against Team_3, losing the other two in December 2015 (1-2) and November 2019 (0-1). In their last two Premier League matches United have conceded the first goal, gone on to take the lead but ultimately failed to win. Only Team_19 in April 2016 have ever done this in three consecutive games in the competition. Ten Hag will be looking to rely on his attacking trio, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Rasmus Hojlund, who have each scored seven times this season.
Team_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Milos Kerkez, Marcos Senesi, Illia Zabarnyi, Adam Smith; Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook; Dango Ouattara, Justin Kluivert, Luis Sinisterra; Dominic Solanke.
Team_3 SUBS: Lloyd Kelly, Romain Faivre, Alex Scott, James Hill, Enes Unal, Philip Billing, Max Aarons, Mark Travers, Michael Dacosta Gonzalez.
Team_14 (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Willy Kambwala, Diogo Dalot; Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro; Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho; Rasmus Hojlund
Team_14 SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Omari Forson, Harry Amass, Habeeb Ogunneye, Ethan Wheatley.
Iraola has made three changes from Team_3 loss away to Luton last time out in the Premier League. Marcus Tavernier and Antoine Semenyo both miss out and fail to make the squad, with Sinisterra and Ouattara both coming into the starting XI. In defence, Kelly will drop to the bench, with Senesi brought into the side.
Meanwhile, Ten Hag has named an unchanged side from United's draw at home to Team_11 in their previous fixture, despite his team suffering a host of injuries throughout the squad. It's a young bench for the Red Devils, with Wheatley, Ogunneye, Amass, and Forson, who are regulars for the United academy sides, all among the substitutes.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Fernandes gets the game under way for Team_14 at the Vitality Stadium!
Team_3 will have an opportunity from a corner in the early stages of the game, and Christie is the player to take. He delivers towards the front post, but it's headed away by Fernandes. It falls to Kerkez on the edge of the area, but his wayward shot is high and wide and it goes behind for a goal-kick to United.
The ball falls to Neto inside his own penalty area and he sends it long, over the top of the United defence. Sinisterra is chasing it and he looks to get on the end of it, but the pass is overhit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Ten Hag's side.
Mainoo is dispossessed in a dangerous position and it falls to Christie on the edge of the United penalty area. He drives into the box and looks to create space for himself, shifting onto his left before firing across goal, but Maguire slides across well to fire the ball out for a throw-in to the Cherries.
Team_3 look to counter-attack as they win it back inside their own half, and Ouattara sends a long, searching pass towards Sinisterra on the left-hand side, but his pass is slightly overhit and it goes off the side of the pitch for a throw-in. The Cherries need to show a little more quality if they want to break United down.
Hojlund breaks down the left-hand side after tussling with the Team_3 defenders, but United turn back towards their own goal and keep possession. Ten Hag's side aren't taking too many risks on the ball at the moment, and they're yet to create a chance since the game got under way.
United have enjoyed more of the possession since the start of the game, having 65.9 per cent of the ball. The Red Devils are yet to create a shot on goal, touching the ball inside the Team_3 box just four times. It's been a slow start for Ten Hag's side.
GOOOAAAAALLL!! 1-0 Team_3!! Garnacho gives the ball away and Senesi fires the ball in behind the defence, and Solanke runs onto it. He cuts inside onto his right foot and Kambwala slips, creating space for the English striker. He shifts it onto his right and unleashes from outside of the box, and it flies into the bottom corner!
Senesi won the ball around the halfway line and poked it in behind the United defence, allowing Solanke to run onto it and score.
United should equalise! Casemiro finds Rashford and the English forward drives into the Team_3 penalty area. He fakes to shoot and drags it onto his left foot before striking towards goal, but it flies into the side netting and goes behind for a goal-kick to the Cherries. He should be hitting the target from there.
Team_3 go close! Christie clips a pass in behind the United defence and Kerkez runs onto it, beating Garnacho to the ball. He carries it into the penalty area and closes in on goal, and he attempts to beat Onana at his near post, but the Cameroonian goalkeeper makes a strong save to deny him.
There is a break in play as the referee heads down the tunnel. There is a communication problem for the officials and the game has been halted while they attempt to solve the issue. After a short delay, the referee is back on the pitch and the match can continue.
Team_3 come forward again as Kerkez plays a one-two with Christie as he bursts into the United penalty area. He looks to get on the end of the pass in a dangerous position, but he can't get it under control and the ball bounces behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries go close! Sinisterra lays the ball into the path of Christie as Team_3 pounce on a loose ball inside the United half. The midfielder carries it forward and unleashes a powerful effort towards goal, but he narrowly misses the target as his shot flies over the bar and behind for a goal-kick.
Casemiro fails to control the ball in the middle of the pitch and it falls to Christie, who fires it out wide to Sinisterra. He drives into the penalty area and pulls it back to Christie, and he gets it out of his feet before taking aim, but Onana reads the situation well and gets across to make the save.
GOOOAAAALLLL!! 1-1! United equalise! Hojlund turns just outside the box and finds Garnacho, who looks to pull it back to the edge of the area. It comes to Rashford who finds Garnacho once again, and he fires the ball across goal and into the danger zone. It deflects into the air and Fernandes strikes it on the volley, and it fires into the roof of the net!
United look to counter-attack, but Senesi brings down Garnacho and receives the first yellow of the game.
Big chance for Team_3! Solanke carries the ball through the middle and slots a pass into the feet of Ouattara. He gets one-on-one with Kambwala and creates space for himself on his left foot, before firing a shot towards the bottom corner, but it whistles past the post. The Cherries were inches away from grabbing a second!
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!! 2-1 Team_3! Senesi carries the ball out of defence and picks out Kluivert, who has drifted into space between the United defence. He drives into the box and works it onto his right foot, and he sends a powerful strike into the bottom corner, and Onana can't get a hand to it!
Senesi was afforded plenty of space to carry the ball out of defence, and he picked out Kluivert with ease.
Team_3 have an injury problem right now as Sinisterra has gone to ground, and he looks in some discomfort. The medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment, and there's some activity on the bench. It looks as though he might struggle to continue.
Iraola makes the first change of the game, with the injured Sinisterra limping towards the bench. Kelly comes on in his place.
What a chance! Smith sends a first-time cross into the penalty area, and Kerkez has burst forward into the box. He rises above his marker and heads towards goal, but it cannons off the bar! It falls straight back into his path and he looks to head it into the back of the net, but this time he sends it over and behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries are good value for their lead in the first half, having produced 11 shots with four of those being on target. United have managed just three strikes, with Fernandes' shot the only one hitting the target. Conceding chances has been a major problem for the Red Devils this season, with only Team_17 giving up more shots this term.

There was almost late drama as Team_3 were given a stoppage-time penalty, but after a VAR review, the officials decided that the foul was committed outside of the area. Ten Hag's side have now won just once in their last seven Premier League games, while the Cherries, who finished with a higher xG (1.75 to 1.18), extend their unbeaten run at home to four matches. That's all for today, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal

Newcastle will be aiming to have another successful season under Eddie Howe after qualifying for the Champions League for the first time since the 2002-03 campaign last term. The Magpies finished in fourth place and have already strengthened their squad with the additions of Sandro Tonali, Harvey Barnes and Tino Livramento. Newcastle also remained unbeaten in their seven pre-season fixtures. Their preparations for the new campaign started with wins over Gateshead and Rangers before they travelled to the United States for the Premier League Summer Series. The 2023 EFL Cup finalists drew with Villa and Chelsea before securing a victory over Brighton and Hove Albion. Returning to England, Newcastle completed their fixtures with triumphs over Fiorentina and Villarreal.
Villa were around the relegation zone when Unai Emery replaced Steven Gerrard as manager but turned their form around and guided them to a seventh-place finish, their best in over a decade. The Villans will now have a chance to qualify for the group stages of the Europa Conference League if they beat Hibernian or Luzern in the playoffs. The Midlands outfit quickly signed Youri Tielemans, Pau Torres and Moussa Diaby ahead of the new season, with the trio all getting minutes in pre-season. Villa started their build-up to the campaign with a draw against Walsall before thrilling 3-3 encounters versus Newcastle and Brentford sandwiched a win over Fulham. Emery then led his side to victories over Lazio and Valencia in their next two matches. They will be looking to continue their form into this game and avoid a third consecutive loss on the first day of the season.

Newcastle manager Howe has handed a debut to Tonali, with the former Milan midfielder playing alongside Guimaraes and Joelinton in the middle of the pitch. Summer signings Livramento and Barnes are on the bench, with Isak preferred ahead of Wilson in the attack.
As for Villa, Diaby starts on the right wing after an impressive set of performances in pre-season. Konsa and Mings keep their place at the heart of the defence, meaning that Carlos and Torres are among the substitutes. Tielemans will also have to wait for his debut after signing in the summer.
Newcastle are unbeaten in their last 14 Premier League home games against Villa (winning eight and drawing six) since a 3-0 loss in April 2005.
Villa get this Premier League clash under way. McGinn with the first pass back to Luiz.
Newcastle have the first attack of the game. Gordon races down the left flank and plays a quick one-two with Joelinton. The former Everton winger gets into the final third and pulls a low cross into the middle of the box, but Mings is there to clear it away.
Guimaraes looks to create a chance and tries to thread a throughball into the box towards Isak. However, Mings gets across and stops him from receiving possession in a dangerous position.
Trippier has a free-kick on the left and swings a cross into the box. However, the captain puts in a poor delivery and Watkins launches it away.
GOAAALLLL! TONALI SCORES! 1-0 NEWCASTLE! What a start for the new signing. Guimaraes' attempt is saved, but the ball is only pushed away as far as Gordon. He plays a one-two with Joelinton before crossing towards Tonali, who gets ahead of Digne to score.
Gordon keeps looking to receive possession and has combined with Joelinton a couple of times in the opening exchanges of the game. This time he gets free of Cash before delivering a great cross to Tonali. The Italy international makes a late dash into the box and fires his shot into the corner.
Luiz is not happy and is showing his displeasure towards the referee. He is then shown a yellow card.
Tonali breaks free of Villa's defence and runs down the left side of the box. He has a chance to score his second of the game, but Martinez makes himself big and blocks the shot.
Villa have their first attempt of the game. Diaby rushes down the left side of the pitch on the counter and is chased by Gordon. The Newcastle man forces him wide, with Diaby's tame strike going straight at Pope.
GOALLLL! DIABY SCORES! 1-1! This game has started at an electric pace. McGinn keeps Villa's attack alive on the left next to the corner flag and curls a cross towards Watkins. The striker flicks the ball into the path of Diaby, with the new signing powering his shot into the top corner.
Watkins had a fantastic season for Villa last term and has shown his quality with this assist. He could have tried to score with a header but is aware of Diaby and flicks the ball back to him. Diaby is free and crashes his effort past Pope.
So far in 2023, only Manchester City have picked up more Premier League wins (17) and more Premier League points (53) than Villa (13 wins, 43 points). Indeed, their haul of 43 points is already more than they picked up in the whole of 2022 (41). They reacted quickly to going behind and now have the momentum in this fixture.
GOALLL! ISAK SCORES! 2-1 NEWCASTLE! The home side have their lead back through Isak! Trippier plays a short free-kick across to Tonali, who curls his cross into the box. Botman throws his leg at the ball to direct a cross towards Isak, with the striker free in the middle. He is ready for the chance and drives his low effort past Martinez. There was a short VAR check for offside but the goal is allowed.
Botman bursts into the box to get on the end of Tonali's cross and slides to the floor to connect with the ball and keep the attack alive. His pass is perfectly set for Isak who has a simple finish.
Newcastle have won their opening league game in two of the last three seasons (losing one), having done so in just one of their previous 12 campaigns (drawing four and losing seven). Following their 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest last season. The Magpies are looking to win their opening league game in consecutive campaigns for the first time since 2006-07/2007-08.
Villa will be disappointed at conceding so quickly after finding an equaliser. However, they allowed Newcastle to commit men forward after conceding a poor free-kick.
Digne flashes a cross into the box from the left. It goes over the head of Watkins and towards Diaby, but it bounces ahead of him and out for a goal-kick.
Isak gets down the right side of the pitch and looks to slot the ball into the path of Almiron. However, his touch is poor and the chance escapes him.
CHANCE! Diaby has been Villa's best player so far. He receives possession just outside the box on the right and holds onto it waiting for support. Watkins makes a darting run and gets onto the end of his low cross but drags his attempt wide.
Mings is down after the chance. He collided with Isak and needs medical assistance. The Newcastle striker is next to him to check on his condition.
It looks like Mings will need to come off. Torres is stretching on the side of the pitch and is ready to come on.
Mings is taken off on a stretcher and the entire stadium are on their feet applauding the Villa man.
A sad ending to the opening game of the season for Mings, who comes off on a stretcher after colliding with Isak. Torres comes to make his Premier League debut.
Digne is shown the first yellow card of the game after the bottom of his boot hits Almiron's hand. The Newcastle man was trying to collect the ball after it had rolled off the pitch.
Torres has started the game brightly after coming on as a substitute. He protects the ball from Isak before rolling past a pressing attacker to retain possession.
Digne has a corner on the right and curls an inviting cross towards Luiz. He escapes his marker and heads the ball across the goal, but it is cleared away.
Newcastle are having the majority of the possession, with Tonali and Guimaraes dictating the tempo of the game. The latter of the pair looks to switch possession out to the right towards Trippier, but Digne gets across to put it out for a throw-in.
Bailey and Diaby have looked threatening on the wings and are being helped by the overlapping full-backs. However, they are lacking a final pass when they get into the wide areas. They have not got Watkins involved enough, with the striker having just 10 touches to this point.
WIDE! Diaby has possession just outside the box and is forced back, playing a pass to Luiz. The duo play a fast one-two with Diaby escaping his markers and moving into the box, but he lashes his attempt from a narrow angle against the side of the net.
The ball is launched out of Newcastle's defence, allowing Trippier to burst out of his usual position and into an attacking position. He takes a touch past Digne, but cannot keep it under control. He is furious with the referee as he believes he is fouled by the left-back.
There will be 10 minutes of additional time.
Guimaraes has possession inside Villa's box and has Isak to his left demanding the ball. However, his pass is poor and the away side get it away. Trippier recovers it and looks to curl a cross into a dangerous area, but Martinez runs out to claim.
Tonali has shown his quality on his debut and looks to start an attack, switching the play from right to left towards Gordon. However, the winger cannot get the ball under control and is rolls out for a throw-in. Gordon puts his hand in the air to apologise for the mistake.
Diaby breaks down the right and drives into the middle of the pitch before delivering a pass to Watkins. He tries to make space on the edge of the box to get a shot away, but he is crowded out by the Newcastle defence.
Villa are shown their second yellow card of the game, but Newcastle want it to be a red. Almiron runs down the right and pokes the ball past Martinez, who rushes out of his box to try and win possession. He then pulls down the 29-year-old and is booked.
Botman is shown a yellow card after complaining to the referee. He wanted Martinez to get sent off for his foul on Almiron.
Burn gets on the end of the following free-kick but cannot get his attempt on target.
HALF-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 2-1 ASTON VILLA
Newcastle are leading at the break thanks to goals from Tonali and Isak. The Magpies broke the deadlock after just six minutes through debutant Tonali, with the Italy international getting on the end of Gordon's cross to fire his shot into the bottom corner. Villa then levelled through a new signing of their own. McGinn's cross was flicked towards Diaby by Watkins, with the winger darting into space before blasting his strike into the bottom corner. However, Isak restored Newcastle's lead five minutes later. Botman prodded Tonali's cross into the heart of the box. Isak was there to attack it and powered a low effort beyond the goalkeeper. Diaby then had a chance to score his second on his first appearance for Villa but lashed his shot from a narrow angle into the side of the net.
Newcastle have been the better side and will look to continue their strong performance after the break. Gordon has been electric on the left side of the pitch and has pushed Cash towards his own goal. Additionally, he has combined with Burn to stop Diaby from progressing forward. The midfield trio of Tonali, Guimaraes and Joelinton have also impressed and will only improve as the season progresses. As for Villa, Diaby has been one of their few bright sparks and has almost single-handedly given them an attacking presence. Watkins has had a couple of nice touches but has not been involved in the game enough.
Villa make their second substitution of the game, with another debutant making an appearance. Tielemans replaces Bailey, with the winger struggling to make an impact on the game.
Newcastle get the ball rolling again. They did not make a change at the break.
Newcastle have won their last 12 Premier League matches when leading at half-time, dating back to 31st August 2022 against Liverpool (L1-2).
Gordon has caused Cash a host of problems so far, with the right-back now going into the book for fouling the 22-year-old. Gordon was breaking away before being pulled to the floor.
Trippier plays a short one-two from a corner before playing a pass out to Tonali. He looks to curl a cross into the box with his right foot but does not get any height on it, allowing Watkins to clear.
Diaby looks to make things happen every time he receives possession. This time he turns on the ball and looks to switch a pass out to the left to Digne inside Newcastle's half, but Trippier reads his attempt and makes the interception.
Almiron rushes down the left flank before whipping a low cross into the heart of the box. Isak tries to get on the end of it but it flashes past his outstretched foot.
Gordon now goes into the book after a late tackle on Cash. They have had an intense battle so far.
Luiz plays a smart throughball down the left channel to Digne, who is unmarked. He tries to send a low cross into the box but Schar clears it behind. Luiz has had a bright start to the half and is constantly looking to make positive passes forward.
GOALLL! ISAK SCORES AGAIN! 3-1 NEWCASTLE! That is a sublime finish from Isak. Gordon's pass towards the striker is intercepted by Konsa, who is forced back towards his goal by the striker. Trying to roll the ball with the bottom of his foot inside the box, he misses it completely, allowing Isak to gain possession. He is one-on-one with Martinez and chips his shot over the goalkeeper.
Isak is the first Newcastle player since Obafemi Martins in 2007-08 to score twice for Newcastle in their opening game of a Premier League season.
CHANCE FOR A HAT-TRICK! Almiron breaks down the middle of the pitch with possession before slotting a throughball into the path of Isak inside the box. The striker only has Martinez to beat but blasts his strike straight at the goalkeeper.
Joelinton races behind Villa's defence trying to get onto a pass over the top but is beaten to it by Martinez. He is outside the box and heads the ball out to the right, but can only find Almiron. He looks to score Newcastle's fourth but cannot get any power on his shot, with the goalkeeper scampering across to make the save.
Villa make their third change of the game and their captain makes his way off. McGinn is replaced by Carlos.
CHANCE! Cash has to score. Diaby slides a pass down the left side to Watkins, who cuts the ball onto his right foot and past a defender before powering a shot towards the goal. Pope pushes it away, but only as far as Cash who shoots over from close range. Diaby has his head in his hands.
Against no side have Newcastle United won more Premier League games than they have against Aston Villa (24, level with Tottenham), while they've also beaten the Villans more often in their overall league history than they have any other opponent (71).
Guimaraes is shown the seventh yellow card of the game after raising his arm in the air, wanting a Villa player to be shown a card for a foul on Tonali.
Gordon has had a fantastic game on the left side of the pitch and is now being given a rest. Barnes is on for his Newcastle debut.
Howe is ruthless with his substitutions and denies Isak the chance of a hat-trick. Wilson takes his place and will lead the attack.
Wilson has scored 11 goals in his last 12 Premier League games, averaging a goal every 58 minutes in this run. Indeed, since the start of April, Wilson is the highest scorer in the competition overall (11).
Tonali switches the play from right to left, allowing Barnes to get involved for the first time. He switches possession onto his left foot and whips a cross into the box towards Wilson, but Carlos dives across to get his head on it.
Diaby has not been able to impact the game the same way in the second half as he was able to in the first. The Newcastle defence get tight with him every time he receives possession and does not let him have any space to work with.
Cash has possession on the right and touches the ball past Burn before driving a cross into the box. It is goal-bound, forcing Pope to push it behind for a corner.
Guimaraes has possession and launches a pass out to the left to Barnes. He cannot get there but forces Cash to clear it away for a throw-in.
GOALLL! WILSON SCORES! 4-1 NEWCASTLE! What an impact from the substitute. Two new signings combine, with Tonali threading a pass down the left to Barnes. The former Leicester City winger beats the offside trap and moves into the box before sliding a pass into the feet of Wilson, who powers his effort into the top corner. There was a short VAR check for offside against Barnes, but the goal stands.
Barnes makes an immediate impression in front of his new fans. The winger races onto Tonali's throughball and has a chance to shoot, but plays a smart pass across to Wilson, who has a much easier finish.
Since the start of last season, Wilson has scored more Premier League goals as a substitute (five) than any other player.
SAVE! Wilson should have scored again. Barnes breaks away from Villa's defence and into the end of a pass from Joelinton. He dribbles forward with possession and waits for support, slotting a pass across to Wilson. He is free in the middle but has his shot from close range blocked by the legs of Martinez.
OFF THE LINE! Joelinton gets his head onto a corner and powers his attempt into the ground. Martinez might have got a faint touch on the ball but is going in before a clearance off the line from Watkins.
The Newcastle fans are cheering every successful pass. They have been comfortable in this game since scoring their second goal and have only been tested on a couple of occasions by Villa's attack.
Guimaraes has combined well with Tonali in the midfield and has been crucial for Newcastle in this game. He is given a rest and is replaced by Longstaff.
Almiron has not got a goal or an assist but has caused a lot of problems for Villa on the wings. Murphy takes his place for the final few minutes.
Diaby has been quiet since the restart after being in the middle of the action before the break. Coutinho is given the rest of the game to make an impact.
Cash has had a difficult game against Gordon and Barnes. He is replaced by Philogene-Bidace.
Coutinho is trying to make things happen and carries the ball forward before being forced back by Newcastle's defence. They have protected their box well and are not giving away many chances.
GOALLL! BARNES SCORES! 5-1 NEWCASTLE! The Magpies are making a statement to the rest of the league on the opening weekend of the season. Barnes races onto the end of a pass from Murphy and drives into the box. He gets down the left and has Wilson in the middle, but goes for the goal himself and curls his shot into the bottom corner.
Murphy holds onto possession on the halfway line before flicking a pass into the feet of Barnes, who escapes the Villa defence for the third time since coming on. He has options for a pass but scores himself with a calm finish into the corner.
Tonali wastes time on his way off the pitch and is shown a yellow card.
Tonali has had a dream debut and is now coming off. Anderson impressed during pre-season and is now coming on.
Luiz is over a free-kick on the right and looks for the top corner from a narrow-angle, but Pope reads his intentions and pushes it behind for a corner.
Murphy ignores a run from Barnes before chipping a pass over the top of Villa's defence towards Wilson. The striker looks to have beaten Konsa, but the centre-back gets back to slide the ball away.
FULL-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 5-1 ASTON VILLA
Newcastle trounced Villa 5-1 to move to the top of the Premier League table. Tonali opened the scoring on his debut, darting onto a cross from Gordon to poke his attempt past Martinez. Diaby then crashed in an equaliser on his first start for Villa before the Magpies took complete control of the fixture. Isak scored either side of half-time to give Newcastle a comfortable advantage, with Cash missing a glorious chance to halve the deficit. Wilson was unfortunate not to start but came off the bench to score his first of the season, getting on the end of an inviting pass across the box from Barnes. The former Leicester man then netted his first and Newcastle's fifth, rushing onto the end of a throughball from Murphy before curling his effort into the bottom corner.
Newcastle only lost twice at home last season and started their season at  St. James' Park with an emphatic win over Aston Villa. Next up, they travel to Premier League champions Manchester City. As for Villa, they will be disappointed that the game escaped them after equalising. They will be looking to secure their first victory of the season when they host Everton.

However, Isak restored Team_15 lead five minutes later. Botman prodded Tonali's cross into the heart of the box. Isak was there to attack it and powered a low effort beyond the goalkeeper. Diaby then had a chance to score his second on his first appearance for Villa but lashed his shot from a narrow angle into the side of the net.
Team_15 have been the better side and will look to continue their strong performance after the break. Gordon has been electric on the left side of the pitch and has pushed Cash towards his own goal. Additionally, he has combined with Burn to stop Diaby from progressing forward. The midfield trio of Tonali, Guimaraes and Joelinton have also impressed and will only improve as the season progresses. As for Villa, Diaby has been one of their few bright sparks and has almost single-handedly given them an attacking presence. Watkins has had a couple of nice touches but has not been involved in the game enough.
Villa make their second substitution of the game, with another debutant making an appearance. Tielemans replaces Bailey, with the winger struggling to make an impact on the game.
Team_15 get the ball rolling again. They did not make a change at the break.
Team_15 have won their last 12 Premier League matches when leading at half-time, dating back to 31st August 2022 against Team_11 (L1-2).
Gordon has caused Cash a host of problems so far, with the right-back now going into the book for fouling the 22-year-old. Gordon was breaking away before being pulled to the floor.
Trippier plays a short one-two from a corner before playing a pass out to Tonali. He looks to curl a cross into the box with his right foot but does not get any height on it, allowing Watkins to clear.
Diaby looks to make things happen every time he receives possession. This time he turns on the ball and looks to switch a pass out to the left to Digne inside Team_15 half, but Trippier reads his attempt and makes the interception.
Almiron rushes down the left flank before whipping a low cross into the heart of the box. Isak tries to get on the end of it but it flashes past his outstretched foot.
Gordon now goes into the book after a late tackle on Cash. They have had an intense battle so far.
Luiz plays a smart throughball down the left channel to Digne, who is unmarked. He tries to send a low cross into the box but Schar clears it behind. Luiz has had a bright start to the half and is constantly looking to make positive passes forward.
GOALLL! ISAK SCORES AGAIN! 3-1 Team_15! That is a sublime finish from Isak. Gordon's pass towards the striker is intercepted by Konsa, who is forced back towards his goal by the striker. Trying to roll the ball with the bottom of his foot inside the box, he misses it completely, allowing Isak to gain possession. He is one-on-one with Martinez and chips his shot over the goalkeeper.
Isak is the first Team_15 player since Obafemi Martins in 2007-08 to score twice for Team_15 in their opening game of a Premier League season.
CHANCE FOR A HAT-TRICK! Almiron breaks down the middle of the pitch with possession before slotting a throughball into the path of Isak inside the box. The striker only has Martinez to beat but blasts his strike straight at the goalkeeper.
Joelinton races behind Villa's defence trying to get onto a pass over the top but is beaten to it by Martinez. He is outside the box and heads the ball out to the right, but can only find Almiron. He looks to score Team_15 fourth but cannot get any power on his shot, with the goalkeeper scampering across to make the save.
Villa make their third change of the game and their captain makes his way off. McGinn is replaced by Carlos.
CHANCE! Cash has to score. Diaby slides a pass down the left side to Watkins, who cuts the ball onto his right foot and past a defender before powering a shot towards the goal. Pope pushes it away, but only as far as Cash who shoots over from close range. Diaby has his head in his hands.
Against no side have Team_15 won more Premier League games than they have against Team_2 (24, level with Team_18), while they've also beaten the Villans more often in their overall league history than they have any other opponent (71).
Guimaraes is shown the seventh yellow card of the game after raising his arm in the air, wanting a Villa player to be shown a card for a foul on Tonali.
Gordon has had a fantastic game on the left side of the pitch and is now being given a rest. Barnes is on for his Team_15 debut.
Howe is ruthless with his substitutions and denies Isak the chance of a hat-trick. Wilson takes his place and will lead the attack.
Wilson has scored 11 goals in his last 12 Premier League games, averaging a goal every 58 minutes in this run. Indeed, since the start of April, Wilson is the highest scorer in the competition overall (11).
Tonali switches the play from right to left, allowing Barnes to get involved for the first time. He switches possession onto his left foot and whips a cross into the box towards Wilson, but Carlos dives across to get his head on it.
Diaby has not been able to impact the game the same way in the second half as he was able to in the first. The Team_15 defence get tight with him every time he receives possession and does not let him have any space to work with.
Cash has possession on the right and touches the ball past Burn before driving a cross into the box. It is goal-bound, forcing Pope to push it behind for a corner.
Guimaraes has possession and launches a pass out to the left to Barnes. He cannot get there but forces Cash to clear it away for a throw-in.
GOALLL! WILSON SCORES! 4-1 Team_15! What an impact from the substitute. Two new signings combine, with Tonali threading a pass down the left to Barnes. The former Leicester City winger beats the offside trap and moves into the box before sliding a pass into the feet of Wilson, who powers his effort into the top corner. There was a short VAR check for offside against Barnes, but the goal stands.
Barnes makes an immediate impression in front of his new fans. The winger races onto Tonali's throughball and has a chance to shoot, but plays a smart pass across to Wilson, who has a much easier finish.
Since the start of last season, Wilson has scored more Premier League goals as a substitute (five) than any other player.
SAVE! Wilson should have scored again. Barnes breaks away from Villa's defence and into the end of a pass from Joelinton. He dribbles forward with possession and waits for support, slotting a pass across to Wilson. He is free in the middle but has his shot from close range blocked by the legs of Martinez.
OFF THE LINE! Joelinton gets his head onto a corner and powers his attempt into the ground. Martinez might have got a faint touch on the ball but is going in before a clearance off the line from Watkins.
The Team_15 fans are cheering every successful pass. They have been comfortable in this game since scoring their second goal and have only been tested on a couple of occasions by Villa's attack.
Guimaraes has combined well with Tonali in the midfield and has been crucial for Team_15 in this game. He is given a rest and is replaced by Longstaff.
Almiron has not got a goal or an assist but has caused a lot of problems for Villa on the wings. Murphy takes his place for the final few minutes.
Diaby has been quiet since the restart after being in the middle of the action before the break. Coutinho is given the rest of the game to make an impact.
Cash has had a difficult game against Gordon and Barnes. He is replaced by Philogene-Bidace.
Coutinho is trying to make things happen and carries the ball forward before being forced back by Team_15 defence. They have protected their box well and are not giving away many chances.
GOALLL! BARNES SCORES! 5-1 Team_15! The Magpies are making a statement to the rest of the league on the opening weekend of the season. Barnes races onto the end of a pass from Murphy and drives into the box. He gets down the left and has Wilson in the middle, but goes for the goal himself and curls his shot into the bottom corner.
Murphy holds onto possession on the halfway line before flicking a pass into the feet of Barnes, who escapes the Villa defence for the third time since coming on. He has options for a pass but scores himself with a calm finish into the corner.
Tonali wastes time on his way off the pitch and is shown a yellow card.
Tonali has had a dream debut and is now coming off. Anderson impressed during pre-season and is now coming on.
Luiz is over a free-kick on the right and looks for the top corner from a narrow-angle, but Pope reads his intentions and pushes it behind for a corner.
Murphy ignores a run from Barnes before chipping a pass over the top of Villa's defence towards Wilson. The striker looks to have beaten Konsa, but the centre-back gets back to slide the ball away.
FULL-TIME: Team_15 5-1 Team_2
Team_15 trounced Villa 5-1 to move to the top of the Premier League table. Tonali opened the scoring on his debut, darting onto a cross from Gordon to poke his attempt past Martinez. Diaby then crashed in an equaliser on his first start for Villa before the Magpies took complete control of the fixture. Isak scored either side of half-time to give Team_15 a comfortable advantage, with Cash missing a glorious chance to halve the deficit. Wilson was unfortunate not to start but came off the bench to score his first of the season, getting on the end of an inviting pass across the box from Barnes. The former Leicester man then netted his first and Team_15 fifth, rushing onto the end of a throughball from Murphy before curling his effort into the bottom corner.
Team_15 only lost twice at home last season and started their season at  St. James' Park with an emphatic win over Team_2. Next up, they travel to Premier League champions Team_13. As for Villa, they will be disappointed that the game escaped them after equalising. They will be looking to secure their first victory of the season when they host Team_9.
That's all at St. James' Park, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	Exciting
93385	Man Utd	Crystal Palace	2023-09-30	Old Trafford, Manchester	73428.0	Chris Kavanagh	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Newcastle United and Brentford at St James' Park!
Newcastle opened their season in style with a 5-1 thrashing of Aston Villa, but things have since turned on their head. They've followed that up with three consecutive defeats to Manchester City, Liverpool and Brighton and Hove Albion, and Eddie Howe will be looking to get them back to winning ways today. As for Brentford, they've made an unbeaten start to this campaign, but have won just one of their four matches so far - a 3-0 win over Fulham - while drawing the other three.
NEWCASTLE UNITED STARTING XI (4-3-3): Nick Pope; Kieran Trippier, Fabian Schar, Sven Botman, Dan Burn; Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Elliot Anderson; Harvey Barnes, Callum Wilson, Anthony Gordon.
NEWCASTLE UNITED SUBS: Martin Dubravka, Sandro Tonali, Valentino Livramento, Lewis Hall, Jamaal Lascelles, Jacob Murphy, Matt Targett, Miguel Almiron, Alexander Isak.
BRENTFORD STARTING XI (5-3-2): Mark Flekken; Aaron Hickey, Nathan Collins, Ethan Pinnock, Ben Mee, Rico Henry; Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt; Bryan Mbuemo, Yoanne Wissa.
BRENTFORD SUBS: Keane Lewis-Potter, Frank Onyeka, Thomas Strakosha, Kevin Schade, Yehor Yarmolyuk, Mads Roerslev, Neal Maupay, Saman Ghoddos, Zanka.
Howe makes five changes from the loss to Brighton last time out. Botman returns from an ankle injury to start, with Longstaff, Anderson, Barnes and Wilson also coming in. Targett, Almiron and Isak start on the bench, as does Tonali, who picked up a muscle problem on international duty. Joelinton isn't in the squad.
There's just one change by Thomas Frank to the side that started against Bournemouth before the break. They switch to a back five, so Collins slots in as the extra defender. Schade drops to the bench.
Newcastle have won seven of their last eight league games against Brentford (D1) in a run stretching back to 1992. In that time, the Magpies have netted 24 goals against them.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Longstaff gets the game underway for Newcastle!
Newcastle are looking to make a quick start to this game as they work it quickly upfield. Trippier finds space down the right and tries to clip it to Wilson on the edge of the box, but Mee hooks it away.
GOOD SAVE! Hickey's initial route to goal is blocked, but the half-clearance falls to Jensen, who picks out the midfielder with a clever reverse pass. This time, the defender hits a shot, which takes a deflection, but Pope gets behind it.
Newcastle move it quickly down their right once more, with Guimaraes nodding it out to Gordon. He bursts past Henry before lifting a deep cross into the box that clears everyone in the middle.
Brentford neatly play themselves out of a tight spot in their own half, but they can't find a way forward. Norgaard tries to dart through the middle, only to run into Anderson, and the visitors have to go back to their keeper.
Mbuemo has so much space to run into down the right, and he takes it to the byline before pulling it back into the middle. It's too far in front of Janelt at the near post, and Botman clears his lines before Wissa can get to it.
Norgaard outmuscles Schar to win the ball back just outside the Newcastle box, and it's quickly switched to Mbuemo on the right. He tries to scoop it in from the byline but sends it into the side netting.
Guimaraes curls a good pass forward, and it looks like Pinnock has it covered, but Gordon still chases him all the way. It's knocked back to Flekken, who properly clears the danger.
Since winning their first away league game against Newcastle 5-2 in September 1934, Brentford are winless in their last five visits to the Magpies (D1 L4).
Anderson does well to open up a pocket of space down the left and he lifts a cross into the middle for Wilson. Norgaard sticks out a leg just in time to get it away from him, and Anderson can't swing it in a second time.
Newcastle are starting to up the pressure a little here as Burn pushes forward down the left now. His cross is blocked though, as is Anderson's follow-up.
Trippier's free-kick is cleared by the first man, and Brentford break quickly on the counter. Pinnock switches it out to Jensen on the right, and he curls a dangerous cross towards the far post, but Wissa can't make contact.
Newcastle are starting to see more of the ball now, and they're patiently playing out from the back. Brentford are pressing high upfield, and making it difficult for the hosts to get forward.
Gordon slaloms his way through a crowd of Brentford players as he cuts inside from the right, but he can't open up space for a shot. He lays it off to Barnes, but the visitors are back in their compact shape.
GREAT SAVE! Trippier whips a great corner into the box and Botman rises high to nod it down to Guimaraes at the far post. He has a free header from close range, which Flekken keeps out with his legs, and Collins gets it away.
Brentford go for a more direct route to goal this time, Janelt lifting it over the top for Wissa to chase. He brings it down with a good first touch, but the flag goes up to stop the move.
Barnes fizzes a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box and Flekken gets fingertips to it to take it away from Longstaff. Newcastle come again though as Trippier clips one in, and Wilson heads over from close range.
Wissa catches Schar on the mouth with his elbow in an aerial challenge and is shown the first yellow card of the game.
Schar needs treatment after being caught by Wissa as his lip is bleeding. He's taken to the side of the pitch to be patched up, but he'll be able to carry on.
Newcastle's short free-kick down the right doesn't quite go as planned, but Trippier does manage to win a corner. That's curled into the near post, but Pinnock gets it away.
Henry is down by the corner flag holding his knee after being caught by Trippier. The medical team rush over to give him some treatment, but the wing-back looks to be in quite a bit of pain.
The stretcher is being walked over to Henry, but he is able to gingerly get back to his feet. He's limping his way around the side of the pitch, and his game is over.
Henry will be going straight down the tunnel with the medical team, and Roerslev is brought on in his place.
Barnes is driving through the middle when Norgaard slides in with a heavy challenge to bring him down from behind. He can have no complaints about that booking.
Trippier chooses to cross the resulting free-kick towards the far post, but it's cleared straight back out to him. This time, he goes for goal, volleying his first-time shot over the bar.
We're into five added minutes at the end of the half, and Newcastle are still pushing for an opener. Barnes weaves his way out to the left before curling another cross in, but it's cleared by Mee.
Brentford win a corner which is curled into the near post for Mbuemo. He gets caught under it slightly and thumps his header high over the bar.
Brentford have everyone back in their own half as they try to see out the last few seconds of stoppage time without conceding. Newcastle just can't find any space in behind.
HALF-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 0-0 BRENTFORD.
It's goalless at the break between Newcastle and Brentford. There were just two shots on target in the first half, though both of them forced great saves - Hickey was denied by Pope, who stood tall at his near post early on, while Flekken kept out Guimaraes' free header from point-blank range at the other end. Brentford started the game well, but the hosts grew into the game as it went on, without being able to find a breakthrough.
Newcastle made a slow start to the game, but Howe will be fairly pleased with their performance after that. They just need to be more clinical when they do get into the box. Brentford haven't made things easy though. Even though they didn't show as much of an attacking threat as the half went on, they were compact in defence and looked hard to break down.
Brentford get us back underway for the second half!
Gordon is trying to disrupt Brentford's early possession here so he races to close Hickey down. The wing-back gets the ball away in time, but the Newcastle winger hurts himself in the process. He can carry on without treatment.
Brentford win it deep in their own half, and Roerslev hooks it forward for Wissa to chase. He struggles to get it out of his feet, which allows Newcastle to get back, and the forward sees his shot blocked.
Trippier can't pick out a successful cross from the right, and when Schar swings it in, Flekken tips it out to Barnes on the left. He cuts inside before curling it towards the far post, but Gordon can't direct it on target.
Newcastle are unbeaten in their last 20 Premier League games that have been level at half-time (W8 D12) since a 5-1 defeat to Tottenham in April 2022, and are unbeaten in 16 such games at home (W8 D8) since losing 0-3 to Chelsea in October 2021.
Norgaard wins it back in midfield and slots it forward for Wissa. Newcastle are tightly man-marking at the moment though, and Botman intercepts to set the hosts on the counter.
NO GOAL! It's a scramble in the box as Collins' header loops up into the air, and Wilson backs into Flekken. The keeper misses his punch and Gordon's shot pinballs towards goal before Wilson helps it over the line from close range. The referee says it's a foul on the keeper though, and it won't count. Still 0-0!
A dangerous ball is whipped in from the right for Brentford and after Wissa misses it, Hickey catches Pope with a late foul. He's booked for it.
PENALTY TO NEWCASTLE! Hickey knocked the ball back to Flekken, not realising that Gordon was rushing in behind him. The wing-back can't stop him from getting to it, and the Brentford goalkeeper then trips the winger as he tries to clear it. The referee takes a moment to think about it before pointing to the spot.
Brentford can't believe that the penalty has gone against them, but their arguments are falling on deaf ears. The referee shepherds them out of the box as Wilson puts the ball on the spot, but he'll have to wait a bit longer.
WILSON SCORES! There's no saving that one! Despite being made to wait, it's a confident penalty from the forward as he sends a powerful strike high into the top-right corner. Flekken dived the right way, but no keeper is reaching that. 1-0 Newcastle!
Flekken is still complaining about the penalty being awarded against him, and the referee has had enough as he books him for dissent.
Brentford look to make a quick response to going behind by working it into Newcastle's box straight from the restart. It's pulled back to Mbuemo on the edge of the box, but he slices a shot well wide.
This game has opened right up in the last 10 minutes or so and Barnes is almost slipped through the gap in the middle. He's forced wide by Mee but still manages to pick out Guimaraes, who fires a shot high over the bar.
Mee has gone down off the ball and he's holding his ankle. The medical team are on to give him some treatment, but he's going to carry on for now.
Brentford are going to make a triple change as they try to get back into this game. They're taking no chances with Mee as he's replaced by Maupay.
Janelt is also taken off, with Schade on for him.
And Onyeka comes on for Norgaard.
Wilson is being chased around the penalty area by Roerslev as Newcastle wait to take their corner. When Trippier does curl it into the box, he can't pick out a team-mate, and Brentford get it away.
Wilson has scored 15 of his 16 penalties in the Premier League, with his only miss from the spot coming against Cardiff City in August 2018 for Bournemouth.
Schade makes a great run down the left and gets a yard on Botman to play it towards the near post. There isn't enough curl on the pass to pick out Wissa, and Pope comfortably collects.
PENALTY TO NEWCASTLE! The hosts have another spot-kick! Gordon clips a good cross in from the right and Mbuemo is marking Barnes at the far post. He nods it down onto the Brentford forward's hand, which is level with his shoulder, and the referee points to the spot again. However, the VAR may get involved with this one...
NO PENALTY! VAR is having a look at the penalty decision, and they've asked Craig Pawson to go over to the monitor. Barnes did have his hands on Mbuemo, using the player to get up to meet the cross, which caused Mbuemo's arms to come up. After watching the replays, the decision is overturned.
Brentford are making their final change following that VAR decision. Hickey is the one going off, with Lewis-Potter on in his place.
Newcastle are also using the opportunity to make their first swap. Barnes is taken off, with Almiron on for him.
Collins attempts to drag Wilson back, and when that doesn't work, he stretches across him to block the run. He's complaining, but it won't stop the referee from showing him a yellow card.
Wissa stretches to make the interception, and Maupay rushes onto it before sliding it to Schade to his left. He knocks it past Burn with his first touch, but the defender recovers well to block the shot.
Brentford are still pushing to try and get something out of this game, but their passing is suffering from their frantic need to get it forward. Jensen tries to hook it forward for Mbuemo, but it's an easy interception for Schar.
Into the first of nine added minutes here, and Brentford are still on the ball. Schade carries it forward down the right, but can't pick out a cross as Newcastle have nearly everyone back in their box.
WIDE! Schar slides in with a late challenge on Wissa, and Brentford have a free-kick near the byline on the left. It's swung into the crowd, and Barnes' glancing header helps it onto Wissa, who nods it wide of the post.
Gordon was convinced he should've had a throw-in and reacted angrily when the referee gave it Brentford's way. He's booked for dissent.
Wilson's frustration about the decision was also on show as he pushed Onyeka away to stop him from taking the throw-in before shouting at the referee. He's booked for his double act of dissent.
The yellow card is out again, this time for Guimaraes. He didn't get a free-kick that he wanted and then clipped Lewis-Potter late in his annoyance.
Newcastle are pressing high upfield in an attempt to keep Brentford out of their half. The visitors are still trying to pass their way out from the back, but they're running out of time.
FULL-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 1-0 BRENTFORD.
Newcastle get back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory against Brentford. It was a very tight first half, with both keepers making a great save apiece to keep things level. Newcastle upped the pressure after the break though, and thought they'd taken the lead when Wilson bundled it over the line, only for it to be ruled out for a foul on Flekken. Just moments later, the Bees keeper tripped Gordon to give away a penalty that was confidently dispatched by Wilson. The hosts were awarded another spot-kick late on for a handball by Mbuemo, but VAR overturned the decision due to a foul on the forward just before it.
That win lifts Newcastle up to 11th place, now level on points with Brentford, but they sit below the Bees on goal difference. Next up for them is the Champions League, where they face Milan on Tuesday. Brentford's unbeaten start to the season is over, and they'll be hoping to bounce back against Everton next weekend.
That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Crystal Palace handed Manchester United a fourth league defeat of the season, winning 1-0 at Old Trafford. 
Four days after Man Utd had beaten Palace 3-0 in the EFL Cup at Old Trafford the Eagles got their revenge thanks to a wonderful goal from Joachim Andersen. 
The centre-back’s goal came in the 25th minute, as a headed clearance fell to him and the Dane swivelled to volley a fierce shot into the top corner. 
Man Utd dominated most of the match but could not get the equaliser in the Manchester rain. Mason Mount, on his first league start for Man Utd in six weeks, almost equalised but could only head over on 70 minutes. 
Three minutes later they came even closer as substitute Alejandro Garnacho crossed from the left and the ball brushed the far post after a double Palace deflection. 
Then Garnacho saw a shot deflected wide. 
Palace held on to give manager Roy Hodgson a third successive win at Old Trafford and climb to ninth with 10 points, a place higher and a point more than Man Utd, who suffered back-to-back home defeats. 
Man Utd report | Crystal Palace report
Erik ten Hag: ""It's a bad start. We have to catch up and do better. This is not good enough.
""Of course, it's frustrating for everyone, especially the fans. It's frustrating but for us, as well, the players and for me. We have to stay together, fight together and get better and make sure we get improvement."" See more
Roy Hodgson: “I’m most happy about the way the team played today, and I’m so pleased for the players.
“It wasn’t easy coming up here for the second time in a few days, but to give that performance and to work that hard and defend as well as we did throughout the 90 minutes, that’s what gives me the most satisfaction."" See more

Barnes fizzes a dangerous low cross into the six-yard box and Flekken gets fingertips to it to take it away from Longstaff. Team_15 come again though as Trippier clips one in, and Wilson heads over from close range.
Wissa catches Schar on the mouth with his elbow in an aerial challenge and is shown the first yellow card of the game.
Schar needs treatment after being caught by Wissa as his lip is bleeding. He's taken to the side of the pitch to be patched up, but he'll be able to carry on.
Team_15 short free-kick down the right doesn't quite go as planned, but Trippier does manage to win a corner. That's curled into the near post, but Pinnock gets it away.
Henry is down by the corner flag holding his knee after being caught by Trippier. The medical team rush over to give him some treatment, but the wing-back looks to be in quite a bit of pain.
The stretcher is being walked over to Henry, but he is able to gingerly get back to his feet. He's limping his way around the side of the pitch, and his game is over.
Henry will be going straight down the tunnel with the medical team, and Roerslev is brought on in his place.
Barnes is driving through the middle when Norgaard slides in with a heavy challenge to bring him down from behind. He can have no complaints about that booking.
Trippier chooses to cross the resulting free-kick towards the far post, but it's cleared straight back out to him. This time, he goes for goal, volleying his first-time shot over the bar.
We're into five added minutes at the end of the half, and Team_15 are still pushing for an opener. Barnes weaves his way out to the left before curling another cross in, but it's cleared by Mee.
Team_4 win a corner which is curled into the near post for Mbuemo. He gets caught under it slightly and thumps his header high over the bar.
Team_4 have everyone back in their own half as they try to see out the last few seconds of stoppage time without conceding. Team_15 just can't find any space in behind.
HALF-TIME: Team_15 0-0 Team_4.
It's goalless at the break between Team_15 and Team_4. There were just two shots on target in the first half, though both of them forced great saves - Hickey was denied by Pope, who stood tall at his near post early on, while Flekken kept out Guimaraes' free header from point-blank range at the other end. Team_4 started the game well, but the hosts grew into the game as it went on, without being able to find a breakthrough.
Team_15 made a slow start to the game, but Howe will be fairly pleased with their performance after that. They just need to be more clinical when they do get into the box. Team_4 haven't made things easy though. Even though they didn't show as much of an attacking threat as the half went on, they were compact in defence and looked hard to break down.
Team_4 get us back underway for the second half!
Gordon is trying to disrupt Team_4 early possession here so he races to close Hickey down. The wing-back gets the ball away in time, but the Team_15 winger hurts himself in the process. He can carry on without treatment.
Team_4 win it deep in their own half, and Roerslev hooks it forward for Wissa to chase. He struggles to get it out of his feet, which allows Team_15 to get back, and the forward sees his shot blocked.
Trippier can't pick out a successful cross from the right, and when Schar swings it in, Flekken tips it out to Barnes on the left. He cuts inside before curling it towards the far post, but Gordon can't direct it on target.
Team_15 are unbeaten in their last 20 Premier League games that have been level at half-time (W8 D12) since a 5-1 defeat to Team_18 in April 2022, and are unbeaten in 16 such games at home (W8 D8) since losing 0-3 to Team_7 in October 2021.
Norgaard wins it back in midfield and slots it forward for Wissa. Team_15 are tightly man-marking at the moment though, and Botman intercepts to set the hosts on the counter.
NO GOAL! It's a scramble in the box as Collins' header loops up into the air, and Wilson backs into Flekken. The keeper misses his punch and Gordon's shot pinballs towards goal before Wilson helps it over the line from close range. The referee says it's a foul on the keeper though, and it won't count. Still 0-0!
A dangerous ball is whipped in from the right for Team_4 and after Wissa misses it, Hickey catches Pope with a late foul. He's booked for it.
PENALTY TO Team_15! Hickey knocked the ball back to Flekken, not realising that Gordon was rushing in behind him. The wing-back can't stop him from getting to it, and the Team_4 goalkeeper then trips the winger as he tries to clear it. The referee takes a moment to think about it before pointing to the spot.
Team_4 can't believe that the penalty has gone against them, but their arguments are falling on deaf ears. The referee shepherds them out of the box as Wilson puts the ball on the spot, but he'll have to wait a bit longer.
WILSON SCORES! There's no saving that one! Despite being made to wait, it's a confident penalty from the forward as he sends a powerful strike high into the top-right corner. Flekken dived the right way, but no keeper is reaching that. 1-0 Team_15!
Flekken is still complaining about the penalty being awarded against him, and the referee has had enough as he books him for dissent.
Team_4 look to make a quick response to going behind by working it into Team_15 box straight from the restart. It's pulled back to Mbuemo on the edge of the box, but he slices a shot well wide.
This game has opened right up in the last 10 minutes or so and Barnes is almost slipped through the gap in the middle. He's forced wide by Mee but still manages to pick out Guimaraes, who fires a shot high over the bar.
Mee has gone down off the ball and he's holding his ankle. The medical team are on to give him some treatment, but he's going to carry on for now.
Team_4 are going to make a triple change as they try to get back into this game. They're taking no chances with Mee as he's replaced by Maupay.
Janelt is also taken off, with Schade on for him.
And Onyeka comes on for Norgaard.
Wilson is being chased around the penalty area by Roerslev as Team_15 wait to take their corner. When Trippier does curl it into the box, he can't pick out a team-mate, and Team_4 get it away.
Wilson has scored 15 of his 16 penalties in the Premier League, with his only miss from the spot coming against Cardiff City in August 2018 for Team_3.
Schade makes a great run down the left and gets a yard on Botman to play it towards the near post. There isn't enough curl on the pass to pick out Wissa, and Pope comfortably collects.
PENALTY TO Team_15! The hosts have another spot-kick! Gordon clips a good cross in from the right and Mbuemo is marking Barnes at the far post. He nods it down onto the Team_4 forward's hand, which is level with his shoulder, and the referee points to the spot again. However, the VAR may get involved with this one...
NO PENALTY! VAR is having a look at the penalty decision, and they've asked Craig Pawson to go over to the monitor. Barnes did have his hands on Mbuemo, using the player to get up to meet the cross, which caused Mbuemo's arms to come up. After watching the replays, the decision is overturned.
Team_4 are making their final change following that VAR decision. Hickey is the one going off, with Lewis-Potter on in his place.
Team_15 are also using the opportunity to make their first swap. Barnes is taken off, with Almiron on for him.
Collins attempts to drag Wilson back, and when that doesn't work, he stretches across him to block the run. He's complaining, but it won't stop the referee from showing him a yellow card.
Wissa stretches to make the interception, and Maupay rushes onto it before sliding it to Schade to his left. He knocks it past Burn with his first touch, but the defender recovers well to block the shot.
Team_4 are still pushing to try and get something out of this game, but their passing is suffering from their frantic need to get it forward. Jensen tries to hook it forward for Mbuemo, but it's an easy interception for Schar.
Into the first of nine added minutes here, and Team_4 are still on the ball. Schade carries it forward down the right, but can't pick out a cross as Team_15 have nearly everyone back in their box.
WIDE! Schar slides in with a late challenge on Wissa, and Team_4 have a free-kick near the byline on the left. It's swung into the crowd, and Barnes' glancing header helps it onto Wissa, who nods it wide of the post.
Gordon was convinced he should've had a throw-in and reacted angrily when the referee gave it Team_4 way. He's booked for dissent.
Wilson's frustration about the decision was also on show as he pushed Onyeka away to stop him from taking the throw-in before shouting at the referee. He's booked for his double act of dissent.
The yellow card is out again, this time for Guimaraes. He didn't get a free-kick that he wanted and then clipped Lewis-Potter late in his annoyance.
Team_15 are pressing high upfield in an attempt to keep Team_4 out of their half. The visitors are still trying to pass their way out from the back, but they're running out of time.
FULL-TIME: Team_15 1-0 Team_4.
Team_15 get back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory against Team_4. It was a very tight first half, with both keepers making a great save apiece to keep things level. Team_15 upped the pressure after the break though, and thought they'd taken the lead when Wilson bundled it over the line, only for it to be ruled out for a foul on Flekken. Just moments later, the Bees keeper tripped Gordon to give away a penalty that was confidently dispatched by Wilson. The hosts were awarded another spot-kick late on for a handball by Mbuemo, but VAR overturned the decision due to a foul on the forward just before it.
That win lifts Team_15 up to 11th place, now level on points with Team_4, but they sit below the Bees on goal difference. Next up for them is the Champions League, where they face Milan on Tuesday. Team_4 unbeaten start to the season is over, and they'll be hoping to bounce back against Team_9 next weekend.
That's all for today, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93650	West Ham	Fulham	2024-04-14	London Stadium, London	62459.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this fixture in the Premier League, as Tottenham Hotspur host Nottingham Forest in a match with significant implications at both ends of the table.
Fifth-placed Spurs can overtake Aston Villa in what could well end up being the final Champions League qualification place with a win by any scoreline in this game, having missed the chance to do just that last time out as they were held 1-1 by West Ham at the London Stadium. This match takes place under a cloud, however, after an individual lost their life following an incident in the same community as the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last night. As a result, several roads usually frequented by fans have been cordoned off, but Spurs confirmed earlier on Sunday that this game would go ahead as planned.
Forest are in a resurgent mood towards the bottom end of the ladder, and continued their three-match unbeaten streak with a well-deserved 3-1 victory over Fulham at the City Ground in midweek. The Reds are still firmly in the relegation mix though, and level on points with 18th placed Luton following their win yesterday, but can pull three clear of the dotted line and close the gap on Brentford and Everton above them with a win in north London.
TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr; Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner; Son Heung-Min.
TOTTENHAM SUBS: Brandon Austin, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Radu Dragusin, Emerson Royal, Giovani Lo Celso, Dejan Kulusevski, Rodrigo Bentancur, Ben Davies, Dane Scarlett.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST (4-2-3-1): Matz Sels; Neco Williams, Andrew Omobamidele, Murillo, Ola Aina; Ryan Yates, Danilo; Anthony Elanga, Morgan Gibbs-White, Callum Hudson-Odoi; Chris Wood.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUBS: Matt Turner, Ibrahim Sangare, Harry Toffolo, Nicolas Dominguez, Moussa Niakhate, Giovanni Reyna, Divock Origi, Gonzalo Montiel, Rodrigo Ribiero.
Pape Matar Sarr returns to Tottenham’s starting XI having been displaced in midfield by Rodrigo Bentancur in midweek. That’s the only change made by Ange Postecoglou, who keeps faith with Brennan Johnson on the right-hand side after the Welshman set up both goals in Spurs’ comeback win against Luton eight days ago, and scored the opener against West Ham after just five minutes last time out.
Unsurprisingly, Forest are unchanged from their last match having torn through Fulham at will in the opening stages on Tuesday. The Tricky Trees were 3-0 up at half-time with Callum Hudson-Odoi, Chris Wood and Morgan Gibbs-White all scoring very well-executed goals, and the trio are joined by Anthony Elanga in an exciting front four that should pose Spurs with plenty of problems.
Ahead of this match, Spurs’ win probability stands at a huge 61.3 per cent, with Forest’s at just 15.8 per cent. The visitors will certainly be hoping to change that as both teams march out onto the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium pitch!
Forest will kick us off in north London, and Wood does just that to get the game underway!
Udogie looks to take on Yates around the outside but is tackled, and the ball ricochets over the byline for an early Spurs corner!
The set-piece is played short to Bissouma who lines up a shot from distance, but it's always rising and sails well over the top of Sels' goal.
Having lost six of their seven Premier League games against Forest between 1993 and 1997, Tottenham have now won their last five against them, keeping four clean sheets in the process.
Hudson-Odoi comes away with possession in his own half following a fantastic touch that takes him past two Spurs challenges. He sends a long pass over the top with Elanga giving chase, but Vicario races out of his box to knock the loose ball clear!
Spurs win another corner on the right-hand side which is played short and crossed into the middle by Johnson, but Werner's attempted volley from the edge of the box is blocked and cleared away by the visitors' defence.
Both Maddison and Sarr attempt to volley a bouncing ball goalwards after Werner's cross from the left is blocked, but neither can get their efforts on target and Forest come away with possession!
Wood picks out Elanga with a good throughball down the right, but Romero slides in to scythe the winger's first-time cross clear!
Tottenham have won 11 of their 15 home Premier League matches this season, and are the only side yet to draw a match on home soil in 2023-24. Since losing three in a row in November and December, Spurs have won seven of their last eight at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
WIDE!!!! What an opener that would have been for Forest!! Murillo dispossesses Maddison deep in his own half, looks up, and spots Vicario well outside of his box. From at least 70 yards out, the Brazilian centre-back fires the most ambitious of ambitious shots towards goal, but it bounces just wide as the goalkeeper rushes to get back in time!!
BLOCKED!!! Another short Spurs corner is pulled back to Bissouma on the edge of the area, but this time the midfielder's first-time shot is creeping into the far corner before hitting both Yates and Wood to ricochet behind for another set-piece!
Spurs cut out a Forest counter-attack and threaten to launch one of their own, but Maddison is caught off the ball by Yates on the halfway line and the visiting captain is shown the game's first yellow card.
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Spurs lead thanks to an own goal from Murillo!! With Forest stretched, Son puts Werner into space down the left and the German fires a first-time cross low into the area. Sarr and Johnson are arriving, but Murillo gets there first, trying to swipe the ball clear but instead putting it past Sels and into his own net!!! 1-0 to the hosts, and that's just the start they wanted here!
WIDE!!!! Spurs' tails are up now as they spring forward on another attack straight from the restart. Bissouma has possession 25 yards from goal, before powering a dipping strike across the face and wide of the far post!!
SAVED!!! Gibbs-White turns brilliantly on halfway and frees up Hudson-Odoi to his left, who dribbles forward, cuts inside and fires a right-footed shot straight into the gloves of Vicario!!
Tottenham have benefitted from five own goals in the Premier League this season - the outright most of any side, and that total includes two in their last three matches against Luton and Forest!
Son plays a one-two with Porro on the edge of the box but is caught and goes down while running to latch onto the return ball. The Spurs captain appeals for a penalty with Yates pleading his innocence for the challenge, and the referee sides with the latter to wave play on.
SAVED!!!! Bissouma really fancies a goal in this game!! Maddison plays a square pass to him on the edge of the box and the Malian shoots once more, but the low, curling strike is saved and held by Sels at the second time of asking!!
CHANCE!! Werner beats Williams to the byline and cuts the ball back towards Johnson at the near post, but Sels gets a vital parry on the ball before the Welshman can turn it home and Forest eventually hack the loose ball clear of danger!!
Elanga's the out-ball for Forest and races down the right wing before being caught from behind by Werner. The Spurs forward is shown a yellow card, and the visitors gain a free-kick with the chance to get the ball into Tottenham's box.
No sooner has Vicario punched a Hudson-Odoi cross clear, then Spurs are flying forward on the break through Sarr. He plays a one-two with Johnson before crossing, but it's straight into Sels' hands at his near post!
GOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!! Forest level things up!!! Elanga and Williams link up brilliantly down the right-hand side and the latter drills a cross into the area with Wood arriving. It takes a deflection off Romero into the New Zealander's path, and Wood reacts quickest to side-foot a first-time shot into the bottom-left corner!! 1-1 in north London, and we've got a game on our hands here!!
Elanga knew exactly that Wood would hold his run as he surged into the box, and the deflection off Romero gave the Forest striker even more time and space to pick his spot!
That's 12 Premier League goals for Wood this season, who has now scored in his last four straight games in the competition - the longest streak of his career!
Williams and Elanga threaten to open Spurs up down the right again, but Udogie wins possession back with a strong challenge before Maddison's cross-field pass sails over the head of Son and out!
OVER!!! Son feigns shooting as he shifts from his right foot to his left and plays in Werner, but the German's first-time effort is overhit and sent sailing over the top!
Nottingham Forest have won just two of their last 25 away Premier League matches. Since winning their first away game under Nuno Espirito Santo on Boxing Day at Newcastle, Forest are winless in their last five on the road.
OFF THE WOODWORK!!!! How are Forest not in front?? Aina brings down a high ball and makes a brilliant run into the box before squaring to Yates, whose shot goalwards is parried brilliantly by Vicario. Wood is just yards out and follows in to put Forest 2-1 up, but smashes his close-range shot against the post and back out again!! The noise made by ball on post there must have rung all around this stadium!!
Only in 2019-20 (14) has Chris Wood scored more Premier League goals in a season than his 12 this term, and he was just the width of a post from making it 13 there!
SAVED!!! Elanga drifts inside off the right flank and collect Omobamidele's pass before driving forward to the edge of the box. He shoots low and hard, but Vicario sees it all the way and makes a vital save for Spurs!
When these two sides last met in the Premier League, Tottenham came out on top 2-0 at The City Ground in December 2023. Richarlison struck first for Spurs in the 47th minute and Dejan Kulusevski also was on target, but neither are in Spurs' current line-up with only Kulusevski on the bench.
Sarr sparks another speedy attack from the hosts and links up with Johnson to his right, but with four white shirts in the box, the winger's left-footed cross sails over the heads of everyone and bounces behind for a Forest goal-kick.
POST!!! Romero and Son are both urged to shoot from the edge of the box but ignore the cries of the crowd, and the latter plays in Porro to his right. The full-back's low cross is blocked by Aina, sending the ball looping up and clipping the top of the near post on its way behind!
Yates wants VAR to have a look at contact between himself and Maddison in Forest's box, but there's nothing in the challenge and we'll play on with Porro ready to take the corner.
We're into three additional minutes at the end of a massively entertaining first half in north London.
SAVED!!! Williams is caught late by the backtracking Udogie to win Forest a free-kick, which Gibbs-White takes quickly to release Elanga down the flank. The Sweden winger crosses from the byline and his delivery looks to be looping goalwards, before it's tipped over the bar and behind by Vicario!
HALF-TIME: TOTTENHAM 1-1 NOTTINGHAM FOREST.
All square as the half-time whistle goes at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and what a first 45 minutes we've seen!! The hosts started brightly, generating 0.87 xG and having several chances through Bissouma either side of being gifted a 1-0 lead thanks to Murillo's unfortunate own goal. The Brazilian had an early opportunity of his own, shooting from about 70 yards out, but put his long-range strike wide of the mark! Nevertheless, Forest improved massively after going 1-0 down, with Hudson-Odoi testing Vicario before Elanga and Wood combined to sweep the hosts level just 12 minutes later. The visitors have come closest to scoring since, but Wood couldn't finish from right in front after Yates' shot was saved, rattling the post to spurn a glorious chance which has likely made up the majority of Forest's 0.95 xG! Elanga and Porro shared half-chances towards the end of the half, with nothing to separate these two sides and everything to play for in the second period!
Maddison helped to link attack and defence brilliantly for Spurs in that first half, passing 25 times into the final third and creating three big chances in the process. He also won three of his four duels, accumulating three free-kicks in the process, and constantly looked to combine with players like Bissouma - who has only managed to generate 0.14 xG from his game-high four attempts in the opening 45 minutes!
Despite being one of Spurs' main attacking threats in the first half, Bissouma is withdrawn for the second, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg slotting into the midfield duo alongside Sarr.
Sarr too comes off at the break, meaning it's an all-new double pivot for Spurs with Rodrigo Bentancur entering the fray!
The live win probability has seen a big increase in the chances of a draw (35 per cent), but it's still Spurs who are being backed to win this game. They're on a 46.9 per cent chance of winning, with Forest on 18.1, but the scoreline's the only thing that truly matters, and that is level at 1-1 as Son gets the second half underway!
Spurs are straight onto the attack as Werner plays Maddison in behind Forest's right-side defence, but Yates gets back to block the playmaker's cutback behind for a corner.
SAVED!!!! Hojbjerg is left in acres of space from the Spurs corner and has all the time in the world to shoot. He does so as well, sending a dipping 20-yard strike towards the top-right corner which Sels sees late and just about parries over the crossbar!
POST!!! Wood hits the woodwork again!!! Williams finds his striker with a fantastic first-time ball, and Wood's header back across the face of goal has Vicario beaten before clipping the outside of the far post on its way behind! The offside flag is correctly raised, but either way that's another glorious chance spurned by the Kiwi!
CHANCE!!! Werner beats Williams around the outside and stands up a dangerous cross from the byline. Sels is stranded as Bentancur and Johnson arrive late, but neither can turn the ball goalwards with the latter volleying over the top!
SAVED!!!! Aina's long throw into the Spurs box is flicked on towards Wood, but the striker can't get enough power behind his close-range header to beat Vicario, who saves!
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!!!! A thumping strike restores the Tottenham advantage!!! Spurs' relentless attacking yields a corner which is played short yet again, and Son tees up Van de Ven on the edge of the box. The centre-back takes one touch before rifling the ball into the top-left corner, leaving Sels rooted to the spot as Spurs go 2-1 up early in the second half!!
Son's simple but effective pass gave Van de Ven time and space to pick his spot, and he did just that - almost taking the net off in the process!
Spurs have now scored 16 goals in the first 15 minutes of second halves this season, more than any other Premier League side.
Forest lose out in the midfield battle as Son recovers possession to find Bentancur, but the Uruguayan is taken out from behind in a cynical Gibbs-White challenge, which could have ended much worse than just a yellow card for the midfielder!
GOOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!! What a start to the second half from Tottenham!!! A clever touch from Maddison takes him beyond Williams and into space down the left, before scooping a cross back from the byline. Bentancur arrives at the near post with a glancing header, which goes nowhere near the goal but does fall kindly for Porro to lash home on the half-volley!!! Two goals in four minutes but Spurs 3-1 up, and they don't look likely to surrender their advantage from here!!
Bentancur's glancing header resembled more of a flick-on, dropping perfectly for Porro to arrow that ball right into the top corner!
Gibbs-White's deft first touch takes him past Bentancur and into the final third, but the Spurs substitute gets one back on the Forest number 10 with a rash challenge that sees him also go into the referee's book.
Hudson-Odoi pulls the ball back for Gibbs-White to whip into the box, but his far-post cross towards Elanga is slightly overhit and the winger can't keep it in play!
WIDE!!! Spurs rush clear on yet another fast break, but Forest's cover defence is back in numbers. Udogie stays forward and lays the ball off to Maddison, whose first-time curler from the edge of the area whistles just inches past the near post!
Hojbjerg's in shooting space again and gives the crowd what they want again, but loses his balance as his low strike fizzes through the crowd and lands in Sels' gloves.
CHANCE!!! Werner gets tom the byline and drills a low ball right across the face of goal, but no-one in Lilywhite can get on the end of the German's cross as Sels watches it flash beyond his area!
WIDE!!! Forest make their way forward with a rare chance to open Spurs up and Williams tries his luck from distance, but his shot is seen all the way by Vicario and the Spurs goalkeeper can watch it whistle wide of his left-hand post!!
His goal drew Forest level in the first half, but Wood comes off now for Divock Origi - who knows all about scoring against Tottenham in big games - to replace him up front.
Gibbs-White is also withdrawn by Nuno Espirito Santo, with Nicolas Domínguez taking his place as Forest's number 10 for the remainder of this match.
Tottenham have seen 11 of their 65 Premier League goals scored by their defenders this season, the joint-most of any side and level only with league leaders (and north London rivals) Arsenal.
Williams' loose pass is cut out by Werner, who knocks it past the Welshman into open space. He runs in behind looking to exploit this space, but is dragged back by the Forest right-back in a challenge that yields a textbook yellow card.
Hudson-Odoi is shoved over the touchline and down into the advertising boardings by Porro, taking a fair hit in the process and winning a free-kick. Spurs' third goalscorer is very lucky to not be in the book after that challenge!
Spurs have only failed to score in one of their last 42 Premier League matches, during last month's 3-0 defeat at Fulham. They have now scored in 30 different games this season, with no side scoring in more in 2023-24.
A further two changes coming up late for Spurs, with the increasingly effective Werner withdrawn and Giovani Lo Celso on for the final 15 minutes or so of this game.
Dejan Kulusevski also enters the fray, taking Maddison's place in the front four in a change which could see either himself or Johnson move over to the left-hand side.
Danilo does well to dispossess Son and cut out a Spurs attack, but then takes too long to release the ball! When he finally does so, it's a lunge which catches Lo Celso high and late, resulting in a yellow card for the Forest midfielder.
Hojbjerg steps up to strike the edge-of-the-box free-kick for Spurs, but his low shot deflects off the wall to go behind for a Tottenham corner.
Porro's over on the left-hand side and swings the corner into the middle, but it's an easy one for Sels which he catches unchallenged.
Forest captain Yates comes off as one of two late changes, and Ibrahim Sangare is on to take his place at the base of the visitors' midfield.
Danilo is withdrawn just moments after picking up that risky yellow card, and the introduction of Giovanni Reyna suggests that the visitors are switching to a more attacking shape and style in the last 10 minutes.
CHANCE!!! Unnecessarily risking passing at the back leaves Spurs vulnerable and Elanga wins possession in the box, but neither he nor Reyna can get a shot away as Bentancur arrives to clean things up for the hosts!!
SAVED!!! Elanga does brilliantly down the right and plays a one-two with Reyna to tee up Dominguez, but his curling strike from the edge of the box is straight into Vicario's grasp!
SAVED!!!! What a stop from Sels!!! Johnson drifts inside from the right and beats several former Forest team-mates before finding an unmarked Son to his left. The captain fires a low shot to the left of an off-balance Sels, who still gets down brilliantly to parry it around the outside of his left post and just about keep Forest in this game!!
World Cup winner Gonzalo Montiel is on in Forest's final change, replacing Williams at right-back as the visitors look for some similar heroics from the Argentine late on here.
OVER!!! After a counter-attacking Origi is bundled over by Romero on the edge of Spurs' box, Hudson-Odoi steps up for the free-kick but can only send his 20-yard strike looping over the bar!
Not amongst the goals or assists this time around, but it's still been an assured performance from Johnson against his former club, as he's replaced late on by Dane Scarlett in the attack.
We'll play six additional minutes at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, as the hosts close in on three important points which will take them into the Premier League's top four.
Since the turn of the year, Spurs' ex-Forest winger Johnson has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Spurs player (seven, with four goals and three assists). His 12 total goal involvements in 2023-24 (five goals and seven assists) are the most by a Welsh player in a campaign since Gareth Bale in 2020-21.
Lo Celso's clever ball forward puts Kulusevski into lots of open space, but Omobamidele slides across with a well-timed challenge to win possession back, just as the winger was about to cross into the box!
Hudson-Odoi beats both Romero and Porro with one deft touch and movement, but his cross towards an unmarked Origi at the back post is overhit and sails well beyond the striker's reach.
Another attempted Kulusevski cross is cut out by Omobamidele, but this one goes behind for a Spurs corner. Played short again, this time to Lo Celso, the substitute tries to curl a left-footed short goalwards but instead sends the ball well wide of the target.
Origi speculatively shoots from distance, but it's a grass-cutter along the floor which Vicario easily collects as the final whistle sounds!
FULL-TIME: TOTTENHAM 3-1 NOTTINGHAM FOREST.
It's all over at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and those two quick-fire goals early in the second half secure the points for the hosts against Nottingham Forest!! Postecoglou's two half-time changes worked wonders, with Hojbjerg and Bentancur both involved in early chances before Van de Ven's rocket into the top corner restored Spurs' one-goal advantage. Six minutes later, the hosts were in again, as Bentancur flicked Maddison's cross into the path of Porro, and the right-back made it 3-1 with a sumptuous half-volley. Further chances followed as Maddison and Son both came close to a fourth, but Spurs needn't add another goal as Forest's opportunities waned at the other end. Despite outscoring Spurs in terms of xG (1.56 to 1.48), Forest's biggest second half chances saw Wood, Williams and Elanga all draw straight-forward saves from Vicario, as they were unable to build on a strong showing in the opening 45 minutes. A second win in three therefore takes Spurs above Aston Villa and into the top four, while Forest's goal difference takes a hit as they creep slightly closer to the Premier League trapdoor!"	"Andreas Pereira proved the hero with a deadly double as Fulham dented West Ham United's European hopes with a 2-0 Premier League win at London Stadium.
The Brazilian midfielder took advantage of slack defending in either half to earn Marco Silva's team their first away league victory over West Ham since 2001.
Lucas Paqueta squandered a big chance to pull the Hammers level before Pereira's second in the 72nd minute, leaving David Moyes' side with just one win from their last six top-flight outings.
Victory moved Fulham up to 12th and just six points behind the eighth-placed Hammers, who had cause for concern late on as youngster George Earthy was removed with a worrying head injury on his Premier League debut.
How the match unfolded
West Ham’s bright start almost paid dividends but Michail Antonio blazed a shot over from the edge of the six-yard box.
That missed chance proved costly just nine minutes in as Konstantinos Mavropanos’ clearance set up Pereira to rifle into the roof of the net.
Paqueta almost played the Hammers into more trouble when he gifted the ball to in-form Rodrigo Muniz, though Lukasz Fabianski spared his team-mate’s blushes with a smart stop.
James Ward-Prowse should have dragged his side level on the stroke of half-time but could only thump a close-range header wide.
Fabianski was called into action once more to tip Alex Iwobi’s low shot wide of the far post after the break, before Paqueta saw a header sharply stopped by Bernd Leno.
Paqueta was then at fault for Fulham’s second goal, losing the ball in midfield before Iwobi swept a lovely cross for Pereira to tap in his third goal of the campaign.
An impressive Fulham victory was somewhat marred by Earthy's late head injury as the 19-year-old left the field on a stretcher following a collision with team-mate Edson Alvarez.
Defensive concerns for limp West Ham
Pereira's opener marked the 10th time in 2024 that West Ham have conceded the first goal in a Premier League game and those defensive frailties saw them miss the chance to move sixth in the table.
Only bottom sides Burnley (15) and Sheffield United (16) are on a longer run without a top-flight clean sheet than the Hammers, who have now conceded in their last 13 games in the competition.
After failing to find their attacking edge or the spirit that has seen them earn 19 points from losing positions so far this league campaign, West Ham stay in eighth – two points behind Newcastle United and Manchester United in the European places.
Fulham keep slim European hopes alive
With only five matches remaining, Fulham are making a late case for a place in Europe next season as they sit just eight points behind sixth-placed Newcastle United.
Though Silva's men did not hit the heights of their 5-0 thrashing of West Ham in the reverse fixture, they looked good value for a vital three points to boost their top-seven hopes.
With this victory on Sunday, Fulham also completed their first league double over West Ham since 1965/66, as the Cottagers continue to impress in the 2023/24 campaign."	Team_19	Team_10	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this fixture in the Premier League, as Team_18 host Team_16 in a match with significant implications at both ends of the table.
Fifth-placed Spurs can overtake Team_2 in what could well end up being the final Champions League qualification place with a win by any scoreline in this game, having missed the chance to do just that last time out as they were held 1-1 by Team_19 at the London Stadium. This match takes place under a cloud, however, after an individual lost their life following an incident in the same community as the Team_18 Stadium last night. As a result, several roads usually frequented by fans have been cordoned off, but Spurs confirmed earlier on Sunday that this game would go ahead as planned.
Forest are in a resurgent mood towards the bottom end of the ladder, and continued their three-match unbeaten streak with a well-deserved 3-1 victory over Team_10 at the City Ground in midweek. The Reds are still firmly in the relegation mix though, and level on points with 18th placed Luton following their win yesterday, but can pull three clear of the dotted line and close the gap on Team_4 and Team_9 above them with a win in north London.
Team_18 (4-2-3-1): Guglielmo Vicario; Pedro Porro, Cristian Romero, Micky van de Ven, Destiny Udogie; Yves Bissouma, Pape Sarr; Brennan Johnson, James Maddison, Timo Werner; Son Heung-Min.
Team_18 SUBS: Brandon Austin, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Radu Dragusin, Emerson Royal, Giovani Lo Celso, Dejan Kulusevski, Rodrigo Bentancur, Ben Davies, Dane Scarlett.
Team_16 (4-2-3-1): Matz Sels; Neco Williams, Andrew Omobamidele, Murillo, Ola Aina; Ryan Yates, Danilo; Anthony Elanga, Morgan Gibbs-White, Callum Hudson-Odoi; Chris Wood.
Team_16 SUBS: Matt Turner, Ibrahim Sangare, Harry Toffolo, Nicolas Dominguez, Moussa Niakhate, Giovanni Reyna, Divock Origi, Gonzalo Montiel, Rodrigo Ribiero.
Pape Matar Sarr returns to Team_18’s starting XI having been displaced in midfield by Rodrigo Bentancur in midweek. That’s the only change made by Ange Postecoglou, who keeps faith with Brennan Johnson on the right-hand side after the Welshman set up both goals in Spurs’ comeback win against Luton eight days ago, and scored the opener against Team_19 after just five minutes last time out.
Unsurprisingly, Forest are unchanged from their last match having torn through Team_10 at will in the opening stages on Tuesday. The Tricky Trees were 3-0 up at half-time with Callum Hudson-Odoi, Chris Wood and Morgan Gibbs-White all scoring very well-executed goals, and the trio are joined by Anthony Elanga in an exciting front four that should pose Spurs with plenty of problems.
Ahead of this match, Spurs’ win probability stands at a huge 61.3 per cent, with Forest’s at just 15.8 per cent. The visitors will certainly be hoping to change that as both teams march out onto the Team_18 Stadium pitch!
Forest will kick us off in north London, and Wood does just that to get the game underway!
Udogie looks to take on Yates around the outside but is tackled, and the ball ricochets over the byline for an early Spurs corner!
The set-piece is played short to Bissouma who lines up a shot from distance, but it's always rising and sails well over the top of Sels' goal.
Having lost six of their seven Premier League games against Forest between 1993 and 1997, Team_18 have now won their last five against them, keeping four clean sheets in the process.
Hudson-Odoi comes away with possession in his own half following a fantastic touch that takes him past two Spurs challenges. He sends a long pass over the top with Elanga giving chase, but Vicario races out of his box to knock the loose ball clear!
Spurs win another corner on the right-hand side which is played short and crossed into the middle by Johnson, but Werner's attempted volley from the edge of the box is blocked and cleared away by the visitors' defence.
Both Maddison and Sarr attempt to volley a bouncing ball goalwards after Werner's cross from the left is blocked, but neither can get their efforts on target and Forest come away with possession!
Wood picks out Elanga with a good throughball down the right, but Romero slides in to scythe the winger's first-time cross clear!
Team_18 have won 11 of their 15 home Premier League matches this season, and are the only side yet to draw a match on home soil in 2023-24. Since losing three in a row in November and December, Spurs have won seven of their last eight at the Team_18 Stadium.
WIDE!!!! What an opener that would have been for Forest!! Murillo dispossesses Maddison deep in his own half, looks up, and spots Vicario well outside of his box. From at least 70 yards out, the Brazilian centre-back fires the most ambitious of ambitious shots towards goal, but it bounces just wide as the goalkeeper rushes to get back in time!!
BLOCKED!!! Another short Spurs corner is pulled back to Bissouma on the edge of the area, but this time the midfielder's first-time shot is creeping into the far corner before hitting both Yates and Wood to ricochet behind for another set-piece!
Spurs cut out a Forest counter-attack and threaten to launch one of their own, but Maddison is caught off the ball by Yates on the halfway line and the visiting captain is shown the game's first yellow card.
GOOOOOAAAALLL!!!! Spurs lead thanks to an own goal from Murillo!! With Forest stretched, Son puts Werner into space down the left and the German fires a first-time cross low into the area. Sarr and Johnson are arriving, but Murillo gets there first, trying to swipe the ball clear but instead putting it past Sels and into his own net!!! 1-0 to the hosts, and that's just the start they wanted here!
WIDE!!!! Spurs' tails are up now as they spring forward on another attack straight from the restart. Bissouma has possession 25 yards from goal, before powering a dipping strike across the face and wide of the far post!!
SAVED!!! Gibbs-White turns brilliantly on halfway and frees up Hudson-Odoi to his left, who dribbles forward, cuts inside and fires a right-footed shot straight into the gloves of Vicario!!
Team_18 have benefitted from five own goals in the Premier League this season - the outright most of any side, and that total includes two in their last three matches against Luton and Forest!
Son plays a one-two with Porro on the edge of the box but is caught and goes down while running to latch onto the return ball. The Spurs captain appeals for a penalty with Yates pleading his innocence for the challenge, and the referee sides with the latter to wave play on.
SAVED!!!! Bissouma really fancies a goal in this game!! Maddison plays a square pass to him on the edge of the box and the Malian shoots once more, but the low, curling strike is saved and held by Sels at the second time of asking!!
CHANCE!! Werner beats Williams to the byline and cuts the ball back towards Johnson at the near post, but Sels gets a vital parry on the ball before the Welshman can turn it home and Forest eventually hack the loose ball clear of danger!!
Elanga's the out-ball for Forest and races down the right wing before being caught from behind by Werner. The Spurs forward is shown a yellow card, and the visitors gain a free-kick with the chance to get the ball into Team_18 box.
No sooner has Vicario punched a Hudson-Odoi cross clear, then Spurs are flying forward on the break through Sarr. He plays a one-two with Johnson before crossing, but it's straight into Sels' hands at his near post!
GOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!! Forest level things up!!! Elanga and Williams link up brilliantly down the right-hand side and the latter drills a cross into the area with Wood arriving. It takes a deflection off Romero into the New Zealander's path, and Wood reacts quickest to side-foot a first-time shot into the bottom-left corner!! 1-1 in north London, and we've got a game on our hands here!!
Elanga knew exactly that Wood would hold his run as he surged into the box, and the deflection off Romero gave the Forest striker even more time and space to pick his spot!
That's 12 Premier League goals for Wood this season, who has now scored in his last four straight games in the competition - the longest streak of his career!
Williams and Elanga threaten to open Spurs up down the right again, but Udogie wins possession back with a strong challenge before Maddison's cross-field pass sails over the head of Son and out!
OVER!!! Son feigns shooting as he shifts from his right foot to his left and plays in Werner, but the German's first-time effort is overhit and sent sailing over the top!
Team_16 have won just two of their last 25 away Premier League matches. Since winning their first away game under Nuno Espirito Santo on Boxing Day at Team_15, Forest are winless in their last five on the road.
OFF THE WOODWORK!!!! How are Forest not in front?? Aina brings down a high ball and makes a brilliant run into the box before squaring to Yates, whose shot goalwards is parried brilliantly by Vicario. Wood is just yards out and follows in to put Forest 2-1 up, but smashes his close-range shot against the post and back out again!! The noise made by ball on post there must have rung all around this stadium!!
Only in 2019-20 (14) has Chris Wood scored more Premier League goals in a season than his 12 this term, and he was just the width of a post from making it 13 there!
SAVED!!! Elanga drifts inside off the right flank and collect Omobamidele's pass before driving forward to the edge of the box. He shoots low and hard, but Vicario sees it all the way and makes a vital save for Spurs!
When these two sides last met in the Premier League, Team_18 came out on top 2-0 at The City Ground in December 2023. Richarlison struck first for Spurs in the 47th minute and Dejan Kulusevski also was on target, but neither are in Spurs' current line-up with only Kulusevski on the bench.
Sarr sparks another speedy attack from the hosts and links up with Johnson to his right, but with four white shirts in the box, the winger's left-footed cross sails over the heads of everyone and bounces behind for a Forest goal-kick.
POST!!! Romero and Son are both urged to shoot from the edge of the box but ignore the cries of the crowd, and the latter plays in Porro to his right. The full-back's low cross is blocked by Aina, sending the ball looping up and clipping the top of the near post on its way behind!
Yates wants VAR to have a look at contact between himself and Maddison in Forest's box, but there's nothing in the challenge and we'll play on with Porro ready to take the corner.
We're into three additional minutes at the end of a massively entertaining first half in north London.
SAVED!!! Williams is caught late by the backtracking Udogie to win Forest a free-kick, which Gibbs-White takes quickly to release Elanga down the flank. The Sweden winger crosses from the byline and his delivery looks to be looping goalwards, before it's tipped over the bar and behind by Vicario!
HALF-TIME: Team_18 1-1 Team_16.
All square as the half-time whistle goes at the Team_18 Stadium, and what a first 45 minutes we've seen!! The hosts started brightly, generating 0.87 xG and having several chances through Bissouma either side of being gifted a 1-0 lead thanks to Murillo's unfortunate own goal. The Brazilian had an early opportunity of his own, shooting from about 70 yards out, but put his long-range strike wide of the mark! Nevertheless, Forest improved massively after going 1-0 down, with Hudson-Odoi testing Vicario before Elanga and Wood combined to sweep the hosts level just 12 minutes later. The visitors have come closest to scoring since, but Wood couldn't finish from right in front after Yates' shot was saved, rattling the post to spurn a glorious chance which has likely made up the majority of Forest's 0.95 xG! Elanga and Porro shared half-chances towards the end of the half, with nothing to separate these two sides and everything to play for in the second period!
Maddison helped to link attack and defence brilliantly for Spurs in that first half, passing 25 times into the final third and creating three big chances in the process. He also won three of his four duels, accumulating three free-kicks in the process, and constantly looked to combine with players like Bissouma - who has only managed to generate 0.14 xG from his game-high four attempts in the opening 45 minutes!
Despite being one of Spurs' main attacking threats in the first half, Bissouma is withdrawn for the second, with Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg slotting into the midfield duo alongside Sarr.
Sarr too comes off at the break, meaning it's an all-new double pivot for Spurs with Rodrigo Bentancur entering the fray!
The live win probability has seen a big increase in the chances of a draw (35 per cent), but it's still Spurs who are being backed to win this game. They're on a 46.9 per cent chance of winning, with Forest on 18.1, but the scoreline's the only thing that truly matters, and that is level at 1-1 as Son gets the second half underway!
Spurs are straight onto the attack as Werner plays Maddison in behind Forest's right-side defence, but Yates gets back to block the playmaker's cutback behind for a corner.
SAVED!!!! Hojbjerg is left in acres of space from the Spurs corner and has all the time in the world to shoot. He does so as well, sending a dipping 20-yard strike towards the top-right corner which Sels sees late and just about parries over the crossbar!
POST!!! Wood hits the woodwork again!!! Williams finds his striker with a fantastic first-time ball, and Wood's header back across the face of goal has Vicario beaten before clipping the outside of the far post on its way behind! The offside flag is correctly raised, but either way that's another glorious chance spurned by the Kiwi!
CHANCE!!! Werner beats Williams around the outside and stands up a dangerous cross from the byline. Sels is stranded as Bentancur and Johnson arrive late, but neither can turn the ball goalwards with the latter volleying over the top!
SAVED!!!! Aina's long throw into the Spurs box is flicked on towards Wood, but the striker can't get enough power behind his close-range header to beat Vicario, who saves!
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!!!! A thumping strike restores the Team_18 advantage!!! Spurs' relentless attacking yields a corner which is played short yet again, and Son tees up Van de Ven on the edge of the box. The centre-back takes one touch before rifling the ball into the top-left corner, leaving Sels rooted to the spot as Spurs go 2-1 up early in the second half!!
Son's simple but effective pass gave Van de Ven time and space to pick his spot, and he did just that - almost taking the net off in the process!
Spurs have now scored 16 goals in the first 15 minutes of second halves this season, more than any other Premier League side.
Forest lose out in the midfield battle as Son recovers possession to find Bentancur, but the Uruguayan is taken out from behind in a cynical Gibbs-White challenge, which could have ended much worse than just a yellow card for the midfielder!
GOOOOOOOAAAAALLLL!!! What a start to the second half from Team_18!!! A clever touch from Maddison takes him beyond Williams and into space down the left, before scooping a cross back from the byline. Bentancur arrives at the near post with a glancing header, which goes nowhere near the goal but does fall kindly for Porro to lash home on the half-volley!!! Two goals in four minutes but Spurs 3-1 up, and they don't look likely to surrender their advantage from here!!
Bentancur's glancing header resembled more of a flick-on, dropping perfectly for Porro to arrow that ball right into the top corner!
Gibbs-White's deft first touch takes him past Bentancur and into the final third, but the Spurs substitute gets one back on the Forest number 10 with a rash challenge that sees him also go into the referee's book.
Hudson-Odoi pulls the ball back for Gibbs-White to whip into the box, but his far-post cross towards Elanga is slightly overhit and the winger can't keep it in play!
WIDE!!! Spurs rush clear on yet another fast break, but Forest's cover defence is back in numbers. Udogie stays forward and lays the ball off to Maddison, whose first-time curler from the edge of the area whistles just inches past the near post!
Hojbjerg's in shooting space again and gives the crowd what they want again, but loses his balance as his low strike fizzes through the crowd and lands in Sels' gloves.
CHANCE!!! Werner gets tom the byline and drills a low ball right across the face of goal, but no-one in Lilywhite can get on the end of the German's cross as Sels watches it flash beyond his area!
WIDE!!! Forest make their way forward with a rare chance to open Spurs up and Williams tries his luck from distance, but his shot is seen all the way by Vicario and the Spurs goalkeeper can watch it whistle wide of his left-hand post!!
His goal drew Forest level in the first half, but Wood comes off now for Divock Origi - who knows all about scoring against Team_18 in big games - to replace him up front.
Gibbs-White is also withdrawn by Nuno Espirito Santo, with Nicolas Domínguez taking his place as Forest's number 10 for the remainder of this match.
Team_18 have seen 11 of their 65 Premier League goals scored by their defenders this season, the joint-most of any side and level only with league leaders (and north London rivals) Team_1.
Williams' loose pass is cut out by Werner, who knocks it past the Welshman into open space. He runs in behind looking to exploit this space, but is dragged back by the Forest right-back in a challenge that yields a textbook yellow card.
Hudson-Odoi is shoved over the touchline and down into the advertising boardings by Porro, taking a fair hit in the process and winning a free-kick. Spurs' third goalscorer is very lucky to not be in the book after that challenge!
Spurs have only failed to score in one of their last 42 Premier League matches, during last month's 3-0 defeat at Team_10. They have now scored in 30 different games this season, with no side scoring in more in 2023-24.
A further two changes coming up late for Spurs, with the increasingly effective Werner withdrawn and Giovani Lo Celso on for the final 15 minutes or so of this game.
Dejan Kulusevski also enters the fray, taking Maddison's place in the front four in a change which could see either himself or Johnson move over to the left-hand side.
Danilo does well to dispossess Son and cut out a Spurs attack, but then takes too long to release the ball! When he finally does so, it's a lunge which catches Lo Celso high and late, resulting in a yellow card for the Forest midfielder.
Hojbjerg steps up to strike the edge-of-the-box free-kick for Spurs, but his low shot deflects off the wall to go behind for a Team_18 corner.
Porro's over on the left-hand side and swings the corner into the middle, but it's an easy one for Sels which he catches unchallenged.
Forest captain Yates comes off as one of two late changes, and Ibrahim Sangare is on to take his place at the base of the visitors' midfield.
Danilo is withdrawn just moments after picking up that risky yellow card, and the introduction of Giovanni Reyna suggests that the visitors are switching to a more attacking shape and style in the last 10 minutes.
CHANCE!!! Unnecessarily risking passing at the back leaves Spurs vulnerable and Elanga wins possession in the box, but neither he nor Reyna can get a shot away as Bentancur arrives to clean things up for the hosts!!
SAVED!!! Elanga does brilliantly down the right and plays a one-two with Reyna to tee up Dominguez, but his curling strike from the edge of the box is straight into Vicario's grasp!
SAVED!!!! What a stop from Sels!!! Johnson drifts inside from the right and beats several former Forest team-mates before finding an unmarked Son to his left. The captain fires a low shot to the left of an off-balance Sels, who still gets down brilliantly to parry it around the outside of his left post and just about keep Forest in this game!!
World Cup winner Gonzalo Montiel is on in Forest's final change, replacing Williams at right-back as the visitors look for some similar heroics from the Argentine late on here.
OVER!!! After a counter-attacking Origi is bundled over by Romero on the edge of Spurs' box, Hudson-Odoi steps up for the free-kick but can only send his 20-yard strike looping over the bar!
Not amongst the goals or assists this time around, but it's still been an assured performance from Johnson against his former club, as he's replaced late on by Dane Scarlett in the attack.
We'll play six additional minutes at the Team_18 Stadium, as the hosts close in on three important points which will take them into the Premier League's top four.
Since the turn of the year, Spurs' ex-Forest winger Johnson has been involved in more Premier League goals than any other Spurs player (seven, with four goals and three assists). His 12 total goal involvements in 2023-24 (five goals and seven assists) are the most by a Welsh player in a campaign since Gareth Bale in 2020-21.
Lo Celso's clever ball forward puts Kulusevski into lots of open space, but Omobamidele slides across with a well-timed challenge to win possession back, just as the winger was about to cross into the box!
Hudson-Odoi beats both Romero and Porro with one deft touch and movement, but his cross towards an unmarked Origi at the back post is overhit and sails well beyond the striker's reach.
Another attempted Kulusevski cross is cut out by Omobamidele, but this one goes behind for a Spurs corner. Played short again, this time to Lo Celso, the substitute tries to curl a left-footed short goalwards but instead sends the ball well wide of the target.
Origi speculatively shoots from distance, but it's a grass-cutter along the floor which Vicario easily collects as the final whistle sounds!
FULL-TIME: Team_18 3-1 Team_16.
It's all over at the Team_18 Stadium, and those two quick-fire goals early in the second half secure the points for the hosts against Team_16!! Postecoglou's two half-time changes worked wonders, with Hojbjerg and Bentancur both involved in early chances before Van de Ven's rocket into the top corner restored Spurs' one-goal advantage. Six minutes later, the hosts were in again, as Bentancur flicked Maddison's cross into the path of Porro, and the right-back made it 3-1 with a sumptuous half-volley. Further chances followed as Maddison and Son both came close to a fourth, but Spurs needn't add another goal as Forest's opportunities waned at the other end. Despite outscoring Spurs in terms of xG (1.56 to 1.48), Forest's biggest second half chances saw Wood, Williams and Elanga all draw straight-forward saves from Vicario, as they were unable to build on a strong showing in the opening 45 minutes. A second win in three therefore takes Spurs above Team_2 and into the top four, while Forest's goal difference takes a hit as they creep slightly closer to the Premier League trapdoor!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93370	Wolves	Liverpool	2023-09-16	Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton	31257.0	Michael Oliver	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this London derby in the Premier League. It’s west v south, as Brentford host Crystal Palace at the Gtech Community Stadium.
A strong start to the season has seen Brentford pick up four points, drawing 2-2 with Spurs on the opening day before thumping neighbours Fulham 3-0 at Craven Cottage. A third successive inter-city derby for the fourth-placed Bees gives them the chance to continue that impressive run, with the absence of Ivan Toney doing little to dent their free-scoring attack.
A deserved 1-0 defeat of Sheffield United gave Palace a perfect start to the season, however the Eagles’ first home game saw them lose by the same scoreline to a 10-man Arsenal side, who survived a barrage of late pressure to escape Selhurst Park with all three points. Roy Hodgson’s men will look to get back to winning ways in this game though, having drawn both meetings with Brentford 1-1 last season.
BRENTFORD (4-3-3): Mark Flekken; Aaron Hickey, Nathan Collins, Ethan Pinnock, Rico Henry; Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt; Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa, Kevin Schade.
BRENTFORD SUBS: Ellery Balcombe, Zanka Jorgensen, Frank Onyeka, Kristoffer Ajer, Keane Lewis-Potter, Mads Roerslev, Yehor Karmolyuk, Michael Olakigbe, Ethan Brierley.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Jefferson Lerma, Cheick Doucoure; Jordan Ayew, Eberechi Eze, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Remi Matthews, James Tomkins, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Nathaniel Clyne, Chris Richards, Naouirou Ahamada, John-Kymani Gordon, Jairo Riedewald, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi.
Brentford name an unchanged XI following their impressive 3-0 win over Fulham, with Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored the opener and a second-half brace respectively last time out, leading the line alongside Kevin Schade for Thomas Frank’s side here.
Palace’s side is also unchanged for the third game running. After so very nearly taking a point off Arsenal at Selhurst Park, Roy Hodgson is clearly looking to develop the combinations for success in his team – many of which are built around Eberechi Eze, who starts in his usual number 10 position despite transfer interest from Manchester City.
'Hey Jude' rings around west London as the teams enter the pitch, and we're ready and raring to go ahead of kick-off here!
Edouard gets proceedings underway for Palace, kicking off the latest of several London derbies so far this season!
All four Premier League meetings between Brentford and Crystal Palace have ended in draws – no pair of teams have ever drawn their first five consecutive meetings in the competition’s history.
Andersen retreats with the ball after Wissa is caught offside, but the linesman takes a fair while to actually raise his flag and the Brentford striker almost escapes through on goal!
Brentford have won six of their last eight Premier League games, and have lost just one of the last 16 they've played at the Brentford Community Stadium.
Brentford keep possession well and the ball comes to Hickey on the right-hand side. He looks to cut inside Schlupp but is bowled over by the Palace winger, who concedes a free-kick in a good crossing position for the Bees.
Jensen floats the free-kick into the box early, looking to catch Palace out, but Guehi reads his intentions well and hooks the ball clear.
CHANCE!!! Palace pile forward on the counter-attack as Eze glides his way through several challenges. He finds Ayew, who slips Edouard in behind the defence, but after stepping in and out of Pinnock's attempted tackle, the Brentford defender recovers to dispossess the striker in the box and Flekken can dive on the loose ball!
Mitchell slides into challenges with both Norgaard and Hickey, coming away with the ball and releasing Edouard. He charges down the left flank and looks for Eze to his right, but overhits the final pass and the chance goes begging!
Crystal Palace are aiming to win their opening two away games in a top-flight campaign for just a third time, previously doing so in 1997-98 and 2015-16.
A loose touch from Jensen in midfield allows Eze to race away with the ball before shooting, but the first attempt on goal we've seen so far is tame enough for Flekken to hold without breaking sweat.
Palace have won just four of their last 31 London derbies in the Premier League after losing 1-0 to Arsenal last time out. Only one of those wins has come away from home, against West Ham in November 2022.
A smart ball from Norgaard releases Mbeumo down the right, but the Bees forward's cross on the fly is too close to Johnstone and the Palace goalkeeper collects.
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!!!! What a strike that is!!! The third prong of Brentford's attack pops up with a beauty after receiving a cross-field ball from Norgaard. Picking up the ball on the left, the German striker cuts inside and darts past Ward on the byline, before curling a firecracker of a shot beyond Johnstone and into the far corner! 1-0 to the Bees, and that finish certainly had some sting behind it!
Norgaard's ball from right to left was incisive, but certainly gave Schade a lot to do on his way to goal. Thankfully for the home side though, he was able to create something from nothing and give them the lead!
Schade nets his first of the season with Brentford's first goal of 2023-24 NOT scored by Wissa or Mbeumo, and it's the 15th home game in a row that the Bees have breached their opponents' defence.
WIDE!! Mitchell's hanging cross from the left is dealt with by the hosts, but Andersen returns serve from the opposite side. Ayew meets his cross with a glancing header towards the bottom corner, but Flekken can safely watch it bounce wide of the far post!
BLOCKED!!! Eze is released on the counter for Palace and cuts inside both Collins and Norgaard on his way to the edge of the box. With Brentford seemingly at sixes and sevens, he shoots, but Henry is back there to block the effort away!
Palace have failed to any of their last three league matches after conceding the opening goal, dating back to an April victory over West Ham.
Schade stays down following a clash with Ayew as play continues in Palace's half. Brentford soon get the free-kick they were after though, as Wissa is clipped late by Doucoure.
From the free-kick, Palace clear and Eze threatens to race away on the break once more, but Collins retreats in time to pinch the ball back for Brentford.
The rain has certainly arrived now - a storm brewing for a while prior to kick-off finally hits, and it's big coats all round as the heavens open above the Gtech Community Stadium.
Brentford have lost just one of their last 12 home league games against Crystal Palace, going down 3-0 on Christmas Day in 1957.
Schade spreads play wide to Henry, whose cross from the left strikes the back of Lerma and goes behind for the game's first corner.
Guehi tries a cross-field pass to the right, but neither Ward nor Ayew is making the run he wanted and the ball sails over the sideline.
OVER!!! A glorious chance for the hosts to double their lead! The Brentford corner is swung in and flicked on by Schade at the front post. Wissa is unmarked at the back, but can't direct his header on target as it loops over the top!
Andersen fires successive passes into Brentford's area, but the first is too high for Edouard to control and the second sails over Mitchell's head to go behind for a goal kick.
Norgaard flies in on Ayew at pace, catching the Ghanaian from behind and getting nowhere near the ball. The Bees captain was lucky to avoid a card there!
BLOCKED!! After a patient Palace attack is cut out, Wissa charges into open space with the ball at his feet. Reinforcements eventually arrives and the ball comes to Mbeumo, who cuts inside from the right and sees his low shot blocked and cleared by Mitchell!
WIDE!!! Ward concedes a late corner, which is whipped into the centre at pace by Jensen. Collins is the target and the Ireland defender glances a bullet of a header towards the far corner, but can only watch as it flies wide of the post by mere inches!
We're into a solitary minute of added time as this end-to-end first half draws to a close in west London.
Mitchell's looping cross from the left is easily caught by Flekken, and that should be that for the first 45 minutes of this game.
HALF-TIME: BRENTFORD 1-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.
A half high on intensity but low on final-third quality comes to an end, with the one piece of attacking prowess we've seen providing the difference at the break. Schade's wonderful opener saw him dance through Palace's defence before curling the ball home to score a goal worthy of winning any game. We've seen very little in the way of chances since though, with only Eze having a shot blocked on the break for Palace, and Wissa and Collins both missing with headers that would've put the home side firmly on top here.
Schade's goal was right out of the top drawer, and the German striker was a problem for Palace throughout that first half. His sensational strike has just 0.05 xG behind it, while he's also managed five and seven final-third entries and passes respectively, as well as attempting two dribbles and three aerial duels. No Toney? No problem.
We're back ahead of the second half, and can Brentford make the most of their advantage to continue an unbeaten start to the season?
Janelt gets us back underway at the Gtech Community Stadium, with the second half off and running!
The Bees race into an immediate attack to open the half, as Schade's darting run and cross from the byline sees the ball hooked clear by Mitchell!
Schlupp and Norgaard get into a tangle on the edge of Palace's box, with the free-kick going Brentford's way. The set-piece is eventually taken, with a pre-planned move not paying off as intended but still forcing a corner.
Mbeumo fires in the corner from the right with Henry arriving at the front post, but the Bees left-back can't keep his header down and behind it goes!
Wissa has stayed down following a clash of heads with Andersen, and the Brentford striker comes off for further assessment as play is halted by the referee.
Eze, Edouard and Mitchell link up nicely as Palace come forward at pace, but the latter's cross is poor and sails over the top of any intended targets!
BLOCKED!!! Ayew dribbles his way into a crowded Brentford box before shooting, but he's completely surrounded by red and white shirts and Henry's block sends the ball behind for a corner!
Palace transition from defence to attack brilliantly as Edouard and Eze combine, but the midfielder finds his way blocked by a plethora of Brentford defenders and he can't get a shot away before being dispossessed!
Schlupp charges up the middle on the break for Palace, and again finds Eze in support. He cuts inside and looks to shoot early, but his effort skews well off-target and ends up closer to the corner flag than the goal itself!
Brentford have won each of the last three Premier League matches they've lead at half-time, last tasting defeat in April against Newcastle.
Andersen and Jensen clash in mid-air as Palace attempt cross after cross into the hosts' box, and it's Jensen who has come off worse, with the Dane staying down and holding his head.
Jensen eventually gets back to his feet and heads to the sideline for a concussion check, and here's hoping that he'll be able to continue.
Brentford have lost just five of their 23 Premier League matches in 2023, winning 11, with Manchester City the only ever-present team to lose fewer this year so far (three).
It's been one hell of a battle between Ward and Schade so far, and the two get into another tangle on the touchline which results in a Palace free-kick.
CHANCE!! Mitchell floats a ball into the box which is brought down by Eze, however Collins nips in to knock the ball away just as the Palace playmaker was about to pull the trigger!
SAVED!!! Cat-like reactions from Flekken! Hard running from Ayew engages defenders aplenty and leads to a Palace free-kick, which is struck goalwards by Edouard and parried over the top by the Brentford 'keeper!
WHAT A PAIR OF SAVES!!! From a Palace corner, Lerma's bullet header is somehow clawed off the line by Flekken, who then reacts brilliantly to block Ayew's close-range follow-up behind for another corner!
Here come the first changes for both teams, with Palace's seeing Edouard replaced up top by Jean-Philippe Mateta.
Schlupp also comes off, with Roy Hodgson introducing Naouirou Ahamada to play off the left for the Eagles.
Brentford's first change sees Frank Onyeka enter the fray, replacing Jensen at the heart of the hosts' midfield.
Ayew cuts inside and hooks an inviting ball towards the back post. Mateta is the target, but the towering Palace substitute can't quite get there as the ball flies behind for a goal kick!
BLOCKED!!! A woeful Ward touch allows Schade to race in behind the Palace captain and into the box. The goalscorer looks to cut the ball back across goal, but Ward recovers brilliantly to put it behind for a corner!
GOOOOAAAALLL!!!! The Eagles equalise!! Palace creep further and further forward as they keep possession on the edge of Brentford's box. Andersen picks it up and plays a one-two with Ayew, racing in behind and squeezing the ball beneath the onrushing Flekken to cross the line! A stroke of good fortune for the defender, but no less than Palace deserve, and as we head into the final throws of this game, its 1-1!
Ayew's presence in the final third has pulled Brentford's defence all over the place in this game, and standing up Henry in the box allowed Andersen to rush in behind the left-back and somehow squeeze the ball home.
While Ayew has attempted five shots in this game, his most in the Premier League since February 2020, and the five chances Andersen has created is his own record in the top-flight, their roles were reversed for Palace to lock the game up.
WIDE!!! Andersen picks out Ayew with a brilliant lofted throughball, but the forward can't find the target as he brings the ball down and fires it across the face to no-one!
Brentford goalscorer Schade comes off as we enter the final 10 minutes of this game, with Keane Lewis-Potter looking to make a similar impact as full-time ticks ever closer.
Mateta and Pinnock both slide to get on the end of a throughball into Brentford's box, and the Bees centre-back is left on the deck as the ball skews away from danger!
CHANCE!!! Henry steps inside and sends Janelt down the left byline, but his cross is cut out and put behind by Lerma, arriving on the edge of the six-yard box from nowhere!
Another clash in the air involves Andersen, but this time the Palace defender is left on the turf following Lewis-Potter's challenge. He's soon back to his feet though, and has certainly put himself about in this game!
BLOCKED!!! A wild Brentford chance goes begging! Onyeka's cross from the right is met on the volley by Janelt, but his ambitious, acrobatic effort strikes Lewis-Potter and bounces behind for a goal kick!
Palace have won three of their six Premier League away matches since Roy Hodgson’s return to the club. From the first of those away games – a 5-1 demolition of Leeds in April – to now, only Liverpool (11) have more away Premier League points than Palace's 10.
WIDE!!! Nearly an own-goal for the ages from Brentford! Lerma's in-swinging cross from the left strikes Norgaard, whose attempted header clear skews back towards his own posts and bounces inches wide with Flekken beaten!
BLOCKED!! The corner is cleared, but back come Palace as Ayew feeds Eze in the box. He shoots, but the packed Bees defence prevails and Henry gets the final touch to send the ball behind for another corner!
We'll play five additional minutes in west London, which at the pace we've seen this game played at, is more than enough for either side to find a late winner!
CHANCE!!! Ward's challenge on Janelt sends the ball back into the danger area, and Guehi has to race across to put the ball behind and prevent Lewis-Potter from going one-on-one with Johnstone!
CHANCE!!! Mbeumo barges his way forward before hooking a cross back from the byline. It bounces kindly for Henry on the edge of the box, but he takes a heavy touch and races after the ball. Ward gets in the way and takes the Bees left-back down, but the referee awards the hosts a corner rather than the penalty Henry was demanding!
BLOCKED!!! Mbeumo's reverse ball into the area is brought down skilfully by Onyeka, but his Guehi gets in the way of his half-volley to bail Palace out once again!
Brentford launch one last attack as Mbeumo finds Hickey running through with an inside ball, but the full-back's shot sails beyond the side netting as the full-time whistle goes!
FULL-TIME: BRENTFORD 1-1 CRYSTAL PALACE.
It's all over in west London, with the spoils shared at the end of a fiercely contested game. Andersen's equaliser 14 minutes from time came following a plethora of chances for Palace, and from then on, the two sides traded in unsuccessful efforts to find a winner. Brentford couldn't follow up Schade's first-half screamer with another goal, although Janelt, Mbeumo and Onyeka all had the opportunity to do so. Palace, meanwhile, forced a series of world-class saves from Flekken, with Edouard, Lerma and Ayew all denied to ensure the spoils were shared.
Ayew was a constant threat in the final third for Palace, and laid on the back-heeled pass for Andersen's eventual equaliser. The Ghana forward managed five total shots, albeit with just one on target, and that assist for Andersen was one of three chances created. With the ball at his feet, Ayew contested a game-high 21 duels, winning 11, as well as engaging in seven dribbles and winning possession on five occasions. He also won four free-kicks, conceding three himself, in a game which despite having a fair few stoppages, left us out of breath just trying to keep up!
A point apiece in this end-to-end London derby means Brentford's unbeaten start to the season continues, and the Bees sit sixth with five points from three games ahead of their next game against Bournemouth. Palace have now won, lost and drawn one game each in 2023-24, and are 10th in the table prior to facing Wolves at Selhurst Park next up.
That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game! Until the next one, it's goodbye for now."	Referee: Michael Oliver. Assistants: Stuart Burt, Dan Cook. Fourth official: Tim Robinson. VAR: Paul Tierney. Assistant VAR: Mark Scholes.	Team_20	Team_11	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this London derby in the Premier League. It’s west v south, as Team_4 host Team_8 at the Gtech Community Stadium.
A strong start to the season has seen Team_4 pick up four points, drawing 2-2 with Spurs on the opening day before thumping neighbours Team_10 3-0 at Craven Cottage. A third successive inter-city derby for the fourth-placed Bees gives them the chance to continue that impressive run, with the absence of Ivan Toney doing little to dent their free-scoring attack.
A deserved 1-0 defeat of Team_17 gave Palace a perfect start to the season, however the Eagles’ first home game saw them lose by the same scoreline to a 10-man Team_1 side, who survived a barrage of late pressure to escape Selhurst Park with all three points. Roy Hodgson’s men will look to get back to winning ways in this game though, having drawn both meetings with Team_4 1-1 last season.
Team_4 (4-3-3): Mark Flekken; Aaron Hickey, Nathan Collins, Ethan Pinnock, Rico Henry; Mathias Jensen, Christian Norgaard, Vitaly Janelt; Bryan Mbeumo, Yoane Wissa, Kevin Schade.
Team_4 SUBS: Ellery Balcombe, Zanka Jorgensen, Frank Onyeka, Kristoffer Ajer, Keane Lewis-Potter, Mads Roerslev, Yehor Karmolyuk, Michael Olakigbe, Ethan Brierley.
Team_8 (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Jefferson Lerma, Cheick Doucoure; Jordan Ayew, Eberechi Eze, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.
Team_8 SUBS: Remi Matthews, James Tomkins, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Nathaniel Clyne, Chris Richards, Naouirou Ahamada, John-Kymani Gordon, Jairo Riedewald, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi.
Team_4 name an unchanged XI following their impressive 3-0 win over Team_10, with Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo, who scored the opener and a second-half brace respectively last time out, leading the line alongside Kevin Schade for Thomas Frank’s side here.
Palace’s side is also unchanged for the third game running. After so very nearly taking a point off Team_1 at Selhurst Park, Roy Hodgson is clearly looking to develop the combinations for success in his team – many of which are built around Eberechi Eze, who starts in his usual number 10 position despite transfer interest from Team_13.
'Hey Jude' rings around west London as the teams enter the pitch, and we're ready and raring to go ahead of kick-off here!
Edouard gets proceedings underway for Palace, kicking off the latest of several London derbies so far this season!
All four Premier League meetings between Team_4 and Team_8 have ended in draws – no pair of teams have ever drawn their first five consecutive meetings in the competition’s history.
Andersen retreats with the ball after Wissa is caught offside, but the linesman takes a fair while to actually raise his flag and the Team_4 striker almost escapes through on goal!
Team_4 have won six of their last eight Premier League games, and have lost just one of the last 16 they've played at the Team_4 Community Stadium.
Team_4 keep possession well and the ball comes to Hickey on the right-hand side. He looks to cut inside Schlupp but is bowled over by the Palace winger, who concedes a free-kick in a good crossing position for the Bees.
Jensen floats the free-kick into the box early, looking to catch Palace out, but Guehi reads his intentions well and hooks the ball clear.
CHANCE!!! Palace pile forward on the counter-attack as Eze glides his way through several challenges. He finds Ayew, who slips Edouard in behind the defence, but after stepping in and out of Pinnock's attempted tackle, the Team_4 defender recovers to dispossess the striker in the box and Flekken can dive on the loose ball!
Mitchell slides into challenges with both Norgaard and Hickey, coming away with the ball and releasing Edouard. He charges down the left flank and looks for Eze to his right, but overhits the final pass and the chance goes begging!
Team_8 are aiming to win their opening two away games in a top-flight campaign for just a third time, previously doing so in 1997-98 and 2015-16.
A loose touch from Jensen in midfield allows Eze to race away with the ball before shooting, but the first attempt on goal we've seen so far is tame enough for Flekken to hold without breaking sweat.
Palace have won just four of their last 31 London derbies in the Premier League after losing 1-0 to Team_1 last time out. Only one of those wins has come away from home, against Team_19 in November 2022.
A smart ball from Norgaard releases Mbeumo down the right, but the Bees forward's cross on the fly is too close to Johnstone and the Palace goalkeeper collects.
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLLLL!!!! What a strike that is!!! The third prong of Team_4 attack pops up with a beauty after receiving a cross-field ball from Norgaard. Picking up the ball on the left, the German striker cuts inside and darts past Ward on the byline, before curling a firecracker of a shot beyond Johnstone and into the far corner! 1-0 to the Bees, and that finish certainly had some sting behind it!
Norgaard's ball from right to left was incisive, but certainly gave Schade a lot to do on his way to goal. Thankfully for the home side though, he was able to create something from nothing and give them the lead!
Schade nets his first of the season with Team_4 first goal of 2023-24 NOT scored by Wissa or Mbeumo, and it's the 15th home game in a row that the Bees have breached their opponents' defence.
WIDE!! Mitchell's hanging cross from the left is dealt with by the hosts, but Andersen returns serve from the opposite side. Ayew meets his cross with a glancing header towards the bottom corner, but Flekken can safely watch it bounce wide of the far post!
BLOCKED!!! Eze is released on the counter for Palace and cuts inside both Collins and Norgaard on his way to the edge of the box. With Team_4 seemingly at sixes and sevens, he shoots, but Henry is back there to block the effort away!
Palace have failed to any of their last three league matches after conceding the opening goal, dating back to an April victory over Team_19.
Schade stays down following a clash with Ayew as play continues in Palace's half. Team_4 soon get the free-kick they were after though, as Wissa is clipped late by Doucoure.
From the free-kick, Palace clear and Eze threatens to race away on the break once more, but Collins retreats in time to pinch the ball back for Team_4.
The rain has certainly arrived now - a storm brewing for a while prior to kick-off finally hits, and it's big coats all round as the heavens open above the Gtech Community Stadium.
Team_4 have lost just one of their last 12 home league games against Team_8, going down 3-0 on Christmas Day in 1957.
Schade spreads play wide to Henry, whose cross from the left strikes the back of Lerma and goes behind for the game's first corner.
Guehi tries a cross-field pass to the right, but neither Ward nor Ayew is making the run he wanted and the ball sails over the sideline.

We're into a solitary minute of added time as this end-to-end first half draws to a close in west London.
Mitchell's looping cross from the left is easily caught by Flekken, and that should be that for the first 45 minutes of this game.
HALF-TIME: Team_4 1-0 Team_8.

Andersen and Jensen clash in mid-air as Palace attempt cross after cross into the hosts' box, and it's Jensen who has come off worse, with the Dane staying down and holding his head.
Jensen eventually gets back to his feet and heads to the sideline for a concussion check, and here's hoping that he'll be able to continue.
Team_4 have lost just five of their 23 Premier League matches in 2023, winning 11, with Team_13 the only ever-present team to lose fewer this year so far (three).
It's been one hell of a battle between Ward and Schade so far, and the two get into another tangle on the touchline which results in a Palace free-kick.

WIDE!!! Nearly an own-goal for the ages from Team_4! Lerma's in-swinging cross from the left strikes Norgaard, whose attempted header clear skews back towards his own posts and bounces inches wide with Flekken beaten!
BLOCKED!! The corner is cleared, but back come Palace as Ayew feeds Eze in the box. He shoots, but the packed Bees defence prevails and Henry gets the final touch to send the ball behind for another corner!

A point apiece in this end-to-end London derby means Team_4 unbeaten start to the season continues, and the Bees sit sixth with five points from three games ahead of their next game against Team_3. Palace have now won, lost and drawn one game each in 2023-24, and are 10th in the table prior to facing Team_20 at Selhurst Park next up.
That's all from us, we hope you enjoyed the game! Until the next one, it's goodbye for now."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93420	Wolves	Newcastle	2023-10-28	Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton	31584.0	Anthony Taylor	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of today's Premier League clash between Everton and Bournemouth at Goodison Park!
Still with just one Premier League victory to their name this season, Everton were beaten 2-1 by Luton Town last time out, swiftly ending a welcome upturn in fortunes. Sean Dyche's side had previously posted their first league win with a 3-1 success at Brentford, before eliminating Aston Villa from the EFL Cup. Not since the final day of their troubled 2022-23 campaign have they kept a clean sheet in any competition, though that game saw Bournemouth beaten by an Abdoulaye Doucoure goal that preserved the Toffees' top-flight status for another year.
After a 4-0 reverse at Arsenal last week, Bournemouth's only wins this term remain a pair of EFL Cup victories over Championship sides Swansea City and Stoke City. The Cherries arrive on Merseyside following an 11-game streak without victory in the Premier League, and they sit second-bottom of the standings. Of particular concern for coach Andoni Iraola will be his team's record of conceding at least twice in all three of their away fixtures this season.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ashley Young, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Jack Harrison, James Garner, Amadou Onana, Dwight McNeil; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Making just one change to the team that started last week's loss to Luton, Everton promote Harrison to the lineup at Gueye's expense; the latter sustained an injury during the warm-up. Captain Seamus Coleman and midfielder Andre Gomes are the Toffees' most notable injury absentees.
Meanwhile, Iraola opts for two changes to a Bournmeouth side thumped by Arsenal last time out, as Aarons and Kluivert make way for Smith and Ouattara. Tyler Adams is set for a further spell on the sidelines due a thigh problem, joining Alex Scott, Lloyd Kelly, Ryan Fredericks and Chris Mepham in missing out today.
The players emerge from the tunnel and out onto the pitch at a sun-soaked Goodison Park, and kick-off is now just moments away!
Bournemouth kick off, and we are under way at Goodison!
A bright start for Bournemouth sees the away side zipping the ball around in midfield with confidence. They've come to play a possession-based game, and it could be quite a clash of styles.
Ending Everton's first attack, Zabarnyi blocks out McNeil's attempted throughball from the left side of the box, and then the Bournemouth defender completes a clearance from the same player's subsequent cross.
McNeil wriggles through two challenges just outside the box, but Smith eventually steals the ball off him and Zabarnyi is again alert to mop up the remaining danger.
EVERTON LEAD! After knocking lightly at the door twice, Everton stride through Bournemouth's defence and open the scoring! Zabarnyi errs to gift the ball to Garner 20 yards out, and the young midfielder drives towards goal before picking out the bottom-right corner! It's 1-0 to the Toffees, and the home fans are delighted!
For a clear - and quite cynical - trip on the pacy Outtara, Everton's veteran full-back Young becomes the first player booked today.
From a tight angle on the right, Solanke attempts to beat Pickford with a rasping drive, but his effort only ripples the side-netting. It was asking a lot to score from there, but he had few other credible options.
Tavernier delivers a free-kick from the left towards Billing at the back post, but after a somewhat panicky initial reaction, Everton ultimately scramble his nod-down away.
Following an exchange of passes by Onana and Doucoure, the ball arrives at McNeil's feet just outside the area, but he drags his low shot well wide of the right-hand post before holding his hand up by way of apology.
DOUBLE CHANCE! First, Harrison's powerful shot is inadvertently blocked by Calvert-Lewin inside the six-yard box, then the ball breaks to Doucoure, who sees a low strike saved by Neto, diving down to his right! Everton are totally on top now!
Smith blocks McNeil's cross out for a corner-kick, which Garner comes across to take. The latter's inswinger brushes Solanke's head at the near post and flies behind for another corner on the other side.
From Everton's third corner-kick in succession, an almighty scramble of bodies in the box results in the ball bouncing out to Harrison around 20 yards from goal. However, he sees another well-struck shot blocked - this time by one of several fast-closing Bournemouth defenders.
A foul on Senesi by Calvert-Lewin results in Everton's latest attack being brought to a premature conclusion by the referee. The hosts sense more goals are theirs for the taking during this first half, but are denied another chance by a rather harsh decision.
After Garner fails to fully clear a cross from Tavernier on the right, Bournemouth toss another ball into the box, which a defender has to hurriedly clear. The away side are finally building some attacking rhythm.
Having played a corner short on the right, Christie ultimately delivers the ball towards the back post from a more favourable angle. Everton are forced to concede another corner-kick, but nothing comes of it.
On the counter, Bournemouth break quickly, as Christie and Cook combine in midfield and the latter picks out Kerkez around 25 yards from goal. The full-back lashes his shot well over, though, via a deflection.
Everton survive successive corners, and for all their bright attacking play they still seem very nervous within the confines of their own area. A second goal would certainly settle things down in that regard, but the Toffees have scored just 11 times in their previous 17 Premier League home games, never netting more than once in that run.
Garner apologises to his team-mates, after an optimistic low strike from outside the box deflects off Zabarnyi and trickles tamely towards Neto in the Bournemouth goal.
After another Tavernier free-kick from the left, Billing again nods the ball down into the danger area, but Ouattara then sends his volleyed effort several yards over the crossbar.
Calvert-Lewin bursts down the right, reaches the byline and then presses Neto into action - the Bournemouth captain prods the ball away with his leg for a corner.
WHAT A HIT FROM HARRISON! Everton lead 2-0! After Neto makes a second punch clear under pressure, the ball drops into the path of Harrison, waiting just outside the area. He takes aim and places a perfectly-struck shot into the net via the bottom of the crossbar! It's a composed finish that gives his side a precious two-goal advantage!
Bournemouth have now conceded nine first-half goals in eight Premier League games this season, more than any other team. Can there be any way back from this for the south coast side?
In behind Bournemouth's defence, McNeil can't quite catch up with a long ball from the back, but he applauds the intention as his chase ends unsuccessfully on the right byline.
Crossed wires between Garner and Doucoure mean the latter fails to connect with a dangerous low cross along the box, having decided to stand and wait for a cutback instead. Then, at the second attempt, Young gets a shot away from the edge of the area - however, it zips wide of the right-hand post.
Summing up Bournemouth's first half, a lively attacking move falters on the right flank, as Outtara fails to connect properly with a cross and rather comically shins the ball straight out of play.
OFF THE BAR! After Doucoure crosses for Calvert-Lewin, the striker climbs highest in the box and plants a close-range header against the top of the crossbar! Then, on the follow-up, Mykolenko's deflected cross is flashed just wide by Onana, who spins to strike at goal!
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 2-0 BOURNEMOUTH
Everton's Premier League losing streak at Goodison could be coming to an end, as the home side have dominated lacklustre Bournemouth during the first half and could quite easily be leading 3-0. Instead, the Toffees' advantage stands at two - thanks to goals from Garner and Harrison - and aside from struggling to deal with a series of corners, they have been in charge for most of the game so far.
The picture looks bleak for Bournemouth at the break, as they've yet to manage a shot on target and star striker Solanke has barely touched the ball. Does Iraola have a 'Plan B' his team can turn to now? Otherwise, Dyche is set to post his sixth straight win over the Cherries.
Making one change at half-time, Bournemouth respond to their first half display by replacing Christie with Rothwell in central midfield.
Everton kick off, and we are back under way at Goodison Park!
CHANCE! Another mistake by Zabarnyi lets Everton in again, but Doucoure places his close-range shot straight at Neto, who makes a straightforward save! That's a real let-off for Bournemouth, who have been abject at the back today.
Once more, Doucoure fails to take advantage of a good attacking situation, as he hesitates when Everton break through the middle, and by the time he decides what to do, their momentum has already evaporated.
Making a clearance from inside his own area, Branthwaite slices the ball behind for a corner. Much to Iraola's apparent frustration, Billing then wastes the set-piece situation.
Kerkez brings down Harrison midway through Bournemouth's half, conceding a free-kick. Garner then plays the ball short to McNeil, who sends in a rather aimless ball towards the penalty spot. That was not the best use of another attacking opportunity.
Bournemouth are yet to test Pickford in the Everton goal, so Iraola seems to be readying another substitute near the touchline - perhaps more support for Solanke up front?
Replaced by another winger, Sinisterra, Ouattara is withdrawn just before the hour-mark.
Solanke hauls back Onana by the arm and receives a yellow card from the referee.
Bringing down a dropping ball upfield, Calvert-Lewin does well to spin inside from the right side of the box, but his subsequent shot is sent spiralling over the crossbar.
3-0 EVERTON! Surely that seals it! A cross is stood up by McNeil from the right, then Harrison's close-range header is blocked on the goal line by Kerkez. The ball then rebounds back off Harrison, and Doucoure lashes it home from five yards!
After his goal-bound header is blocked, Harrison inadvertently deflects the ball towards Doucoure, who nets Everton's third goal of the game.
Due to his complaints following Doucoure's goal, Neto is booked.
McNeil skips away from Zabarnyi on the left, then delivers an inviting ball towards the near post: Doucoure meets it with a volley, but can't control it. Everton are all over their ailing opponents here, and they want more goals!
CLOSE! Really enjoying himself now, McNeil again makes the play, slipping a ball through to Calvert-Lewin, who then chips the ball over a fast-closing Neto but just wide of the left-hand post!
A belated change of approach from Bournemouth: first, Cook comes off and Moore is sent on up front.
A full-back, Kerkez, also departs; creative midfielder Brooks will replace him.
From central midfield, Garner plays Harrison in down the right flank, but the latter's cross is overhit by some distance and Everton's latest attack comes to nothing.
Following dangerous crosses from either side, McNeil sets up Garner to strike from the edge of the box, but the latter sees his shot blocked and Bournemouth launch a quick counter. At its end, Solanke nods straight at Pickford from near the penalty spot.
Looking for a second goal of the game, Doucoure cuts inside Rothwell just outside the box, but he then hurries his shot, which is sent high over Neto's goal and into the stand.
DOUBLE CHANCE! From a tight angle, Onana twice comes close to scoring! First he has a header blocked by Billing at the near post, then Neto denies him with a close-range save! He'll have to settle for a corner!
At the second attempt, Neto gathers in the ball following a stinging low drive by Garner from 20 yards out. It's still a one-way blue tide at Goodison, and Bournemouth are well and truly beaten.
OFF THE LINE! That's Bournemouth's best chance! Billing nods a cross into Zabarnyi's path, but the defender sees his shot hacked off the goal line by McNeil! Then, the Everton winger appears at the end of a rapid counter-attack and tests Neto with a shot!
After putting in a good shift in midfield, Harrison is withdrawn and Patterson comes on to replace him.
Patterson makes an immediate impact, as he races on to Young's throughball and almost picks out Calvert-Lewin with a cutback from the right flank.
SAVE! Pickford prevents Moore from grabbing a consolation! After the Bournemouth substitute beats Patterson in the air near the penalty spot, his flicked header is pawed away by the Everton goalkeeper!
Soaking up warm applause from the home fans, Calvert-Lewin departs, as ex-Udinese striker Beto comes on for the closing stages.
For the second straight game, Everton have fired in more than 20 shots - but this time, their efforts have been handsomely rewarded. Could this prove a pivotal moment for their 2023-24 campaign?
Iraola makes his final change: Smith is replaced by Aarons.
A Sinisterra delivery from the left byline is met by Moore's head at the near post, but he can't change the ball's angle sufficiently and sends it straight behind for a goal-kick.
Beto is frustrated when his run behind Bournemouth's defence is not supplied by a better pass, as the ball trickles through to Neto. Then, at the other end, Pickford gets down well to tip Tavernier's low shot behind for a corner.
Dyche offers another striker a brief cameo, as Chermiti comes on for Doucoure.
In the third minute of at least five added on for stoppages, an alert Neto races off his line to beat Chermiti to the ball, following an incisive throughball by Young.
Patterson's cross is too strong for Beto and flashes wide of the Portuguese forward, who had made his run into the centre. Then, Beto finds the side-netting from a very tight angle on the right, having been played in by the irrepressible McNeil.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 3-0 BOURNEMOUTH
A commitment to attack and Bournemouth's defensive deficiencies combine to help Everton end their search for a first Premier League win at Goodison this season. The Toffees flooded forward in numbers, aided by their visitors' timid resistance, and they effectively decided the game by scoring twice before the break. Onana then applied the finishing touch during the second half, consigning Bournemouth to yet another away defeat.
After the international break, Everton will go straight into the Merseyside derby versus Liverpool. Meanwhile, beleaguered Bournemouth resume Premier League duty with back-to-back home games against Wolves and Burnley.
That's all from Goodison Park today, so thank you for joining us and goodbye!"	"Wolverhampton Wanderers came from behind twice to hold Newcastle United to a 2-2 draw, extending their unbeaten run to five Premier League matches.
Mario Lemina cancelled out Callum Wilson’s opening goal with a header from Pedro Neto’s corner, with Neto providing a league-leading seventh assist of the season. And although Wilson restored Newcastle’s lead with a first-half penalty, Hwang Hee-chan levelled again in the 71st minute with his sixth league goal of the season.
Wolves have now drawn with both Aston Villa and Newcastle in their undefeated run, while also beating Manchester City.
But their latest success will be bittersweet as they lost influential winger Neto to injury, with the Portuguese star pulling up with what appeared to be a hamstring injury.
Newcastle’s Sean Longstaff went close early on with a low shot, and the Magpies went ahead in the 22nd minute as Jose Sa fumbled the ball to Wilson, who scored acrobatically after his initial shot was blocked.
In an end-to-end match, Wolves' Matheus Cunha drove forward down the left side and forced a fine low save from Nick Pope, before Neto’s 35th-minute shot was palmed over the bar.
Newcastle’s relief was short-lived because Lemina headed in from Neto’s resulting corner.
But the Magpies responded themselves and won a penalty at the end of the first half, with Hwang adjudged to have caught Fabian Schar as the Wolves striker tried to clear the ball. Sa got a big hand on Wilson’s spot-kick but was unable to keep the ball out.
Wilson has now scored 16 of his 17 Premier League penalties, or 94 per cent, a conversion rate which is only bettered by Danny Murphy and Matt Le Tissier among players who have taken at least 15 spot-kicks in the competition.
Newcastle were unable to press home their advantage though, and Wolves were on top for most of the second half, deservedly equalising again in the 71st minute. Toti Gomes embarked on a skilful run infield from the right flank and slipped a pass through to Hwang, who cut inside Dan Burn brilliantly before firing home at the near post.
Neto threatened a winner as he attacked the edge of the box, but just as he was about to pull the trigger on his shot he pulled up clutching the back of his leg, before being taken off the pitch on a stretcher.
Newcastle had a big chance to add to Wolves’ agony, but Schar headed wide at close range.
The sixth-placed Magpies missed the chance to go fifth but are now unbeaten in six matches, while Wolves are 12th with 12 points.

Still with just one Premier League victory to their name this season, Team_9 were beaten 2-1 by Team_12 last time out, swiftly ending a welcome upturn in fortunes. Sean Dyche's side had previously posted their first league win with a 3-1 success at Team_4, before eliminating Team_2 from the EFL Cup. Not since the final day of their troubled 2022-23 campaign have they kept a clean sheet in any competition, though that game saw Team_3 beaten by an Abdoulaye Doucoure goal that preserved the Toffees' top-flight status for another year.
After a 4-0 reverse at Team_1 last week, Team_3 only wins this term remain a pair of EFL Cup victories over Championship sides Swansea City and Stoke City. The Cherries arrive on Merseyside following an 11-game streak without victory in the Premier League, and they sit second-bottom of the standings. Of particular concern for coach Andoni Iraola will be his team's record of conceding at least twice in all three of their away fixtures this season.
Team_9 (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ashley Young, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Jack Harrison, James Garner, Amadou Onana, Dwight McNeil; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
SUBS: Joao Virginia, Lewis Dobbin, Beto, Michael Keane, Youssef Chermiti, Ben Godfrey, Arnaut Danjuma, Nathan Patterson, Amadou Onana.
Team_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Marcos Senesi, Milos Kerkez; Lewis Cook, Ryan Christie; Marcus Tavernier, Philip Billing, Dango Ouattara; Dominic Solanke.

93502	Bournemouth	Fulham	2023-12-26	Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth	11099.0	Tim Robinson	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Manchester City and Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium!
City are looking to close the gap to the table before they go off to play in the Club World Cup, and a win here would lift them into second, above Arsenal on goal difference. They were winless in four in the Premier League (D3 L1) but managed to turn things around with a comeback win against Luton Town last time out in the competition (2-1). They come into this game on the back of finishing a perfect Champions League campaign with their win over Red Star Belgrade and will be looking to follow that up with another three points here after drawing their last two league games at home against Liverpool and Tottenham.
As for Palace, they sit at the other end of the table and are looking to end a winless run of their own. They haven't managed a victory in their last five outings (D1 L4), even dropping the lead to lose 2-1 to Liverpool last weekend. They've actually won just one of their previous nine matches (D2 L6), and have a poor record against City, winning just two of their last 16 games against the Citizens. Both of those victories did come at the Etihad though.
MANCHESTER CITY STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri, Rico Lewis; Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish; Julian Alvarez.
MANCHESTER CITY SUBS: Kalvin Phillips, Manuel Akanji, Sergio Gomez, Matheus Nunes, Stefan Ortega, Mateo Kovacic, Oscar Bobb, John Stones, Mahamadou Susoho.
CRYSTAL PALACE STARTING XI (5-4-1): Dean Henderson; Nathaniel Clyne, Joel Ward, Joachim  Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Michael Olise, Jairo Riedewald, Chris Richards, Jeffrey Schlupp; Jean-Philippe Mateta.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Naouirou Ahamada, Matheus Franca, James Tomkins, Eberechi Eze, David Ozoh, Tayo Adaramola, Malcolm Ebiowei, Remi Matthews, Ademola Ola-Adebomi.
After making wholesale changes for the Champions League game in midweek, Pep Guardiola goes back to the side that beat Luton last weekend with just one swap. Lewis comes into midfield in place of Kovacic, who drops to the bench. Grealish is the only one to have started both previous games, and he's shaken off a knock to retain his place. They're still without Erling Haaland and Jeremy Doku through injury though.
Roy Hodgson makes five changes from their defeat to Liverpool last Saturday and they're all enforced. Sam Johnstone, Odsonne Edouard, Jefferson Lerma and Will Hughes are all injured, while Jordan Ayew is suspended, so they're all out. Henderson and Mitchell return from injury to start, with Olise, Riedewald and Mateta also being brought in.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Olise gets the game under way for Palace!
City knock it neatly through Palace, but Grealish comes back from an offside position to pick out Foden. Henderson takes the resulting free-kick, sending it long, but he fouls Ake when he tries to hold him off.
Andersen is too casual when Henderson plays it out to him and Grealish pounces onto it. He's the furthest forward so has to go back, and Palace can breathe a sigh of relief when Rodri plays it straight out of play.
GOOD SAVE! Silva touches it back to Walker, who floats a lovely cross onto the edge of the six-yard box. Alvarez gets a glancing touch with his head, and Henderson stretches to tip it wide for a corner.
City's first corner results in a quick second, and Alvarez curls this one deep to the far post. Ake nods it back into the crowd and Dias stretches to poke it back out to the Dutchman, but he was caught on his heels.
CHANCE! Walker's low, fizzed cross is blocked by Guehi, and it rebounds back out to Dias on the edge of the box. He catches the shot sweetly, but it's just too high as it sails over the bar.
WIDE! Dias stops Schlupp in his tracks, and he sets Lewis on the counter. He takes it to the edge of the D before teeing up Rodri, but his first-time shot flies wide of the far post.
Since Guardiola was appointed City manager, only Manchester United (three) have won more away league games against the Citizens than Palace (two).
It's a brilliant run from Grealish down the left as he just breezes down the wing before teeing up Foden. That's when Palace decide to get touch-tight, and he has no space to work in.
BLOCK! Silva touches it into the byline for Lewis to pull back, and his low ball causes all sorts of confusion. It pinballs off Mateta to Foden, whose first-time shot hits Guehi, and his block just rolls wide of the far post.
City are upping the pressure and keeping Palace penned back deep in their own half. Silva is already getting a lot of joy down the right, spinning past Mitchell with some clever footwork, but his cross is cleared by Andersen.
City have already had 75 per cent possession in the first 20 minutes, and they're continuing to patiently try and open up space. Palace's switch to a back five looks to be working perfectly so far.
Grealish leaves the ball behind in a turn, and Olise instantly sets off on the counter. He has support to his left and looks for Schlupp, but his first touch forces him wide, and City comfortably deal with the danger.
GREALISH SCORES! It's a lovely worked goal by City! Grealish touches it out to Dias, who isn't put under any pressure by Palace and he's able to pick out Foden on the edge of the D. He pulls off a lovely turn before sliding it through to Grealish, who drills his low shot across goal and into the far bottom corner. VAR checks it for offside, and he just times his run. 1-0 City!
It's a wonderful turn by Foden on the edge of the D, and he kees the ball glued to his boot as he does, allowing him to spot Grealish's run.
From one angle, Grealish looked to be standing in an offside position, but as VAR changes view, it looks a lot tighter than it originally did. It takes them a long time to draw the lines in, but when they do, it shows that he was just onside. The goal stands!
City quickly win it back from the restart and go back to their patient play until Riedewald steps in to win it back in midfield. He looks to set Mateta on his way, but the linesman's flag cuts it short.
GOOD SAVE! The midfield is very compact, so when Dias can't pick out a short pass, he clips it over the top, where Gvardiol has gotten between two of the centre-backs. He drills his shot on goal, but Henderson gets behind it to smother the effort.
Mateta is truly playing as a lone striker, and when Palace do manage to get the ball to him, he's struggling. He holds it up well against Walker this time, but has nobody to pick out in support, meaning City win it straight back.
While defending a free-kick, Ward slips awkwardly and the medical team are quickly rushed onto the field. He hands the captain's armband to Guehi as he gets back to his feet, and Palace's injury woes get worse.
Ward makes his way straight off the pitch with the physio, and 18-year-old Ozoh is brought on in his place.
CLOSE! Silva gets the better of Mitchell down the right again, and his cross is only flicked on as far as Gvardiol on the far side. He brings it down before hitting it on the half-volley, but a nick off Ozoh helps it into the side netting.
Grealish has scored in three consecutive Premier League games for the first time, with each goal giving Manchester City the lead.
The ball is there to be won, but Ake just gets there ahead of Andersen's sliding challenge. There isn't too much contact, but the Dane is shown the first yellow card of the game.
CLOSE! Silva's floated free-kick is glanced on by Richards at the far post, and Lewis keeps it alive on the right. He touches it back to Foden, who tries his luck from range, coming close as it skims just wide of the top corner and into the side netting.
It's a great throughball from Olise, and Ederson hesitates, despite already being a long way off his line. In the end, he gets there after Mateta, swiping his legs out from under him, and he goes into the book.
SO CLOSE! Olise steps up to take the free-kick just outside the box and he isn't far away! He lifts his effort over the wall and it has Ederson scrambling, but it sails just over the bar, landing on the roof of the net.
Into the first of five added minutes here, and City are back to camping out in Palace's half. The visitors are slow to close them down, not wanting to lose their shape to gift their opponents any space.
Palace are attempting to counter once more, but when Mateta touches it out to Olise, he has three City players around him. He can't get far, but does manage to win a free-kick when he's nudged over by Gvardiol.
HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 1-0 CRYSTAL PALACE.
Grealish's goal gives City a 1-0 lead over Palace at half-time. The hosts dominated from the first whistle, but after Henderson was forced into a good save to deny Alvarez early on, City struggled to create anything clear-cut until something a little special. Foden's lovely turn on the edge of the D opened up the space to slide in Grealish, who picked out the bottom corner and was shown to be just onside by VAR. At the other end, Palace's best chance came from a free-kick given away by Ederson, but Olise's shot was just too high.
For the majority of the first 45 minutes, it was all one team, even if City did struggle to break down their opponents more often. Guardiola will be after more of the same, just with a more clinical edge. As for Palace, they started to show glimpses of the problems they could cause, and Hodgson will be looking for them to pick up where they left off in an attempt to get back into this game.
City get us back under way for the second half!
City have started the second half in similar vain to the first, but a sloppy pass from Gvardiol gifts it to Olise. He surges down the right but has to wait too long for support, so his eventual cross is cut out.
All of City's outfield players created a chance in the first half against Palace. This is the first time on record (2006-07 onwards) that 10 different players have created a chance for one team in the first half of a Premier League game.
NO GOAL! Grealish won a free-kick just outside the box on the left and Alvarez floats a lovely cross straight into the far post. Rodri had just stepped up too early though and ducks under the ball. He's judged to be interfering with play, and the goal is ruled out. Still 1-0 City!
LEWIS SCORES! And that one will count! Grealish cuts inside from the left and carries it to the edge of the box before looking for Foden. His first touch loops up between Rodri and Lewis, but it's the latter who takes the chance, volleying it past Henderson and into the back of the net. After a quick VAR check for offside, the goal stands! 2-0 City!
Palace look a little shaky after City's latest spell, and Henderson sloppily puts the ball out of play. The Citizens are pushing forward with intent once more, but the visitors aren't as compact as they once were.
City win their sixth corner of the game, and Alvarez looks to pick out Gvardiol in the middle once more. He glances his header towards goal, but Henderson is able to hold onto it.
Ozoh tries to keep Palace's rare chance to attack alive, but Foden is just too quick for him. Both Riedewald and Richards try to stop him from mounting a counter, but give away a free-kick in the centre circle.
Palace just can't get out of their own half at the moment, and they're hesitant to press high upfield. The City centrebacks are allowed to carry it a long way, and their passes over the top are causing a few problems.
GREAT SAVE! Foden is scrambling to reach the ball after a loose touch, but it ends up being a good set-up for Silva. He hits it first time, curling his long-range shot towards the far post, and at full stretch, Henderson tips it wide.
Henderson hurt himself making that save, and he's complaining about a muscle problem. Having just come back from injury, Hodgson might be worried about him, but the keeper is back on his feet to carry on.
Palace's best out ball has been Olise all game, and he has another chance to run down the right. He has to hold it up again as support is slow to get up, and that gives Rodri the chance to stop him from getting into the box.
Grealish and Gvardiol are linking up well down the left, but City are once again struggling to put the ball into the box. They switch it out to the right and back again, but a sloppy pass from Rodri eases the pressure on Palace.
Palace have everyone apart from Mateta back in their own box to continue to deny City any hope of passing it into the goal. Silva is still trying to make something happen down the right, but can't dribble past Mitchell.
Olise sets off down the right again, and gets the better of Ake as he pulls it back to Ozoh. Just like every time before, there are more sky blue shirts flooding back, and Palace can't do anything with it.
It's Dias who pushes forward down the right for City now, and he gets a yard on Mitchell to drill a low cross into the six-yard box. It's too close to Henderson though, and the keeper turns it away with an outstretched leg.
MATETA PULLS ONE BACK! Out of nowhere, Palace are level! Richards plays it long over the top from inside his own half, and Walker just switches off as Schlupp darts between him and Dias. The winger plays the cross through Dias' legs and Mateta is completely free in the middle of the six-yard box to tap it into an empty net. 2-1!
It's a great run from Schlupp off the back of Walker, and he draws Ederson towards the ball as well, leaving the space for Mateta to attack his cross.
City uncharacteristically get a little sloppy with the ball, and Palace are enjoying their best spell of possession here. It's all deep in their own half though, and they don't look quite sure how to get themselves upfield.
Grealish plays himself out of a tight spot well, and Rodri benefits by sweeping it out to Silva in space down the right. His touch lets him down for the first time today, and he can't stop the ball from rolling out of play.
Palace are making a double change now. Riedewald is the first to go off, with Ahamada on in his place.
And for something different up front, he's bringing on Franca in place of Schlupp.
Ozoh does brilliantly to hold off Gvardiol and keep the ball in play, but Olise is fouled by Ake when he's played in. He tries to take the free-kick quickly, but slips as he does, giving City a chance to get back.
After another patient spell of possession in front of Palace, Lewis goes for a more direct option with a long ball down the right. It's too heavy for Silva though, and Henderson is able to claim it.
GOOD SAVE! Foden comes up with another bit of brilliant play that opens up the space ahead of him. He works it out to the right, with Silva cutting inside before curling a shot on goal that Henderson stretches to tip away.
Palace look tired and there's not a lot of movement in front of City, who are passing it between their defenders. Olise has a half-hearted attempt at a press, but the hosts easily pass their way around him.
It's a poor pass from Ederson, and Olise cuts it out, pushing Gvardiol aside so that he can swing in a cross. He gets too much on it in his haste though, curling it straight out of play.
Palace's final change of the game sees Eze making his return from an ankle injury in place of Clyne for the four minutes of stoppage time.
PENALTY TO PALACE! Franca's cross caused City all sorts of problems, and Richards can only knock it onto Mateta. He sees Foden coming and touches the ball away before getting a kick to the shin. The referee points straight to the spot, and City are furious. Palace have the chance to snatch a late point here!
OLISE SCORES! Palace equalise in the final minute! It's cool as you like from the Frenchman, who takes a short run-up to the spot, and stutters just before striking the ball. He slots it down the left side of the goal, and Ederson, who had already shifted his weight the opposite way, can only watch it roll into the bottom corner. 2-2!
City have been waiting to make this change since the first minute of stoppage time, and they can finally bring Stones on for Lewis.
Eze goes down cheaply near the corner flag under pressure from Gvardiol to win a late free-kick. It's whipped in by Olise, but he can't pick out a team-mate in the crowd in the middle.
FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-2 CRYSTAL PALACE.
Olise's stoppage-time penalty snatches a late point for Palace as they come from behind to draw 2-2 with City. The first half was dominated by the Citizens, and Grealish gave them a deserved lead with a low finish into the bottom corner which was ruled just onside by VAR. After the break, Alvarez had a goal ruled out due to Rodri ducking under his free-kick from an offside position, but Lewis did double their lead moments later with a lovely volley. In the 76th minute, Mateta pulled one back for Palace with their first shot on target as he tapped Schlupp's cross into an empty net, and he won the penalty in the final minute when Foden kicked his shin. Olise coolly slotted it in to deny City the win. Guardiola's side miss the chance to move second as they register their third consecutive home draw, and they stay fourth, three points off Liverpool. Next up for them is Urawa Reds in the Club World Cup semi-final on Tuesday. It's a huge point for Palace given their recent run of form. They stay in 15th as they turn their attention to Brighton at home on Thursday. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"AFC Bournemouth picked up their sixth win in seven matches and climbed into the top half of the table as they beat Fulham 3-0 at Vitality Stadium.
Justin Kluivert gave the Cherries a half-time lead, and Dominic Solanke then scored his 12th Premier League goal of the season, moving joint-second alongside Mohamed Salah in the race for the Castrol Golden Boot, just two goals behind top scorer Erling Haaland.
Luis Sinisterra added gloss to the scoreline in stoppage time as Bournemouth secured their first-ever Boxing Day victory in the Premier League and moved five points outside the top six.
After an even start from both sides, Bournemouth had a great chance to take the lead just after the 30-minute mark as Kluivert’s effort from close range was blocked brilliantly by Tosin Adarabioyo at the last second.
But Kluivert did put the Cherries ahead just before the break. Summer signing Alex Scott, making only his fifth Premier League appearance for Bournemouth due to injury, dribbled past four players before setting up Kluivert, and the winger’s strike went underneath Bernd Leno and into the net.
Fulham dominated possession in the opening stages of the second half but failed to create a goalscoring opportunity, and they were made to pay for their passive play in the 61st minute.
Joao Palhinha brought down Antoine Semenyo in the box, and Bournemouth were awarded their first penalty for 609 days. Solanke sent Leno the wrong way from the spot to score in his fifth consecutive league match against Fulham.
Bournemouth appealed for a second penalty just minutes later when Antonee Robinson caught Kluivert with a stray leg, but referee Tim Robinson was not interested.
Sinisterra managed to make it 3-0 in the second minute of stoppage time with a fantastic strike. He cut inside off the left wing and curled the ball into the top-right corner, leaving Leno with no chance.
Fulham remain 13th with 21 points.

City are looking to close the gap to the table before they go off to play in the Club World Cup, and a win here would lift them into second, above Team_1 on goal difference. They were winless in four in the Premier League (D3 L1) but managed to turn things around with a comeback win against Team_12 last time out in the competition (2-1). They come into this game on the back of finishing a perfect Champions League campaign with their win over Red Star Belgrade and will be looking to follow that up with another three points here after drawing their last two league games at home against Team_11 and Team_18.
As for Palace, they sit at the other end of the table and are looking to end a winless run of their own. They haven't managed a victory in their last five outings (D1 L4), even dropping the lead to lose 2-1 to Team_11 last weekend. They've actually won just one of their previous nine matches (D2 L6), and have a poor record against City, winning just two of their last 16 games against the Citizens. Both of those victories did come at the Etihad though.
Team_13 STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri, Rico Lewis; Bernardo Silva, Phil Foden, Jack Grealish; Julian Alvarez.
Team_13 SUBS: Kalvin Phillips, Manuel Akanji, Sergio Gomez, Matheus Nunes, Stefan Ortega, Mateo Kovacic, Oscar Bobb, John Stones, Mahamadou Susoho.
Team_8 STARTING XI (5-4-1): Dean Henderson; Nathaniel Clyne, Joel Ward, Joachim  Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Michael Olise, Jairo Riedewald, Chris Richards, Jeffrey Schlupp; Jean-Philippe Mateta.
Team_8 SUBS: Naouirou Ahamada, Matheus Franca, James Tomkins, Eberechi Eze, David Ozoh, Tayo Adaramola, Malcolm Ebiowei, Remi Matthews, Ademola Ola-Adebomi.

PENALTY TO PALACE! Franca's cross caused City all sorts of problems, and Richards can only knock it onto Mateta. He sees Foden coming and touches the ball away before getting a kick to the shin. The referee points straight to the spot, and City are furious. Palace have the chance to snatch a late point here!
OLISE SCORES! Palace equalise in the final minute! It's cool as you like from the Frenchman, who takes a short run-up to the spot, and stutters just before striking the ball. He slots it down the left side of the goal, and Ederson, who had already shifted his weight the opposite way, can only watch it roll into the bottom corner. 2-2!
City have been waiting to make this change since the first minute of stoppage time, and they can finally bring Stones on for Lewis.
Eze goes down cheaply near the corner flag under pressure from Gvardiol to win a late free-kick. It's whipped in by Olise, but he can't pick out a team-mate in the crowd in the middle.
FULL-TIME: Team_13 2-2 Team_8.
Olise's stoppage-time penalty snatches a late point for Palace as they come from behind to draw 2-2 with City. The first half was dominated by the Citizens, and Grealish gave them a deserved lead with a low finish into the bottom corner which was ruled just onside by VAR. After the break, Alvarez had a goal ruled out due to Rodri ducking under his free-kick from an offside position, but Lewis did double their lead moments later with a lovely volley. In the 76th minute, Mateta pulled one back for Palace with their first shot on target as he tapped Schlupp's cross into an empty net, and he won the penalty in the final minute when Foden kicked his shin. Olise coolly slotted it in to deny City the win. Guardiola's side miss the chance to move second as they register their third consecutive home draw, and they stay fourth, three points off Team_11. Next up for them is Urawa Reds in the Club World Cup semi-final on Tuesday. It's a huge point for Palace given their recent run of form. They stay in 15th as they turn their attention to Team_5 at home on Thursday. That's all for today, goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93616	Man City	Arsenal	2024-03-31	Etihad Stadium, Manchester	53422.0	Anthony Taylor	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Bournemouth and Everton at the Vitality Stadium.
Bournemouth were going through a tough run of form at the end of February and had won just one of their last seven Premier League outings after their 1-0 loss to Manchester City. However, they have collected seven points from their previous three top-flight outings to move up to 13th position. Andoni Iraola would’ve targeted the three fixtures against Burnley, Sheffield United and Luton Town as a chance to string some positive results together, and the Spaniard would’ve been delighted with their victory over the Clarets before a hard-fought draw against the Blades. Bournemouth then produced the comeback of the season against the Hatters, coming from 3-0 down to win 4-3 in their last outing, becoming the third team in Premier League history to win a match after trailing by three goals at half-time.
Everton are embroiled in a relegation battle and are winless in their last 11 Premier League matches. The Toffees went into the international break after a 2-0 loss to Manchester United at Old Trafford, gifting the hosts two first-half penalties whilst failing to score themselves despite creating an xG (expected goals) of 1.61 from their 23 shots. It has certainly been a season to forget for Sean Dyche's men, who have already been deducted six points for breaking profit and sustainability rules (PSR), with the total initially standing at 10 before a successful appeal. However, Everton will soon discover if they will have another points deduction for a second PSR breach, as the hearing took place earlier this week. The visitors are currently in 16th position in the table, four points above Nottingham Forest, who are just inside the relegation zone after being given a four-point deduction for a PSR breach earlier this month.
BOURNEMOUTH (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Chris Mepham, Illia Zabarnyi, Milos Kerkez; Tyler Adams, Lewis Cook; Antoine Semenyo, Justin Kluivert, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke.
BOURNEMOUTH SUBS: Lloyd Kelly, Romain Faivre, Dango Ouattara, Alex Scott, James Hill, Enes Unal, Philip Billing, Max Aarons, Mark Travers.
EVERTON (4-5-1): Jordan Pickford; Seamus Coleman, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Ben Godfrey; Jack Harrison, Amadou Onana, Abdoulaye Doucoure, James Garner, Dwight McNeil; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Joao Virginia, Beto, Ashley Young, Andre Gomes, Idrissa Gueye, Youssef Chermiti, Lewis Warrington.
Bournemouth make four alterations to the side that beat Luton 4-3 in a Premier League classic in their last outing. Adams returns from injury to make his first top-flight start for the Cherries, seven months after signing from Leeds United. He comes into the midfield and replaces Ryan Christie. However, it has not been all positive news for Iraola, who is without Luis Sinisterra after the Colombian sustained a hamstring strain during the international break. Tavernier appears on the wing, with Kluivert picked ahead of Scott. Finally, Kerkez is preferred to Ouattara at left-back.
Everton make two changes to the team that lost to United at Old Trafford. Vitaliy Mykolenko is out of the squad through illness and is replaced at full-back by Coleman, who captains the side. Calvert-Lewin starts up front, with Beto dropping to the bench.
Bournemouth are unbeaten in all six of their Premier League home games against Everton (winning four and drawing two), winning the last two while scoring three goals each time. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.
Bournemouth get this Premier League clash under way. Solanke with the first kick. The teams swapped sides before the start.
SAVE AND OVER! The first opportunity goes to Bournemouth. Cook drives forward with possession and lays a pass down the right to Semenyo, who arrives with the ball on the edge of the box. He switches it onto his left foot and curls a low effort towards the bottom-left corner, but Pickford gets down to push it away. Cook then blasts the rebound well over.
Smith is making his 200th Premier Legaue appearance for Bournemouth and makes a nice pass over to to Semenyo on the right. He tries to go past Godfrey, but the defender does well to stay with him and pokes the ball out for a corner.
SAVE! Cook sends a low, outswinging cross towards the near post, with Kluivert darting away from his marker to get onto the end of the cross. The winger then flicks a first-time effort on target, but Pickford makes himself big to block it.
CHANCE! What a counter from Bournemouth. Pickford's direct free-kick from inside Everton's half is cleared away by the Cherries, with Tavernier driving a pass down the right to Kluivert. He waits for support and looks to cut it across to Solanke in the middle of the box, but it is cleared away.
Kluivert and Tavernier are over a free-kick from a distance just to the left outside the box. Kluivert takes responsibility and goes for a powerful strike with his right foot, but the wall gets in the way.
OVER! Chance for Calvert-Lewin! Onana loops a pass into the box to Doucoure, who pokes the ball to Calvert-Lewin in the middle. He swivels onto his right foot to get a shot away, but his effort deflects over the bar and out for a corner.
Everton are putting plenty of crosses into the box, but Bournemouth are dealing with them brilliantly. Calvert-Lewin keeps drifting to wide positions, but the striker must stay in the middle as he is a physical presence. Doucoure and Onana also provide a threat but have not been found by McNeil.
McNeil has a free-kick on the right corner flag and curls an inviting cross into the middle. Neto comes out with a punch and doesn’t get there, but Zabarnyi heads it behind. Branthwaite gets into a tangle and wants a penalty. However, nothing is given.
Bournemouth have had the better of the opening exchanges, with Everton only showing signs of promise in fleeting moments. Pickford has gone long with a lot of his passes with mixed success.
Tavernier drives a wonderful pass down the right to Kluivert, who is being given plenty of space to roam on the wing. He waits for support to arrive and sets it back to Semenyo. The Ghana international looks to play a one-two in an attempt to move into the box, but the pass is loose, and the chance is gone.
Semenyo has scored four goals in his last five Premier League appearances, as many as his first 30 in the competition beforehand. Six of his last seven league goals for Bournemouth have either equalised (two) or put the Cherries one goal ahead (four) in a match. He has been the player to watch so far and is making the most of the space Godfrey is leaving behind.
Cook's inswinging corner towards the front post is poor, but Doucoure scuffs the clearance and pokes it behind. His following corner finds Semenyo, who directs his header from close range over the bar.
Bournemouth have kept possession well in the last couple of minutes and are doing well to deal with Everton's aggressive press, led by McNeil and Doucoure. Mepham then gifts it to Coleman, who turns past two Cherries players under pressure before offloading the ball.
Semenyo and Godfrey get into a battle in Everton's half, with the Cherries forward getting away from the defender, who goes down and wins a light free-kick. The home fans are not happy with the referee after that decision. Semenyo would have had the chance to drive forward.
Onana gains possession in Everton's half and drives towards the halfway line with possession. Solanke tries to help the defensive unit with some selfless running to try and win the ball, but he drags him back and is shown a needless yellow card.
Onana landed awkwardly after Solanke dragged him to the floor and needs medical treatment.
Onana looks like he is in some pain and is clutching his left shoulder, but he is back on his feet and will be able to continue.
SAVE! What a stop from Neto! Pickford launches the ball forward to put Bournemouth under pressure. Tarkowski gets it stuck under his foot inside the box but flicks a pass back to Calvert-Lewin, who sends a first-time, right-footed strike towards the bottom-right corner. However, Neto reacts quickly and pushes it behind.
WIDE! Poor attempt from McNeil. Neto's goal-kick goes straight to Onana, who starts an Everton attack. The Toffees combine quickly, with Doucoure rolling a pass inside to McNeil. He arrives on the edge of the box but drags a shot wide of the right post.
Everton have won their last two Premier League games against Bournemouth, though both victories have been at Goodison Park. They’ve kept a clean sheet in both wins, having recorded just one shutout in their first 11 league meetings with the Cherries. They have created an xG of 0.39 with their three shots so far, compared to Bournemouth's xG of 0.37.
Adams twists in possession and is tripped by Doucoure on the left just inside Everton's half. Cook whips an inswinging cross towards the back post, but it is just too far ahead of Semenyo. There was too much pace on the ball.
Everton are sticking with their tactics of going long at every opportunity. Pickford is finding Calvert-Lewin almost every time, and the striker wins it in the air, but there has not been enough supporting runs around him.
Doucoure thinks he should be given a free-kick just inside Everton's half, but his claims are ignored by the referee. Onana then slides through Tavernier in frustration and is shown a yellow card.
PENALTY SHOUT! Semenyo retains possession brilliantly on the byline, running back to the edge of the box with the before sliding clever pass through to Adams. He is dragged to the floor by Branthwaite and wants a penalty, but nothing is given. That was risky from Branthwaite.
Everton are giving Bournemouth plenty of free-kicks around their box. Cook goes short this time to Kluivert, who floats a left-footed cross towards Solanke, but his backheel deflects behind off of Coleman.
There will be two minutes of additional time.
HALF-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 0-0 EVERTON
Bournemouth had the better chances in the first half against Everton, but the score is goalless at the Vitality Stadium. Semenyo has scored four goals in his last five outings for the Cherries and went close early on, with his curling strike from the edge of the box getting pushed away by Pickford before Cook smashed the rebound over the bar. Calvert-Lewin then saw a shot defect over the bar before being denied his first Premier League goal in 22 matches by Neto. Tarkowski flicked a pass into his path, but his right-footed strike towards the bottom-right corner was pushed away by the Brazilian. McNeil then dragged a shot from distance well wide of the post before Solanke's backheel deflected behind.
Bournemouth edged the first half and created an xG of 0.49 from their six shots, hitting the target twice. Cook and Adams have played well together in the midfield, with the pair looking to come forward with possession at every opportunity, having 14 final third entries combined. Semenyo has also been electric on the right and is making the most of the space that Godfrey is leaving behind. As for Everton, they have created an xG of 0.39 with their three efforts, hitting the target once. Calvert-Lewin is doing his best in the attack and has won six of his 11 duels, with Pickford going long to the forward at every opportunity, but he needs more support up front.
Everton get the ball rolling again. No changes at half-time.
Everton have failed to score a first-half goal in 20 of their 29 games, only Sheffield United (22) have failed to score more often in the Premier League this season. The Toffees must improve if they want to score in the second half.
McNeil steals possession in Bournemouth's half and tricks his way past a defender before Mepham makes a strong slide tackle to win it back after a loose touch from the winger. McNeil looks like he is about to complain about the tackle before changing his mind.
SAVE! Strong stop from Pickford. Bournemouth gain possession after Godfrey gets caught by Semenyo, who nudges him in the back to win the ball. Cook has a shot blocked on the edge of the box before he rolls it to Tavernier, who drills a low strike towards the bottom-right corner. There is plenty of pace on the striker, but Pickford gets down to push it away.
Everton are on the longest ongoing winless run in the Premier League among current sides in the competition (11 games – drawing five and losing six). Indeed, failure to win at Bournemouth would see the Toffees match their record run without a victory in the Premier League of 12 games from August to October 1994. They have only had once clear chance to score in this contest, with Calvert-Lewin forcing Neto into a strong stop in the first half. Apart from that, there has been very little to get excited about for the visitors.
Solanke does brilliantly to control a ball over the top and flick it past Tarkowski to get down the right side of the box. He has Tavernier in the middle but goes alone and is tackled by Coleman, who makes a good recovery tackle.
Adams gives possession straight to Everton after a poor pass, allowing the visitors to speed away on the counter. Calvert-Lewin dribbles forward and looks for support, but only McNeil is up with him. The Cherries defenders race back to stop him from progressing.
PENALTY SHOUT! Calvert-Lewin controls the ball inside Bournemouth's box and flicks it past Adams, who trips the striker. The Englishman goes down, but doesn’t really appeal the decision from the referee and the play is allowed to continue.
Kluivert races down the right to get to the byline and chips a cross towards the back post. Semenyo is free and drives a volley towards the goal, but Branthwaite makes a brave block.
CHANCE! McNeil plays a one-two with Harrison from a corner, with the former of the two breaking free down the right side of the box. He rolls past a defender and crashes the inside of the post with his strike. The ball then hits Mepham in the middle before Bournemouth clear it behind.
Garner and McNeil combine brilliantly with some one-touch football on the edge of the box before rolling it through to Calvert-Lewin, but the striker cannot get it under control before the flag goes up.
WIDE! Another chance comes and goes for Bournemouth! Kluivert pushes the ball past Branthwaite and lofts a cross into Solanke, who flicks a header back to Tavernier. He is free but drags his volley across the goal and wide of the right post. It was a rushed shot.
Bournemouth make their first change. Kelly has missed most of the season through injury and has made just 15 appearances. He is on at left-back for Kerkez.
GOALLLLL! SOLANKE SCORES! 1-0 BOURNEMOUTH! The hosts have the lead! Semenyo drives forward on the counter and lays a pass down the left to Tavernier, who pokes a pass into Kelly. The substitute then curls a cross into Solanke, who powers his header into the net.
What an impact from Kelly. The substitute makes a surging run down the left and gets an assist with his first couple of touches, whipping a cross straight onto Solanke's head. He makes no mistake from close range and crashes it past Pickford.
Solanke has scored 16 Premier League goals this season, with only Josh King (16 in 2016-17) ever netting the same for Bournemouth in a campaign. A huge 10 of those goals have given the Cherries the lead in a match – the most of a player for any side in the competition in 2023-24, and an all-time Bournemouth record in a season in the division.
Onana turns in possession in Bournemouth's half and has plenty of space ahead of him. However, he doesn’t think before chipping the ball forward, playing it straight out for a goal-kick.
Branthwaite is down after landing awkwardly and needs medical treatment. He is pointing at his knee and looks gutted on the floor.
Branthwaite is back on his feet and will be able to continue. Huge boost for Everton.
Everton make two changes to try and turn the momentum in their favour. Harrison is off after having 31 touches and one shot on the wing, with Young taking his place on the right.
There is also a straight swap in the midfield. Doucoure is replaced after completing just 68 per cent of his passes, with Gomes taking his place.
Kluivert has been an important part of Bournemouth's attack and has added pace to their counters, but is being given a rest. Billing is on to give the Cherries a physical presence.
Tavernier shakes his head on his way off the pitch. Ouattara comes on.
Solanke tries to get away from Tarkowski but is wrestled to the floor by the defender, who is shown a yellow card.
Smith curls a pass down the right to Semenyo, who looks to race onto the long ball. However, Pickford spots the danger and rushes out of the box, taking it away from the forward before clearing it out for a throw-in.
Dyche is bringing on another striker to try and put Bournemouth under pressure. Beto is on for Onana, who is on a yellow card.
Everton have scored just one goal in their last five Premier League away games, despite having 65 shots (14 on target), an xG of 4.8, and seven big chances in this run. In their last away game, they had 23 shots against Man Utd without scoring, their most without a goal in an away league match since August 2010 at Aston Villa (also 23).
Everton win a corner after Zabarnyi heads a cross over the bar. The Toffees take it quickly, but McNeil's cross is cleared up the pitch. Everton retain possession and keep the pressure on, but Beto's weak header from close range is collected by Neto.
WIDE! Billing is in space on the left and whips a delightful cross into a dangerous area. Pickford gets a weak hand on the ball, with it defecting off Solanke and behind for a goal-kick.
Solanke is given a warm reception from the home fans on his way off the pitch after scoring the goal that put them ahead. January addition Unal replaces him up front.
GOAALLLLL! BETO SCORES! 1-1! An equaliser out of nowhere for Everton! McNeil has possession on the left and whips a cross into the middle of the box. It looks easy for Neto to claim, but he drops the ball straight to Beto, who has an easy finish from close range into an open net.
Bournemouth have reacted well since conceding and have had a couple of corners in quick succession. However, they have come to nothing.
There will be six minutes of additional time.
OWN GOAL FROM COLEMAN! 2-1 BOURNEMOUTH! What a mess from the Everton captain! Smith has the ball on the right, and he whips a searching cross into the middle of the box. It goes past Pickford and hits Coleman, who puts it into his own net. Neto will be relieved in the Cherries net after that mistake!
What a horrible moment for Coleman. The Everton captain scores what could be a huge own goal in terms of the Premier League relegation battle in just his third start of the season. Bournemouth have been the better side and have now likely found a deserved winner!
Everton are committing men forward and are loading the box, but the pressure on Bournemouth's goal ends after a foul on Adams.
The six minutes of additional time have already been played. Some Everton fans are leaving, with the hosts demanding the full-time whistle from the referee.
FULL-TIME: BOURNEMOUTH 2-1 EVERTON
Coleman scored a 91st-minute own goal to gift Bournemouth a 2-1 win over Everton at the Vitality Stadium. Semenyo went close early on for the hosts, but his strike from the edge of the box was pushed away by Pickford before Cook crashed over the rebound. Calvert-Lewin was then denied his first goal in 22 outings by Neto, who parried his low strike wide of the post. Bournemouth created an xG of 1.07 in the second half and broke the deadlock through Soanke, who headed in his 16th Premier League goal of the season from close range after latching onto Kelly's cross. Dyche's men struggled after the restart but were handed a leveller by Neto. The goalkeeper fumbled a cross from McNeil, giving Beto the easiest of finishes from close range. However, Bournemouth won it late on through an own goal. Smith's cross from the right was inviting, with Coleman putting it into his net. Everton are winless in their previous 12 league outings and are just three points above the relegation zone. They travel to Newcastle United next. Bournemouth have won three of their last four matches and host Crystal Palace in their next outing. That's all for now, goodbye."	"A resolute defensive display from Arsenal earned the Gunners a point as they played out a goalless draw with Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium, leaving Liverpool top of the table.
City dominated the ball, with 72 per cent possession, but were unable to create many clear-cut chances, with Gabriel and William Saliba superb for Arsenal.
Mikel Arteta's side drop to second, two points behind Liverpool following the Reds' 2-1 win over Brighton & Hove Albion earlier in the day. City are a point further back in third.
How the match unfolded
Pep Guardiola made two changes to the side that beat Newcastle United in the FA Cup a fortnight ago, with Nathan Ake and Kevin De Bruyne replacing Jeremy Doku and the injured Kyle Walker.
First-choice goalkeeper Ederson remained sidelined, so Stefan Ortega continued to deputise, with 38-year-old Scott Carson, who has not made a Premier League appearance since May 2021, named on the bench.
There was just one change for Arsenal - Gabriel Jesus replacing Leandro Trossard up front - while Bukayo Saka was passed fit after missing England's friendlies against Brazil and Belgium.
Man City began the match on the front foot, and had a chance to go in front from a corner through Ake, but the ball hit his shoulder before falling kindly for Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.
Ake limped off shortly after, being replaced by Rico Lewis, and as the first half developed, Arsenal grew into the contest.
Jesus flashed a shot narrowly wide before his jinking run ended in another effort on goal being blocked as it remained goalless at the break.
Saka fizzed into life early in the second half, getting to the byline before sending the ball across goal, but Jesus was unable to get onto the end of it.
Guardiola made a double change on the hour mark, introducing Doku and Jack Grealish, with Arteta responding by bringing on Thomas Partey and Takehiro Tomiyasu for Jorginho and Jakub Kiwior.
The two City substitutes combined to create an opening, with Grealish crossing for Doku, but the Belgian shot well wide.
Erling Haaland was then unable to make the most of a half-chance from a corner, failing to produce a finish at the far post.
Arsenal substitute Trossard forced a save from Ortega at the other end as the Gunners looked to catch City on the break, but neither side were able to find a winner.
One concern for Arteta will have been the sight of Saka limping off during the second half, with Arsenal next in action at home to Luton Town on Wednesday.
City, who only managed one shot on target, were held to their first 0-0 draw in the Premier League since March 2022 against Crystal Palace, ending their run of 75 consecutive league games without any being goalless.

Team_3 were going through a tough run of form at the end of February and had won just one of their last seven Premier League outings after their 1-0 loss to Team_13. However, they have collected seven points from their previous three top-flight outings to move up to 13th position.

Team_9 are embroiled in a relegation battle and are winless in their last 11 Premier League matches. The Toffees went into the international break after a 2-0 loss to Team_14 at Old Trafford, gifting the hosts two first-half penalties whilst failing to score themselves despite creating an xG (expected goals) of 1.61 from their 23 shots.

WIDE! Poor attempt from McNeil. Neto's goal-kick goes straight to Onana, who starts an Team_9 attack. The Toffees combine quickly, with Doucoure rolling a pass inside to McNeil. He arrives on the edge of the box but drags a shot wide of the right post.
Team_9 have won their last two Premier League games against Team_3, though both victories have been at Goodison Park. They’ve kept a clean sheet in both wins, having recorded just one shutout in their first 11 league meetings with the Cherries. They have created an xG of 0.39 with their three shots so far, compared to Team_3 xG of 0.37.
Adams twists in possession and is tripped by Doucoure on the left just inside Team_9 half. Cook whips an inswinging cross towards the back post, but it is just too far ahead of Semenyo. There was too much pace on the ball.
Team_9 are sticking with their tactics of going long at every opportunity. Pickford is finding Calvert-Lewin almost every time, and the striker wins it in the air, but there has not been enough supporting runs around him.
Doucoure thinks he should be given a free-kick just inside Team_9 half, but his claims are ignored by the referee. Onana then slides through Tavernier in frustration and is shown a yellow card.
PENALTY SHOUT! Semenyo retains possession brilliantly on the byline, running back to the edge of the box with the before sliding clever pass through to Adams. He is dragged to the floor by Branthwaite and wants a penalty, but nothing is given. That was risky from Branthwaite.
Team_9 are giving Team_3 plenty of free-kicks around their box. Cook goes short this time to Kluivert, who floats a left-footed cross towards Solanke, but his backheel deflects behind off of Coleman.
There will be two minutes of additional time.
HALF-TIME: Team_3 0-0 Team_9
Team_3 had the better chances in the first half against Team_9, but the score is goalless at the Vitality Stadium. Semenyo has scored four goals in his last five outings for the Cherries and went close early on, with his curling strike from the edge of the box getting pushed away by Pickford before Cook smashed the rebound over the bar. Calvert-Lewin then saw a shot defect over the bar before being denied his first Premier League goal in 22 matches by Neto. Tarkowski flicked a pass into his path, but his right-footed strike towards the bottom-right corner was pushed away by the Brazilian. McNeil then dragged a shot from distance well wide of the post before Solanke's backheel deflected behind.
Team_3 edged the first half and created an xG of 0.49 from their six shots, hitting the target twice. Cook and Adams have played well together in the midfield, with the pair looking to come forward with possession at every opportunity, having 14 final third entries combined. Semenyo has also been electric on the right and is making the most of the space that Godfrey is leaving behind. As for Team_9, they have created an xG of 0.39 with their three efforts, hitting the target once. Calvert-Lewin is doing his best in the attack and has won six of his 11 duels, with Pickford going long to the forward at every opportunity, but he needs more support up front.
Team_9 get the ball rolling again. No changes at half-time.
Team_9 have failed to score a first-half goal in 20 of their 29 games, only Team_17 (22) have failed to score more often in the Premier League this season. The Toffees must improve if they want to score in the second half.
McNeil steals possession in Team_3 half and tricks his way past a defender before Mepham makes a strong slide tackle to win it back after a loose touch from the winger. McNeil looks like he is about to complain about the tackle before changing his mind.
SAVE! Strong stop from Pickford. Team_3 gain possession after Godfrey gets caught by Semenyo, who nudges him in the back to win the ball. Cook has a shot blocked on the edge of the box before he rolls it to Tavernier, who drills a low strike towards the bottom-right corner. There is plenty of pace on the striker, but Pickford gets down to push it away.
Team_9 are on the longest ongoing winless run in the Premier League among current sides in the competition (11 games – drawing five and losing six). Indeed, failure to win at Team_3 would see the Toffees match their record run without a victory in the Premier League of 12 games from August to October 1994. They have only had once clear chance to score in this contest, with Calvert-Lewin forcing Neto into a strong stop in the first half. Apart from that, there has been very little to get excited about for the visitors.
Solanke does brilliantly to control a ball over the top and flick it past Tarkowski to get down the right side of the box. He has Tavernier in the middle but goes alone and is tackled by Coleman, who makes a good recovery tackle.
Adams gives possession straight to Team_9 after a poor pass, allowing the visitors to speed away on the counter. Calvert-Lewin dribbles forward and looks for support, but only McNeil is up with him. The Cherries defenders race back to stop him from progressing.
PENALTY SHOUT! Calvert-Lewin controls the ball inside Team_3 box and flicks it past Adams, who trips the striker. The Englishman goes down, but doesn’t really appeal the decision from the referee and the play is allowed to continue.
Kluivert races down the right to get to the byline and chips a cross towards the back post. Semenyo is free and drives a volley towards the goal, but Branthwaite makes a brave block.
CHANCE! McNeil plays a one-two with Harrison from a corner, with the former of the two breaking free down the right side of the box. He rolls past a defender and crashes the inside of the post with his strike. The ball then hits Mepham in the middle before Team_3 clear it behind.
Garner and McNeil combine brilliantly with some one-touch football on the edge of the box before rolling it through to Calvert-Lewin, but the striker cannot get it under control before the flag goes up.
WIDE! Another chance comes and goes for Team_3! Kluivert pushes the ball past Branthwaite and lofts a cross into Solanke, who flicks a header back to Tavernier. He is free but drags his volley across the goal and wide of the right post. It was a rushed shot.
Team_3 make their first change. Kelly has missed most of the season through injury and has made just 15 appearances. He is on at left-back for Kerkez.
GOALLLLL! SOLANKE SCORES! 1-0 Team_3! The hosts have the lead! Semenyo drives forward on the counter and lays a pass down the left to Tavernier, who pokes a pass into Kelly. The substitute then curls a cross into Solanke, who powers his header into the net.
What an impact from Kelly. The substitute makes a surging run down the left and gets an assist with his first couple of touches, whipping a cross straight onto Solanke's head. He makes no mistake from close range and crashes it past Pickford.
Solanke has scored 16 Premier League goals this season, with only Josh King (16 in 2016-17) ever netting the same for Team_3 in a campaign. A huge 10 of those goals have given the Cherries the lead in a match – the most of a player for any side in the competition in 2023-24, and an all-time Team_3 record in a season in the division.
Onana turns in possession in Team_3 half and has plenty of space ahead of him. However, he doesn’t think before chipping the ball forward, playing it straight out for a goal-kick.
Branthwaite is down after landing awkwardly and needs medical treatment. He is pointing at his knee and looks gutted on the floor.
Branthwaite is back on his feet and will be able to continue. Huge boost for Team_9.
Team_9 make two changes to try and turn the momentum in their favour. Harrison is off after having 31 touches and one shot on the wing, with Young taking his place on the right.
There is also a straight swap in the midfield. Doucoure is replaced after completing just 68 per cent of his passes, with Gomes taking his place.
Kluivert has been an important part of Team_3 attack and has added pace to their counters, but is being given a rest. Billing is on to give the Cherries a physical presence.
Tavernier shakes his head on his way off the pitch. Ouattara comes on.
Solanke tries to get away from Tarkowski but is wrestled to the floor by the defender, who is shown a yellow card.
Smith curls a pass down the right to Semenyo, who looks to race onto the long ball. However, Pickford spots the danger and rushes out of the box, taking it away from the forward before clearing it out for a throw-in.
Dyche is bringing on another striker to try and put Team_3 under pressure. Beto is on for Onana, who is on a yellow card.
Team_9 have scored just one goal in their last five Premier League away games, despite having 65 shots (14 on target), an xG of 4.8, and seven big chances in this run. In their last away game, they had 23 shots against Man Utd without scoring, their most without a goal in an away league match since August 2010 at Team_2 (also 23).
Team_9 win a corner after Zabarnyi heads a cross over the bar. The Toffees take it quickly, but McNeil's cross is cleared up the pitch. Team_9 retain possession and keep the pressure on, but Beto's weak header from close range is collected by Neto.
WIDE! Billing is in space on the left and whips a delightful cross into a dangerous area. Pickford gets a weak hand on the ball, with it defecting off Solanke and behind for a goal-kick.
Solanke is given a warm reception from the home fans on his way off the pitch after scoring the goal that put them ahead. January addition Unal replaces him up front.
GOAALLLLL! BETO SCORES! 1-1! An equaliser out of nowhere for Team_9! McNeil has possession on the left and whips a cross into the middle of the box. It looks easy for Neto to claim, but he drops the ball straight to Beto, who has an easy finish from close range into an open net.
Team_3 have reacted well since conceding and have had a couple of corners in quick succession. However, they have come to nothing.
There will be six minutes of additional time.
OWN GOAL FROM COLEMAN! 2-1 Team_3! What a mess from the Team_9 captain! Smith has the ball on the right, and he whips a searching cross into the middle of the box. It goes past Pickford and hits Coleman, who puts it into his own net. Neto will be relieved in the Cherries net after that mistake!
What a horrible moment for Coleman. The Team_9 captain scores what could be a huge own goal in terms of the Premier League relegation battle in just his third start of the season. Team_3 have been the better side and have now likely found a deserved winner!
Team_9 are committing men forward and are loading the box, but the pressure on Team_3 goal ends after a foul on Adams.
The six minutes of additional time have already been played. Some Team_9 fans are leaving, with the hosts demanding the full-time whistle from the referee.
FULL-TIME: Team_3 2-1 Team_9
Coleman scored a 91st-minute own goal to gift Team_3 a 2-1 win over Team_9 at the Vitality Stadium. Semenyo went close early on for the hosts, but his strike from the edge of the box was pushed away by Pickford before Cook crashed over the rebound. Calvert-Lewin was then denied his first goal in 22 outings by Neto, who parried his low strike wide of the post. Team_3 created an xG of 1.07 in the second half and broke the deadlock through Soanke, who headed in his 16th Premier League goal of the season from close range after latching onto Kelly's cross. Dyche's men struggled after the restart but were handed a leveller by Neto. The goalkeeper fumbled a cross from McNeil, giving Beto the easiest of finishes from close range. However, Team_3 won it late on through an own goal. Smith's cross from the right was inviting, with Coleman putting it into his net. Team_9 are winless in their previous 12 league outings and are just three points above the relegation zone. They travel to Team_15 next. Team_3 have won three of their last four matches and host Team_8 in their next outing. That's all for now, goodbye."	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93425	Luton	Liverpool	2023-11-05	Kenilworth Road, Luton	11049.0	Andy Madley	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Sheffield United and Manchester United.
Before looking ahead to this game, it is important to note Manchester United will be wearing black armbands to pay their respects to club legend Bobby Charlton, who died at the age of 86 on Saturday. Charlton – a key figure in England’s 1966 World Cup victory – remains one of the most significant players in the Red Devils' history, playing 758 games for the club and winning the European Cup in 1968.
The Blades have endured a tough start to their top-flight return, sitting at the bottom of the table. Paul Heckingbottom’s side are yet to win in the league and have just one point after eight games. Sheffield United were 3-1 losers at Fulham in their last outing before the international break, with improvements desperately needed ahead of this Bramall Lane clash.
Manchester United were saved by Scott McTominay’s stoppage-time double against Brentford, salvaging a 2-1 victory having been on the brink of another chastening defeat at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have underwhelmed this campaign, already trailing fourth-placed Liverpool by five points ahead of this weekend’s fixtures, after winning four and losing as many from their opening eight games.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (4-3-1-2): Wes Foderingham; Jayden Bogle, Auston Trusty, Jack Robinson, Luke Thomas; Gustavo Hamer, Vinicius Souza, Oliver Norwood; James McAtee; Oliver McBurnie, Cameron Archer.
SUBSTITUTES: John Fleck, Rhian Brewster, Benie Traore, Ben Osborn, Anis Ben Slimane, Ryan One, Jordan Amissah, Femi Seriki, Jili Buyabu.
MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot; Sofyan Amrabat, Scott McTominay; Antony, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Rasmus Hojlund.
SUBSTITUTES: Altay Bayindir, Mason Mount, Anthony Martial, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho, Raphael Varane, Facundo Pellistri, Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri.
Heckingbottom makes two enforced alterations from the defeat to Fulham. Anel Ahmedhodzic and Chris Basham both miss out through injury and are replaced by McAtee and Robinson.
Erik ten Hag opts for two changes to his last starting XI, with two-goal hero McTominay coming in for the injured Casemiro. Mount also drops down to the bench as Antony takes his place on the right-hand side, joining Fernandes and Rashford in behind Hojlund. Kick-off will soon be upon us in Sheffield!
Fernandes carries out and places down a wreath in honour of the late Bobby Charlton, a figure embroiled forever in Manchester United and England history, before a well-observed moment of applause. Referee Michael Oliver then gets this Premier League clash under way!
Antony is felled early on by a sliding Souza. A capacity crowd inside Bramall Lane are unimpressed with that decision as Manchester United restart with a free-kick on their right-hand side.
Archer is hustled off the ball by McTominay, who is penalised as the Blades are awarded a left-wing free-kick. Norwood whips the set-piece towards the near post, where Fernandes heads comfortably clear.
CHANCE! Smart link-up play sees Archer spring in behind the Red Devils' defence before Hamer unleashes a right-footed strike that deflects off Maguire. The loose ball falls to McBurnie, who can only prod straight at Onana when completely unmarked inside the area. What a chance for the Blades!
The hosts have started the better of the two sides, enticing the Bramall Lane faithful into making some noise. McBurnie and Archer are finding pockets of space and dragging Maguire and Evans all over the place. Can Ten Hag's side settle?
Maguire and Onana offer the visitors a brief scare with some intricate passes between the pair at the back, but they manage to escape the Sheffield United press. Maguire, of course, is returning to his boyhood Blades and will be keen to impress.
Fernandes looks to slide Antony in down the right flank but the winger is penalised for nudging Thomas to the ground from behind. The former Ajax man did not need to commit that foul in what was a promising position for the away side.
Manchester City loanee McAtee darts inside but his cross is headed away by Maguire before McTominay protects his back four. Norwood soon regains possession but cannot do anything with the ball from a deep central position.
Maguire clumsily bundles through the back of the energetic Archer, who wins a free-kick inside Manchester United's half. Norwood swings the set-piece towards the near post but Fernandes again clears as the first line of defence.
Another inviting McAtee cross from the right-hand side causes chaos inside the Manchester United area. McBurnie looks to bring the bouncing ball down before falling to the ground, but referee Oliver is far from interested in the appeals for a penalty.
SAVE! Rashford has acres of space to maraud down the left flank before cutting back for Fernandes, who plays across to his right to Antony. The Brazilian winger curls a left-footed shot towards the bottom-left corner, where Foderingham makes a routine save low down to his right.
Rashford's left-wing centre for Hojlund is cleared by Thomas, but only as far as Antony. The Red Devils' attacker takes a first-time left-footed volley that is always going wide to the right of goal.
Hamer whips a dangerous delivery towards the far post, where McBurnie looks to jump above Evans. Onana comes out to command his area, claiming the cross before clattering into the Northern Ireland centre-back, who stays down for a moment or two to regain his breath after that collision.
Onana goes down off the ball and requires some medical attention. The Manchester United goalkeeper had clashed with his own player, Evans, in an aerial challenge just a few minutes ago. After a brief pause, play resumes with a Sheffield United throw-in.
Thomas seizes on possession before dancing into the area on the left-hand side and seeing a left-footed cross deflected behind for a corner by Dalot.
McTominay opts to clear long after Hamer's corner is worked back towards the box by McAtee. It is hard to tell which team is struggling at the bottom of the table so far, such has been the nature of Manchester United's toothless performance.
CLOSE! Dalot's loose pass sets Archer free before the former Aston Villa forward bursts down the middle and aims a right-footed drive towards the bottom-left corner. Onana manages to parry away an unconvincing save before the visitors clear behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.
Heckingbottom has lost 14 of his 18 Premier League games as a manager (78 per cent - W3 D1). Among managers to take charge of 10+ games in the competition, only Jan Siewert (80 per cent - 12 defeats in 15) has a poorer loss ratio. His side have started well at Bramall Lane, however.
Maguire is fortunate to get away with a pull back on Archer's shirt before Souza clatters into the centre-back with a sliding challenge. The former Sheffield United defender stays down for a brief moment but is fine to continue without receiving medical attention.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! 1-0 MANCHESTER UNITED! It's McTominay, the two-goal hero against Brentford, who strikes again! Lindelof works an offload inside to Fernandes, who loops a pass from the edge of the area into the box. McTominay races onto the high ball, chesting down before rifling a right-footed volley into the bottom-right corner. Foderingham is unmoved as Sheffield United fall behind.
Fernandes takes the credit for the assist with a deft flick into the area before McTominay makes a goal out of nothing with a fine volley.
Completely against the run of play, Manchester United are ahead. Onana claims a comfortable delivery from the right-hand side and Bramall Lane has been silenced. Can the Blades find a way back?
PENALTY TO SHEFFIELD UNITED! Minutes after sending Manchester United into the lead, McTominay is penalised for handling inside the area and Sheffield United are awarded a spot-kick. McAtee aims a hopeful ball towards the near post, where the Scotland midfielder's arm is dangling to his side and referee Oliver immediately points to the spot! The VAR will take a look at this decision first...
THE DECISION STANDS! The VAR reviews the footage, taking a while to decide whether McTominay has handled inside the area before confirming the on-field decision can stand. It will be McBurnie over the penalty...
GOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLL! 1-1 AS SHEFFIELD UNITED HIT BACK IMMEDIATELY! McBurnie hovers over the spot-kick from 12 yards before hammering a right-footed strike in off the right post. Onana dives the right way but cannot stop the forward's thunderous effort from cannoning off the woodwork and into the back of the net!
From hero to zero, McTominay will be wondering whether he could have kept his arm out the way when moving to block McAtee's cross. Manchester United can hardly have any complaints and the Blades are deservedly level.
Dalot is caught late by a loose Hamer arm as the former Coventry City midfielder blocks the full-back's run. The VAR has a quick check of the challenge before deciding no further punishment is required for the Sheffield United man.
Thomas drags down Antony as the winger races away down the right flank. Unsurprisingly, the full-back is shown a yellow card for his cynical intervention.
SO CLOSE! Antony dances inside from the right-hand side and angles a cross towards the back post, where Rashford volleys across the face of goal. All Hojlund has to do is make contact for his first Premier League goal, but the Manchester United forward cannot quite reach the chance and the Blades escape without punishment.
Rashford speeds back to do his defensive duties but fells McAtee, allowing Sheffield United a free-kick wide on the right flank. The hosts go short before Lindelof clears a cross at the near post.
CHANCE! Archer produces an excellent run to go past both Dalot and Amrabat before exchanging a one-two with McBurnie. However, Onana races out and slides to smother Archer's right-footed effort, sparing the blushes of a torrid Manchester United defensive unit.
Norwood needlessly hacks at the ankles of Fernandes and Manchester United win a free-kick in a great position just outside the area. Fernandes and Rashford will fancy their chances here.
OFF THE BAR! Fernandes takes the free-kick responsibility and curls a right-footed strike over the Sheffield United wall. Foderingham is unmoved and watches as the whipped effort clips the crossbar on its way behind for a goal-kick. The Blades are fortunate to have escaped there!
Trusty joins Thomas in the book after jumping to block Rashford from taking a quick throw-in on the left flank. That was avoidable for the centre-back, who will now need to be careful on a yellow card.
There will be six minutes of additional time to end this half, owing to the two goals, the VAR checking the penalty decision and injuries to Maguire, Onana and Evans.
SAVE! Fernandes finds a pocket of space outside the area before offloading to Rashford, who cuts inside and drills a right-footed shot at goal. A loose ball falls to the feet of Hojlund, whose right-footed prod is saved well by the onrushing Foderingham. Another great chance for the Red Devils goes amiss.
Sheffield United are camped inside their own half as Manchester United look to ramp up the pressure. However, McTominay strays offside and the Blades will regain their breath as the half-time whistle approaches.
HALF-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 1-1 MANCHESTER UNITED
Sheffield United have battled well and are deservedly level at 1-1 heading into half-time against Manchester United at Bramall Lane. McTominay opened the scoring with a fine piece of skill, chesting down before smashing a volley past the helpless Foderingham. However, the Scotland international conceded a penalty just four minutes later, allowing McBurnie to restore parity with a thunderous spot-kick. Fernandes clipped a free-kick against the crossbar shortly afterwards near the conclusion of an end-to-end first half.
It is a familiar story for both managers. Ten Hag's side have struggled to get going away from home in the Premier League once again, and were perhaps fortunate to take the lead against the run of play. Heckingbottom's Blades raced out the blocks but could not make their dominance count, although they remain in the game heading into the second period.
Referee Oliver gets the second half under way! A repeat of the first 45 minutes would make for a real spectacle under the lights at Bramall Lane.
Rashford looks for a way past Bogle but Sheffield United get two men behind the ball to deal with the danger. The England winger keeps finding space on the left-hand side but has not found a way to test Foderingham as of yet.
CHANCE! McAtee wanders inside before offloading to Norwood, who fires a left-footed effort towards the top-left corner. The shot looks to be rising over the bar but Onana makes sure by tipping behind for a corner.
Lindelof clears the first corner behind for another set-piece, which is initially delayed as referee Oliver wants a word with Maguire and Trusty, who were grappling inside the area. Norwood then delivers but fails to find a team-mate and Manchester United settle for a throw-in.
McBurnie, who scored the first-half equaliser, is limping around and has to come off for Brewster.
SO CLOSE! Brewster is immediately involved and smashes a swerving right-footed effort from range. Onana's feet are all over the place but the goalkeeper manages to parry away another unconvincing save. McAtee wants the follow-up but the ball loops over his head and the Red Devils clear the danger.
The VAR has a quick check of Maguire's challenge on McAtee from Brewster's shot, but deems the centre-back has not fouled the leaping Sheffield United attacker. That would have been harsh on the former Blades defender.
Fernandes and McTominay look to exchange passes on the edge of the area before the latter's shot is deflected behind for a corner on the left-hand side. Amrabat receives a short corner but his cross goes straight behind for a goal-kick.
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY! Foderingham fails to find Trusty with a poor pass, allowing Rashford to burst forward towards the area. The England international offloads to Hojlund, who has tons of time but can only fire a weak left-footed strike straight at the Sheffield United goalkeeper.
WIDE! The Manchester United fans cannot believe their side are not ahead. Antony bursts inside before finding Fernandes, who unselfishly offloads to his left for Rashford. The England international angles a left-footed shot towards the bottom-right corner but drags a great opportunity wide of the target.
Ten Hag's visitors are in control of this second half but have yet to find the breakthrough they desire. Heckingbottom's side appear intent on survival only at the moment as the subdued Bramall Lane crowd watch on.
Souza is the third Sheffield United name to go into the book after a late and ugly sliding lunge on Antony, who stays down clutching his ankle after a hefty challenge.
Hojlund's frustrating outing is over as Ten Hag sends Martial on up top.
Eriksen replaces McTominay, too, as the Red Devils shuffle their midfield.
Garnacho is the third part of a triple change as Antony makes way.
Sheffield United have conceded two or more goals in each of their last seven Premier League games (21 conceded, three per game). There have been just eight occasions of a side shipping two or more goals in eight straight matches within a single season in the competition, most recently West Brom in February 2021 (8) – a run that the Baggies ended by drawing 1-1 with Manchester United. At present, the Blades' defence has only been breached once.
Hamer hits a hopeful right-footed strike that is always rising over the crossbar from range. Onana quickly gets play restarted with a short goal-kick.
OFF THE WOODWORK! Sheffield United deal with Fernandes' right-sided corner and then Eriksen's second delivery towards the area. However, Amrabat receives possession on the edge of the box before arrowing a right-footed piledriver that crashes off the right-hand post. So close for the Red Devils!
Eriksen whips an aimless free-kick to no team-mate inside the Sheffield United area. Ten Hag's visitors have just over 20 minutes to find a goal.
Archer bursts through the middle after McAtee's pass but Amrabat is swiftly on the scene to snuff out any danger. The Sheffield United forward looks the Blades' best hope of another goal at Bramall Lane.
Since the start of last season, no side has seen more Premier League goals scored by substitutes (excluding own goals) than Manchester United (15, level with Brighton), with McTominay scoring a brace from the bench last time out against Brentford. Can another replacement find the winner for the Red Devils?
Maguire and Fernandes cannot find an opening down the right-hand side, such is the resilience and organisation of the Sheffield United backline. Ten Hag's substitutes are yet to have the desired impact either yet.
GOOOOOOALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! 2-1 MANCHESTER UNITED! The Red Devils have their breakthrough and it comes from an unlikely source. Lindelof works a pass inside from the left flank to Dalot, who curls a right-footed strike into the top-right corner from outside the area. Foderingham got a hand on the effort but failed to keep it out!
Defender to defender creates the Red Devils' second goal, as Lindelof plays a pass inside from the left flank for Dalot to whip a fine finish past Foderingham.
Manchester City loanee McAtee is brought off for Osborn.
Martial aims to find space on the right-hand side but Robinson is soon across to deal with the danger. However, the clearance finds Hamer, who is flagged for offside and Manchester United soon regain possession.
Evans is the first Manchester United player to be shown a yellow card after hacking Archer down on the left wing.
Evans stays down after the foul on Archer, meaning Ten Hag must send on Varane as his replacement.
Hamer also makes way for Traore.
Norwood fails to beat the first man with his left-sided free-kick before Thomas whips another cross in. Traore lurks inside the area before Manchester United turn the ball behind for a corner.
Norwood's corner is cleared at the far post before Garnacho speeds away down the right flank. However, the winger cannot find a pass to Fernandes before the Blades win a free-kick near the touchline for a Lindelof foul.
Souza's tackle accidentally sets Garnacho free before the Manchester United attacker sees a left-footed strike deflected behind for a corner. The Red Devils will be in no rush to take this one.
WIDE! Fernandes works a smart pass inside before Garnacho fires a low right-footed drive towards the bottom-left corner. Foderingham is unsighted but watches gratefully as the effort goes just wide to his right.
Mount comes on for Rashford as the Red Devils look to see out the closing minutes at Bramall Lane.
Trusty makes a perfectly timed sliding challenge to dispossess Martial, who was aiming to burst through the middle of the pitch. Norwood then crosses towards the back post before Fernandes intervenes in front of Thomas.
WHAT A MISS! Martial steals possession from Norwood before rolling through for Garnacho, who somehow slides a right-footed strike wide with just Foderingham to beat. A belated offside flag spares the winger's blushes, but the VAR would surely have checked that decision. There are five minutes of additional time remaining.
A throw-in on the left-hand side allows Lindelof and Eriksen to eat into some more valuable seconds. Manchester United have just over two minutes to close out the victory.
A needless Bogle foul on Garnacho gives the visitors a free-kick on the left flank. The Manchester United supporters laud their nimble winger, who is bizarrely taunted by a Sheffield United supporter who made it down to pitchside.
FULL-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 1-2 MANCHESTER UNITED
Manchester United pay tribute to club legend Bobby Charlton, who died on Saturday at the age of 86, with a battling 2-1 victory over Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. McTominay's first-half opener was soon cancelled out by McBurnie's penalty, which was conceded by the Scotland international shortly after his goal at the other end. The Red Devils toiled in the second half and went close through Amrabat before Dalot's curling finish snatched all three points on the road. The victory lifts Ten Hag's side up to eighth, while Heckingbottom's men remain bottom of the Premier League and still without a win this season on their top-flight return. The Blades visit high-flying Arsenal next Saturday before Manchester United host rivals Manchester City the day after. The Red Devils are also in Champions League action against Copenhagen in midweek. That is all for now, until next time – goodbye!"	"Luis Diaz scored an equaliser in the fifth minute of stoppage time as Liverpool denied Luton Town a first home win in the Premier League. 
Tahith Chong's 80th-minute goal had Luton on course for an historic victory but substitute Diaz bundled in a far-post leveller and revealed a message of support to his family following recent reports of his father's kidnapping in Colombia.  
Diaz's goal was Liverpool's 24th and final shot of a fantastic match, with Darwin Nunez accounting for nine of Liverpool's attempts, the most by any player in a match this season, and somehow missing a big chance from just three yards out.
Liverpool started on the front foot, with Nunez having four shots in the first 15 minutes, most notably seeing a long-range shot saved by Thomas Kaminski before striking the bar from inside the box following a terrific long pass by Trent Alexander-Arnold.
Luton surrendered possession but were a regular threat on the counter-attack, with Issa Kabore firing over the bar after Chiedoze Ogbene surged away from Alexander-Arnold on the wing.
Mohamed Salah then blazed over himself from a decent position, before Kaminski brilliantly denied Diogo Jota at his near post as the match reached half-time goalless. 
The first chance of the second half fell to Luton. Again, Ogbene beat Alexander-Arnold, running half the length of the pitch and beating another player before his pass ricocheted to Carlton Morris, who was thwarted by Alisson.
Liverpool then had a huge chance to break the deadlock in the 70th minute. Alexander-Arnold served up a huge opportunity for Salah but the Egyptian mistimed his close-range header. It inadvertently went to Nunez, who from just three yards out blazed over the bar.
The Reds continued to come forward and Kaminski saved from Nunez and Ryan Gravenberch, before Luton struck on the counter-attack.
Ross Barkley led a break from the edge of his own box and passed wide to Kabore, whose brilliant cross found Chong to finish low past Alisson for his first Premier League goal. 
Liverpool threw everything at it in search of an equaliser and were relieved to see eight minutes of stoppage time, which they made count. 
Harvey Elliott crossed to fellow substitute Diaz to head in at the back post and break Luton's resistance. 
It stops Luton from moving two points clear of the relegation zone, but does take them up to 17th place, above AFC Bournemouth on goal difference. 
Liverpool miss the chance to go second but do leapfrog Arsenal into third, with 24 points, three behind leaders Manchester City. They will, however, be six points behind the leaders if Tottenham Hotspur beat Chelsea on Monday. 
Liverpool have failed to win any of their last four Premier League away matches against promoted sides (D2 L2), their longest away winless run against such opposition since March 2012.
Darwin Nunez had nine shots in this match. No player has had more in a Premier League match this season. It is the most by a Liverpool player in a Premier League match without scoring since Roberto Firmino v Man Utd in December 2018."		Team_11	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_17 and Team_14.
Before looking ahead to this game, it is important to note Team_14 will be wearing black armbands to pay their respects to club legend Bobby Charlton, who died at the age of 86 on Saturday. Charlton – a key figure in England’s 1966 World Cup victory – remains one of the most significant players in the Red Devils' history, playing 758 games for the club and winning the European Cup in 1968.
The Blades have endured a tough start to their top-flight return, sitting at the bottom of the table. Paul Heckingbottom’s side are yet to win in the league and have just one point after eight games. Team_17 were 3-1 losers at Team_10 in their last outing before the international break, with improvements desperately needed ahead of this Bramall Lane clash.
Team_14 were saved by Scott McTominay’s stoppage-time double against Team_4, salvaging a 2-1 victory having been on the brink of another chastening defeat at Old Trafford. The Red Devils have underwhelmed this campaign, already trailing fourth-placed Team_11 by five points ahead of this weekend’s fixtures, after winning four and losing as many from their opening eight games.
Team_17 (4-3-1-2): Wes Foderingham; Jayden Bogle, Auston Trusty, Jack Robinson, Luke Thomas; Gustavo Hamer, Vinicius Souza, Oliver Norwood; James McAtee; Oliver McBurnie, Cameron Archer.
SUBSTITUTES: John Fleck, Rhian Brewster, Benie Traore, Ben Osborn, Anis Ben Slimane, Ryan One, Jordan Amissah, Femi Seriki, Jili Buyabu.
Team_14 (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Victor Lindelof, Jonny Evans, Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot; Sofyan Amrabat, Scott McTominay; Antony, Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford; Rasmus Hojlund.
SUBSTITUTES: Altay Bayindir, Mason Mount, Anthony Martial, Christian Eriksen, Alejandro Garnacho, Raphael Varane, Facundo Pellistri, Donny van de Beek, Hannibal Mejbri.
Heckingbottom makes two enforced alterations from the defeat to Team_10. Anel Ahmedhodzic and Chris Basham both miss out through injury and are replaced by McAtee and Robinson.
Erik ten Hag opts for two changes to his last starting XI, with two-goal hero McTominay coming in for the injured Casemiro. Mount also drops down to the bench as Antony takes his place on the right-hand side, joining Fernandes and Rashford in behind Hojlund. Kick-off will soon be upon us in Sheffield!
Fernandes carries out and places down a wreath in honour of the late Bobby Charlton, a figure embroiled forever in Team_14 and England history, before a well-observed moment of applause. Referee Michael Oliver then gets this Premier League clash under way!
Antony is felled early on by a sliding Souza. A capacity crowd inside Bramall Lane are unimpressed with that decision as Team_14 restart with a free-kick on their right-hand side.
Archer is hustled off the ball by McTominay, who is penalised as the Blades are awarded a left-wing free-kick. Norwood whips the set-piece towards the near post, where Fernandes heads comfortably clear.
CHANCE! Smart link-up play sees Archer spring in behind the Red Devils' defence before Hamer unleashes a right-footed strike that deflects off Maguire. The loose ball falls to McBurnie, who can only prod straight at Onana when completely unmarked inside the area. What a chance for the Blades!
The hosts have started the better of the two sides, enticing the Bramall Lane faithful into making some noise. McBurnie and Archer are finding pockets of space and dragging Maguire and Evans all over the place. Can Ten Hag's side settle?
Maguire and Onana offer the visitors a brief scare with some intricate passes between the pair at the back, but they manage to escape the Team_17 press. Maguire, of course, is returning to his boyhood Blades and will be keen to impress.
Fernandes looks to slide Antony in down the right flank but the winger is penalised for nudging Thomas to the ground from behind. The former Ajax man did not need to commit that foul in what was a promising position for the away side.
Team_13 loanee McAtee darts inside but his cross is headed away by Maguire before McTominay protects his back four. Norwood soon regains possession but cannot do anything with the ball from a deep central position.
Maguire clumsily bundles through the back of the energetic Archer, who wins a free-kick inside Team_14 half. Norwood swings the set-piece towards the near post but Fernandes again clears as the first line of defence.
Another inviting McAtee cross from the right-hand side causes chaos inside the Team_14 area. McBurnie looks to bring the bouncing ball down before falling to the ground, but referee Oliver is far from interested in the appeals for a penalty.
SAVE! Rashford has acres of space to maraud down the left flank before cutting back for Fernandes, who plays across to his right to Antony. The Brazilian winger curls a left-footed shot towards the bottom-left corner, where Foderingham makes a routine save low down to his right.
Rashford's left-wing centre for Hojlund is cleared by Thomas, but only as far as Antony. The Red Devils' attacker takes a first-time left-footed volley that is always going wide to the right of goal.
Hamer whips a dangerous delivery towards the far post, where McBurnie looks to jump above Evans. Onana comes out to command his area, claiming the cross before clattering into the Northern Ireland centre-back, who stays down for a moment or two to regain his breath after that collision.
Onana goes down off the ball and requires some medical attention. The Team_14 goalkeeper had clashed with his own player, Evans, in an aerial challenge just a few minutes ago. After a brief pause, play resumes with a Team_17 throw-in.
Thomas seizes on possession before dancing into the area on the left-hand side and seeing a left-footed cross deflected behind for a corner by Dalot.
McTominay opts to clear long after Hamer's corner is worked back towards the box by McAtee. It is hard to tell which team is struggling at the bottom of the table so far, such has been the nature of Team_14 toothless performance.
CLOSE! Dalot's loose pass sets Archer free before the former Team_2 forward bursts down the middle and aims a right-footed drive towards the bottom-left corner. Onana manages to parry away an unconvincing save before the visitors clear behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.
Heckingbottom has lost 14 of his 18 Premier League games as a manager (78 per cent - W3 D1). Among managers to take charge of 10+ games in the competition, only Jan Siewert (80 per cent - 12 defeats in 15) has a poorer loss ratio. His side have started well at Bramall Lane, however.
Maguire is fortunate to get away with a pull back on Archer's shirt before Souza clatters into the centre-back with a sliding challenge. The former Team_17 defender stays down for a brief moment but is fine to continue without receiving medical attention.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLL! 1-0 Team_14! It's McTominay, the two-goal hero against Team_4, who strikes again! Lindelof works an offload inside to Fernandes, who loops a pass from the edge of the area into the box. McTominay races onto the high ball, chesting down before rifling a right-footed volley into the bottom-right corner. Foderingham is unmoved as Team_17 fall behind.
Fernandes takes the credit for the assist with a deft flick into the area before McTominay makes a goal out of nothing with a fine volley.
Completely against the run of play, Team_14 are ahead. Onana claims a comfortable delivery from the right-hand side and Bramall Lane has been silenced. Can the Blades find a way back?
PENALTY TO Team_17! Minutes after sending Team_14 into the lead, McTominay is penalised for handling inside the area and Team_17 are awarded a spot-kick. McAtee aims a hopeful ball towards the near post, where the Scotland midfielder's arm is dangling to his side and referee Oliver immediately points to the spot! The VAR will take a look at this decision first...
THE DECISION STANDS! The VAR reviews the footage, taking a while to decide whether McTominay has handled inside the area before confirming the on-field decision can stand. It will be McBurnie over the penalty...
GOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLL! 1-1 AS Team_17 HIT BACK IMMEDIATELY! McBurnie hovers over the spot-kick from 12 yards before hammering a right-footed strike in off the right post. Onana dives the right way but cannot stop the forward's thunderous effort from cannoning off the woodwork and into the back of the net!
From hero to zero, McTominay will be wondering whether he could have kept his arm out the way when moving to block McAtee's cross. Team_14 can hardly have any complaints and the Blades are deservedly level.
Dalot is caught late by a loose Hamer arm as the former Coventry City midfielder blocks the full-back's run. The VAR has a quick check of the challenge before deciding no further punishment is required for the Team_17 man.
Thomas drags down Antony as the winger races away down the right flank. Unsurprisingly, the full-back is shown a yellow card for his cynical intervention.
SO CLOSE! Antony dances inside from the right-hand side and angles a cross towards the back post, where Rashford volleys across the face of goal. All Hojlund has to do is make contact for his first Premier League goal, but the Team_14 forward cannot quite reach the chance and the Blades escape without punishment.
Rashford speeds back to do his defensive duties but fells McAtee, allowing Team_17 a free-kick wide on the right flank. The hosts go short before Lindelof clears a cross at the near post.
CHANCE! Archer produces an excellent run to go past both Dalot and Amrabat before exchanging a one-two with McBurnie. However, Onana races out and slides to smother Archer's right-footed effort, sparing the blushes of a torrid Team_14 defensive unit.
Norwood needlessly hacks at the ankles of Fernandes and Team_14 win a free-kick in a great position just outside the area. Fernandes and Rashford will fancy their chances here.
OFF THE BAR! Fernandes takes the free-kick responsibility and curls a right-footed strike over the Team_17 wall. Foderingham is unmoved and watches as the whipped effort clips the crossbar on its way behind for a goal-kick. The Blades are fortunate to have escaped there!
Trusty joins Thomas in the book after jumping to block Rashford from taking a quick throw-in on the left flank. That was avoidable for the centre-back, who will now need to be careful on a yellow card.
There will be six minutes of additional time to end this half, owing to the two goals, the VAR checking the penalty decision and injuries to Maguire, Onana and Evans.
SAVE! Fernandes finds a pocket of space outside the area before offloading to Rashford, who cuts inside and drills a right-footed shot at goal. A loose ball falls to the feet of Hojlund, whose right-footed prod is saved well by the onrushing Foderingham. Another great chance for the Red Devils goes amiss.
Team_17 are camped inside their own half as Team_14 look to ramp up the pressure. However, McTominay strays offside and the Blades will regain their breath as the half-time whistle approaches.
HALF-TIME: Team_17 1-1 Team_14
Team_17 have battled well and are deservedly level at 1-1 heading into half-time against Team_14 at Bramall Lane. McTominay opened the scoring with a fine piece of skill, chesting down before smashing a volley past the helpless Foderingham. However, the Scotland international conceded a penalty just four minutes later, allowing McBurnie to restore parity with a thunderous spot-kick. Fernandes clipped a free-kick against the crossbar shortly afterwards near the conclusion of an end-to-end first half.
It is a familiar story for both managers. Ten Hag's side have struggled to get going away from home in the Premier League once again, and were perhaps fortunate to take the lead against the run of play. Heckingbottom's Blades raced out the blocks but could not make their dominance count, although they remain in the game heading into the second period.
Referee Oliver gets the second half under way! A repeat of the first 45 minutes would make for a real spectacle under the lights at Bramall Lane.
Rashford looks for a way past Bogle but Team_17 get two men behind the ball to deal with the danger. The England winger keeps finding space on the left-hand side but has not found a way to test Foderingham as of yet.
CHANCE! McAtee wanders inside before offloading to Norwood, who fires a left-footed effort towards the top-left corner. The shot looks to be rising over the bar but Onana makes sure by tipping behind for a corner.
Lindelof clears the first corner behind for another set-piece, which is initially delayed as referee Oliver wants a word with Maguire and Trusty, who were grappling inside the area. Norwood then delivers but fails to find a team-mate and Team_14 settle for a throw-in.
McBurnie, who scored the first-half equaliser, is limping around and has to come off for Brewster.
SO CLOSE! Brewster is immediately involved and smashes a swerving right-footed effort from range. Onana's feet are all over the place but the goalkeeper manages to parry away another unconvincing save. McAtee wants the follow-up but the ball loops over his head and the Red Devils clear the danger.
The VAR has a quick check of Maguire's challenge on McAtee from Brewster's shot, but deems the centre-back has not fouled the leaping Team_17 attacker. That would have been harsh on the former Blades defender.
Fernandes and McTominay look to exchange passes on the edge of the area before the latter's shot is deflected behind for a corner on the left-hand side. Amrabat receives a short corner but his cross goes straight behind for a goal-kick.
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY! Foderingham fails to find Trusty with a poor pass, allowing Rashford to burst forward towards the area. The England international offloads to Hojlund, who has tons of time but can only fire a weak left-footed strike straight at the Team_17 goalkeeper.
WIDE! The Team_14 fans cannot believe their side are not ahead. Antony bursts inside before finding Fernandes, who unselfishly offloads to his left for Rashford. The England international angles a left-footed shot towards the bottom-right corner but drags a great opportunity wide of the target.
Ten Hag's visitors are in control of this second half but have yet to find the breakthrough they desire. Heckingbottom's side appear intent on survival only at the moment as the subdued Bramall Lane crowd watch on.
Souza is the third Team_17 name to go into the book after a late and ugly sliding lunge on Antony, who stays down clutching his ankle after a hefty challenge.
Hojlund's frustrating outing is over as Ten Hag sends Martial on up top.
Eriksen replaces McTominay, too, as the Red Devils shuffle their midfield.
Garnacho is the third part of a triple change as Antony makes way.
Team_17 have conceded two or more goals in each of their last seven Premier League games (21 conceded, three per game). There have been just eight occasions of a side shipping two or more goals in eight straight matches within a single season in the competition, most recently West Brom in February 2021 (8) – a run that the Baggies ended by drawing 1-1 with Team_14. At present, the Blades' defence has only been breached once.
Hamer hits a hopeful right-footed strike that is always rising over the crossbar from range. Onana quickly gets play restarted with a short goal-kick.
OFF THE WOODWORK! Team_17 deal with Fernandes' right-sided corner and then Eriksen's second delivery towards the area. However, Amrabat receives possession on the edge of the box before arrowing a right-footed piledriver that crashes off the right-hand post. So close for the Red Devils!
Eriksen whips an aimless free-kick to no team-mate inside the Team_17 area. Ten Hag's visitors have just over 20 minutes to find a goal.
Archer bursts through the middle after McAtee's pass but Amrabat is swiftly on the scene to snuff out any danger. The Team_17 forward looks the Blades' best hope of another goal at Bramall Lane.
Since the start of last season, no side has seen more Premier League goals scored by substitutes (excluding own goals) than Team_14 (15, level with Team_5), with McTominay scoring a brace from the bench last time out against Team_4. Can another replacement find the winner for the Red Devils?
Maguire and Fernandes cannot find an opening down the right-hand side, such is the resilience and organisation of the Team_17 backline. Ten Hag's substitutes are yet to have the desired impact either yet.
GOOOOOOALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!! 2-1 Team_14! The Red Devils have their breakthrough and it comes from an unlikely source. Lindelof works a pass inside from the left flank to Dalot, who curls a right-footed strike into the top-right corner from outside the area. Foderingham got a hand on the effort but failed to keep it out!
Defender to defender creates the Red Devils' second goal, as Lindelof plays a pass inside from the left flank for Dalot to whip a fine finish past Foderingham.
Team_13 loanee McAtee is brought off for Osborn.
Martial aims to find space on the right-hand side but Robinson is soon across to deal with the danger. However, the clearance finds Hamer, who is flagged for offside and Team_14 soon regain possession.
Evans is the first Team_14 player to be shown a yellow card after hacking Archer down on the left wing.
Evans stays down after the foul on Archer, meaning Ten Hag must send on Varane as his replacement.
Hamer also makes way for Traore.
Norwood fails to beat the first man with his left-sided free-kick before Thomas whips another cross in. Traore lurks inside the area before Team_14 turn the ball behind for a corner.
Norwood's corner is cleared at the far post before Garnacho speeds away down the right flank. However, the winger cannot find a pass to Fernandes before the Blades win a free-kick near the touchline for a Lindelof foul.
Souza's tackle accidentally sets Garnacho free before the Team_14 attacker sees a left-footed strike deflected behind for a corner. The Red Devils will be in no rush to take this one.
WIDE! Fernandes works a smart pass inside before Garnacho fires a low right-footed drive towards the bottom-left corner. Foderingham is unsighted but watches gratefully as the effort goes just wide to his right.
Mount comes on for Rashford as the Red Devils look to see out the closing minutes at Bramall Lane.
Trusty makes a perfectly timed sliding challenge to dispossess Martial, who was aiming to burst through the middle of the pitch. Norwood then crosses towards the back post before Fernandes intervenes in front of Thomas.
WHAT A MISS! Martial steals possession from Norwood before rolling through for Garnacho, who somehow slides a right-footed strike wide with just Foderingham to beat. A belated offside flag spares the winger's blushes, but the VAR would surely have checked that decision. There are five minutes of additional time remaining.
A throw-in on the left-hand side allows Lindelof and Eriksen to eat into some more valuable seconds. Team_14 have just over two minutes to close out the victory.
A needless Bogle foul on Garnacho gives the visitors a free-kick on the left flank. The Team_14 supporters laud their nimble winger, who is bizarrely taunted by a Team_17 supporter who made it down to pitchside.
FULL-TIME: Team_17 1-2 Team_14
Team_14 pay tribute to club legend Bobby Charlton, who died on Saturday at the age of 86, with a battling 2-1 victory over Team_17 at Bramall Lane. McTominay's first-half opener was soon cancelled out by McBurnie's penalty, which was conceded by the Scotland international shortly after his goal at the other end. The Red Devils toiled in the second half and went close through Amrabat before Dalot's curling finish snatched all three points on the road. The victory lifts Ten Hag's side up to eighth, while Heckingbottom's men remain bottom of the Premier League and still without a win this season on their top-flight return. The Blades visit high-flying Team_1 next Saturday before Team_14 host rivals Team_13 the day after. The Red Devils are also in Champions League action against Copenhagen in midweek. That is all for now, until next time – goodbye!"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93569	Sheffield Utd	Brighton	2024-02-18	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	29522.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Luton Town and Sheffield United at Kenilworth Road.
Luton played out a thrilling 4-4 draw away at Newcastle United last time out and will be hoping to replicate a similar attacking display against Chris Wilder’s side. The Hatters have scored four goals in each of their last two Premier League fixtures, having beaten Brighton 4-0 in their game before their trip to St James’ Park. Luton are unbeaten in their last four home league matches against the Blades (W1 D3), with their last loss coming in a 6-3 defeat back in December 1994. A win could see Rob Edwards’ men climb to 15th place in the table.
Sheffield United have shipped 59 goals in 23 Premier League games this season. The last top-flight side to concede 60 goals as few as 24 games into a season was Ipswich Town in 1963-64 (24th game), while the record in the Premier League era is Barnsley in 1997-98 (60th goal in 25th game). Wilder’s men will need to see a drastic improvement today after conceding five goals at home to Aston Villa in their previous fixture. With the Blades sitting at the bottom of the Premier League table, 10 points adrift of safety, they will be desperately looking for three points today to build some momentum in their fight to stay in the division.
LUTON TOWN (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Amari'i Bell, Gabriel Osho, Reece Burke; Alfie Doughty, Ross Barkley, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris, Jordan Clark; Elijah Adebayo.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Issa Kabore, Tahith Chong, Teden Mengi, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Jacob Brown, Tim Krul, Andros Townsend.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (5-4-1): Wes Foderingham; Jack Robinson, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Mason Holgate, Rhys Norrington-Davies, Jayden Bogle; Ben Osborn, Gustavo Hamer, Vinicius Souza, James McAtee; Cameron Archer.
SHEFFIELD UNITED SUBS: Max Lowe, Auston Trusty, Rhian Brewster, Oliver Norwood, Tom Davies, Yasser Larouci, William Osula, Andre Brooks, Jordan Amissah.
Edwards has made one change from his team’s 4-4 draw against Newcastle last time out. In defence, Mengi drops out of the starting XI and is named among the substitutes. Burke will come into the side to replace him. The 27-year-old will make his ninth Premier League start of the season.
Meanwhile, Wilder has made four changes from Sheffield United’s previous fixture against Aston Villa. In defence, Robinson comes into the starting XI with Trusty dropping to the bench. In midfield, Brooks and Ben Brereton-Diaz drop out, with Osborn and Hamer given a start. Up top, Archer comes in for Osula.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
The Hatters are continuing to pressure the opposition goal and they now have a corner. Doughty will take it over on the right-hand side and he sends an inswinging delivery towards the front post, but Hamer can head it clear. The Blades now look to counter-attack as it's spread out wide to McAtee, but Lokonga does superbly to intercept and regain possession for Luton.
McAtee gets the game under way for Sheffield United at Kenilworth Road!
Norrington-Davies looks like his game could be over already. He's gone down in need of treatment and he's quickly waved over to the bench. He looks in some discomfort and there is activity among the substitutes. Sheffield United may be forced into an early change at Kenilworth Road.
Wilder makes his first change of the game as Norrington-Davies is unable to continue. Lowe will come on in his place.
Luton will now have an opportunity from a free-kick after Doughty was brought down near the byline. The left-back will take and he delivers towards the back post. Osho rises above his marker and attempts to head towards goal, but he can't direct it goalwards and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Sheffield United.
Holgate goes into the book for a late challenge on Morris as Luton look to attack. He's going to have to tread carefully for the remainder of the game.
Luton will have another chance to fill the box from a free-kick after Lowe upended Ogbene. Barkley is standing over it and he's going to send it into the penalty area. It's whipped into the middle, but Souza is able to head it clear. Luton take a quick throw-in as they keep men forward, but it comes to nothing and Sheffield United force them back towards their own goal.
Morris and Doughty link up well on the left-hand side and the latter gets to the byline before attempting to deliver into the box. He drives it into the danger zone, but Foderingham comes out to collect. The Hatters are getting plenty of joy out wide in the early stages of the game, and Sheffield United need to tighten up at the back.
Lokonga sends a superb crossfield ball to Ogbene who collects on the right-hand side of the attack. He plays it back towards Barkley who twists and turns before spotting the run of Adebayo beyond the Sheffield United defence. He sends a searching throughball towards the Luton striker, but it's a little too heavy and it goes straight into the hands of Foderingham.
Osborn brings Barkley down from behind and Luton are awarded a free-kick, not too far outside of the Sheffield United penalty area. Barkley has his hands on his hips as he readies himself and he floats it to the back post. Adebayo is there to head it back into the middle, but the Blades are able to clear away from danger. It eventually falls to Burke just outside the box, but his shot is deflected behind for a corner.
Luton are looking to get the ball into the penalty area at every opportunity, producing seven crosses since the game got under way. The Hatters have only managed two shots so far, but are yet to test Foderingham between the sticks so far. Edwards' side have dominated the possession, keeping 65.2 per cent of the ball.
Sheffield United look to counter-attack as Bogle drives forward, evading the challenges of multiple Luton players, but Bell is eventually there to prevent any danger. The Blades regain possession and look to sustain pressure, but once again the Hatters get back in numbers to crowd out the opposition and win the ball back. Wilder's side are sitting deep and hoping to hit Luton in transition.
Hamer is the second player to go into the book after bringing down Barkley as Luton looked to counter.
What a chance! Sheffield United fill the box from a throw-in and Holgate launches it in. The ball is headed away but nodded back into the penalty area and Archer finds himself in space just outside the six-yard box. He only has the goalkeeper to beat, but he somehow puts it wide! He will be disappointed not to have hit the target from there!
Assist Max Josef Lowe
GOOOOAAAAALLL!! 1-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED!!! Lowe sends a searching ball behind the Luton defence and Archer is chasing it down. He gets there before Osho, knocks it past him, and drives into the penalty area. He’s one-on-one with Kaminski once again, but this time he makes no mistake, slotting the ball in at the near post! The Blades have the lead!
Almost an instant reply from Luton! Ogbene receives the ball just outside the penalty area and he has Adebayo to his right. He plays it into the path of the striker inside the box, and he attempts a first-time shot across goal, but it whistles past the far post and goes behind for a goal-kick to Sheffield United.
Hold on, the referee is heading to the VAR monitor. He's checking to see if there could be a penalty for the Blades. Souza won a header from a corner, but it appeared to hit the hand of Burke. He's given it! Penalty to Sheffield United!
GOOOOAAAAALLL!! 2-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED! The referee awarded a penalty to the Blades after Burke was adjudged to have handled inside the box. McAtee steps up to take it… and he rolls it into the corner of the net, sending Kaminski the wrong way! Luton have a mountain to climb now after a superb performance from Wilder’s side so far.
Luton might feel that they're slightly unfortunate to be 2-0 down after a few moments of madness, but the Blades have looked a threat on the counter-attack in today's game. Wilder's men have been clinical when it mattered and are now sitting deep as they hope to hold onto their lead before the half-time whistle.
Morris is the latest player to be booked after bringing down Hamer as Sheffield United looked to counter.
Doughty finds Adebayo inside the Sheffield United penalty area, and he gets the ball out of his feet before looking to curl a strike towards the top corner, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Doughty will take and he floats it towards the back post. Osho comes flying in, but he commits a foul and the Blades are awarded a free-kick.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of five minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Luton have yet another corner, their fifth of the game so far. Doughty delivers and Burke wins the initial header, sending it towards goal. Foderingham comes out to collect but he can't quite get there, and the referee blows for a foul on the goalkeeper. Souza is down after colliding with Foderingham, but he's back on his feet shortly after and play resumes with a free-kick to Sheffield United.
HALF-TIME: LUTON TOWN 0-2 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Luton Town go into the break 2-0 down at home to Sheffield United. Edwards' side dominated the possession in the first half, but they couldn't create too many opportunities, with the Blades defending deep. Wilder's men looked to hit the opposition on the counter-attack at every opportunity, and it paid off as Archer raced through on goal before slotting the ball into the back of the net to give the Blades the lead. Shortly after, the referee halted the game and headed straight to the VAR monitor. After a short check, a penalty was given after Burke handled the ball inside the box, and McAtee sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to double his side's lead.
Despite enjoying plenty of the ball, Luton have struggled to create too many chances and have produced 0.37 expected goals (xG). The Hatters have managed to have 70.3 per cent of the possession, but Edwards will be demanding more from his team in the final third. Wilder, of course, will be the happier of the two managers. His team have scored twice from two shots on target, but their tactic of sitting deep and counter-attacking has worked wonders so far. Luton need a little more creativity, so could we see Townsend early in the second half?
Lokonga gets the second half under way for Luton at Kenilworth Road!
Luton have an early corner in the second half after some good work by the Hatters, and Doughty will be delivering into the box. He whips it towards the front post, and Bogle puts it behind for another corner. It's delivered into the area once again, but Sheffield United are able to clear. The Luton players are appealing for a penalty, but the referee is having none of it.
The referee is checking for a penalty to Luton this time! He's headed to the VAR monitor, and it looks as though it could be another handball. He's checked it... and he's given it! Penalty to Luton!
GOOOOAAAAALL!! 2-1! Luton pull one back! Souza was adjudged to have handled the ball, and the referee awarded a penalty. Morris steps up to take it... and he sends the goalkeeper the wrong way, rolling it into the corner. The Luton striker grabs the ball out of the back of the net and rushes to the halfway line. Can the Hatters claw this one back?
Shortly after seeing his team pull a goal back, Edwards makes a change, with Chong coming on in place of Clark for Luton.
Luton now have the momentum with them and are pushing for an equaliser. Chong breaks down the left-hand side and tries to deliver into the box, but his cross is deflected behind for a corner. Doughty sends it towards the back post and Osho rises highest, but his header goes high, wide and behind for a goal-kick to Sheffield United.
Sheffield United make a change as Hamer, who was booked earlier in the game, comes off. Davies will enter the fray.
Sheffield United will now have a chance from a free-kick and it's whipped into the penalty area, but Adebayo can head it clear. It falls to Osborn near the byline who looks to take on Lokonga, but the Luton midfielder brings him down and it's another free-kick for the Blades. Davies delivers, but Adebayo rises highest and heads away once again.
Close to an equaliser! Luton take a quick throw and Morris receives the ball with his back to goal. He turns and drives towards the box before unleashing from range with his left. It's heading towards the bottom corner, but Foderingham gets down low to make a save and tips it behind for a corner to the Hatters. Edwards' men are continuing to push!
Doughty makes a foul on Lowe and the Sheffield United defender is down. The medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment, and he looks in a lot of pain. Wilder might be considering taking him off as he's been down on the turf for a few minutes now.
Edwards makes an attacking change as Luton chase the game. Townsend makes his way onto the pitch, with central defender Burke the player to be substituted.
Doughty should do better! Lokonga feeds the ball out wide to Chong who spots the run of Doughty, who has burst beyond the Sheffield United defence. He plays an inch-perfect throughball into his path and the Luton defender latches onto it. He fires the ball across goal, but he gets underneath it and sends it flying out for a throw-in on the other side of the pitch.
GOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 3-1 SHEFFIELD UNITED!! The Blades hit Luton on the counter-attack and grab a third! Wilder’s side break down the left with Archer, who looked like he had run into trouble. Osho dispossesses the striker, but Davies makes a superb challenge to win it straight back. The ball falls to Osborn, who shifts it out wide to Souza, and the midfielder unleashes a rocket of a shot from the edge of the box which flies into the bottom corner! What a finish!
Osborn pounced on a loose ball just outside the penalty area and quickly laid it into the path of Souza, who did the rest.
As it stands, with Burnley losing away at Liverpool, Sheffield United are now on 13 points, level with the Clarets but behind on goal difference. Luton remain outside of the relegation zone after Everton lost to Manchester City earlier in the day. Wilder's side will need to hold on now though, with Luton pushing to get back into the game!
Adebayo goes close! Luton send a delivery into the box and there's a scramble inside the penalty area. It eventually finds Adebayo who is unmarked from just a few yards out. He goes to strike it, but Foderingham flings himself in front of the ball and makes the stop, and it goes behind for a corner to the Hatters.
Sheffield United have every single player inside their defensive third as they desperately look to hold onto their lead. Luton are pushing, but they can't quite find a breakthrough.

Wilder makes a change in attack, and it's a straight swap through the middle. Brewster comes on in place of Archer.
The Blades look to add some more defensive solidity in midfield, with McAtee making way. Norwood comes on in his place.
Kenilworth Road is growing increasingly frustrated with the Hatters unable to create too many clear-cut opportunities. Doughty is the latest player to attempt to make something happen, but his cross flies behind for a goal-kick to Sheffield United. Foderingham is, understandably, in no rush to take this one.
Luton keep the ball well and are working it around the Sheffield United box. It comes to Barkley from outside of the penalty area and he whips a cross towards Morris, who has peeled off his marker, but he can't quite get his head to it and it goes behind. There is some activity on Edwards' bench and it looks as though there could be some substitutions for the Hatters.

Luton are throwing everything at it in added time, but the Blades are sitting deep inside their own box, with Brewster chasing loose balls in attack. Barkley has it now and he sends it out wide to Townsend. He stands up his marker, shifts it onto his stronger foot, and whips it into the penalty area, but Foderingham rushes off his line and catches the ball.
Foderingham takes his time with a goal-kick as Sheffield United compose themselves for the final few minutes of the game. Luton regain possession but a loose pass finds Brewster just inside his own half. He spots Kaminski off his line and takes aim from inside the centre circle, but he can't direct it towards goal and the Hatters goalkeeper gathers comfortably.
Luton push forward once again and Barkley shifts it out wide to Ogbene. He delivers into the box and it's headed away, but only as far as Chong. He quickly gets it back into the box and it falls to Berry on the edge of the area. He strikes it low with his left, but the sea of bodies in front of the Sheffield United goal get in the way.
FULL-TIME: LUTON TOWN 1-3 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Sheffield United secure the three points with a 3-1 victory away to Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. The Blades opened the scoring in the first half after Archer had broke beyond the opposition defence, before slotting past Kaminski between the sticks. Shortly after, the referee headed to the VAR monitor and swiftly awarded Wilder's side the opportunity to double their lead as he pointed to the spot. McAtee calmly stepped up and rolled the ball into the corner, sending Sheffield United into the break at 2-0. After half-time, Edwards' men dominated proceedings with the Blades sitting deep, and they themselves were awarded the chance to score from the spot after Souza handled inside the penalty area. Morris sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to set up an exciting ending to the match. However, the Blades continued to counter-attack the home side and put the game to bed after Souza drilled a strike into the bottom corner to make it 3-1. Wilder's charges secure an important three points in their fight to stay up, while Luton remain outside the relegation zone in 17th place. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Brighton & Hove Albion won 5-0 at 10-man Sheffield United for their biggest away Premier League win. 
Simon Adingra scored twice on his first appearance since assisting the two goals that won Ivory Coast the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend. 
Sheff Utd played the majority of the match a man down after Mason Holgate was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge on Kaoru Mitoma. 
The result means Brighton leapfrog Newcastle United into seventh place, while Sheff Utd remain bottom of the table, seven points from safety and having conceded 65 goals this season, the most by any team in their first 25 matches of a Premier League campaign.
How the match unfolded
Sheff Utd's Chris Wilder made two changes from the side that won 3-1 at Luton Town, with Yasser Larouci and William Osula coming in for Rhys Norrington-Davies and Cameron Archer. Ben Brereton Diaz missed out due to a hamstring injury.
As for Brighton, head coach Roberto De Zerbi handed recalls to Bart Verbruggen and Adam Webster, along with Adingra. Jason Steele and Pervis Estupinan dropped to the bench, with Adam Lallana not in the matchday squad.
After a decent start, Sheff Utd found themselves a man down after only 13 minutes. After Holgate was initially shown a yellow card by referee Stuart Attwell for a reckless challenge on Mitoma, it was upgraded to a red card following a VAR review.
It was Holgate's third red card since the start of 2021/22, with no player being given more in that period.
Brighton went in front seven minutes later through Facundo Buonanotte, who got the final touch to take the ball over the line from close range after Lewis Dunk had headed Pascal Gross' corner across goal.
Danny Welbeck then doubled Brighton's advantage on 24 minutes, lashing the ball into the roof of the net after Wes Foderingham could only parry Mitoma's shot.
Sheff Utd had the ball in the back of the net before half-time through Ben Osborn, who had tapped in from close range following a corner, but the goal was disallowed. The goal was initially ruled out on-field for a foul on the goalkeeper. Following a VAR review it was decided there was no foul but that Osborn was in an offside position from a touch by Vinicius Souza. After Vinicius Souza’s touch the ball deflected off Buonanotte but the touch by the Brighton midfielder was deemed by the VAR as a deflection (uncontrolled action) and not deliberate play.
Brighton made it 3-0 on 75 minutes, when a cross from Mitoma was diverted into his own net by Jack Robinson. Sheff Utd have netted more own goals than any other side in the Premier League this season, with four.
Adingra then struck twice in eight minutes, his first being from an assist by Pascal Gross, who now has nine assists this season, one behind Ollie Watkins and Kieran Trippier in the race for the Castrol Playmaker award.
The win means Brighton have 38 points, nine behind fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.

Luton played out a thrilling 4-4 draw away at Team_15 last time out and will be hoping to replicate a similar attacking display against Chris Wilder’s side. The Hatters have scored four goals in each of their last two Premier League fixtures, having beaten Team_5 4-0 in their game before their trip to St James’ Park. Luton are unbeaten in their last four home league matches against the Blades (W1 D3), with their last loss coming in a 6-3 defeat back in December 1994. A win could see Rob Edwards’ men climb to 15th place in the table.
Team_17 have shipped 59 goals in 23 Premier League games this season. The last top-flight side to concede 60 goals as few as 24 games into a season was Ipswich Town in 1963-64 (24th game), while the record in the Premier League era is Barnsley in 1997-98 (60th goal in 25th game). Wilder’s men will need to see a drastic improvement today after conceding five goals at home to Team_2 in their previous fixture. With the Blades sitting at the bottom of the Premier League table, 10 points adrift of safety, they will be desperately looking for three points today to build some momentum in their fight to stay in the division.
Team_12 (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Amari'i Bell, Gabriel Osho, Reece Burke; Alfie Doughty, Ross Barkley, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris, Jordan Clark; Elijah Adebayo.
Team_12 SUBS: Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Issa Kabore, Tahith Chong, Teden Mengi, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Jacob Brown, Tim Krul, Andros Townsend.
Team_17 (5-4-1): Wes Foderingham; Jack Robinson, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Mason Holgate, Rhys Norrington-Davies, Jayden Bogle; Ben Osborn, Gustavo Hamer, Vinicius Souza, James McAtee; Cameron Archer.
Team_17 SUBS: Max Lowe, Auston Trusty, Rhian Brewster, Oliver Norwood, Tom Davies, Yasser Larouci, William Osula, Andre Brooks, Jordan Amissah.
Edwards has made one change from his team’s 4-4 draw against Team_15 last time out. In defence, Mengi drops out of the starting XI and is named among the substitutes. Burke will come into the side to replace him. The 27-year-old will make his ninth Premier League start of the season.
Meanwhile, Wilder has made four changes from Team_17’s previous fixture against Team_2. In defence, Robinson comes into the starting XI with Trusty dropping to the bench. In midfield, Brooks and Ben Brereton-Diaz drop out, with Osborn and Hamer given a start. Up top, Archer comes in for Osula.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
The Hatters are continuing to pressure the opposition goal and they now have a corner. Doughty will take it over on the right-hand side and he sends an inswinging delivery towards the front post, but Hamer can head it clear. The Blades now look to counter-attack as it's spread out wide to McAtee, but Lokonga does superbly to intercept and regain possession for Luton.
McAtee gets the game under way for Team_17 at Kenilworth Road!
Norrington-Davies looks like his game could be over already. He's gone down in need of treatment and he's quickly waved over to the bench. He looks in some discomfort and there is activity among the substitutes. Team_17 may be forced into an early change at Kenilworth Road.
Wilder makes his first change of the game as Norrington-Davies is unable to continue. Lowe will come on in his place.
Luton will now have an opportunity from a free-kick after Doughty was brought down near the byline. The left-back will take and he delivers towards the back post. Osho rises above his marker and attempts to head towards goal, but he can't direct it goalwards and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Team_17.
Holgate goes into the book for a late challenge on Morris as Luton look to attack. He's going to have to tread carefully for the remainder of the game.
Luton will have another chance to fill the box from a free-kick after Lowe upended Ogbene. Barkley is standing over it and he's going to send it into the penalty area. It's whipped into the middle, but Souza is able to head it clear. Luton take a quick throw-in as they keep men forward, but it comes to nothing and Team_17 force them back towards their own goal.
Morris and Doughty link up well on the left-hand side and the latter gets to the byline before attempting to deliver into the box. He drives it into the danger zone, but Foderingham comes out to collect. The Hatters are getting plenty of joy out wide in the early stages of the game, and Team_17 need to tighten up at the back.
Lokonga sends a superb crossfield ball to Ogbene who collects on the right-hand side of the attack. He plays it back towards Barkley who twists and turns before spotting the run of Adebayo beyond the Team_17 defence. He sends a searching throughball towards the Luton striker, but it's a little too heavy and it goes straight into the hands of Foderingham.
Osborn brings Barkley down from behind and Luton are awarded a free-kick, not too far outside of the Team_17 penalty area. Barkley has his hands on his hips as he readies himself and he floats it to the back post. Adebayo is there to head it back into the middle, but the Blades are able to clear away from danger. It eventually falls to Burke just outside the box, but his shot is deflected behind for a corner.
Luton are looking to get the ball into the penalty area at every opportunity, producing seven crosses since the game got under way. The Hatters have only managed two shots so far, but are yet to test Foderingham between the sticks so far. Edwards' side have dominated the possession, keeping 65.2 per cent of the ball.
Team_17 look to counter-attack as Bogle drives forward, evading the challenges of multiple Luton players, but Bell is eventually there to prevent any danger. The Blades regain possession and look to sustain pressure, but once again the Hatters get back in numbers to crowd out the opposition and win the ball back. Wilder's side are sitting deep and hoping to hit Luton in transition.
Hamer is the second player to go into the book after bringing down Barkley as Luton looked to counter.
What a chance! Team_17 fill the box from a throw-in and Holgate launches it in. The ball is headed away but nodded back into the penalty area and Archer finds himself in space just outside the six-yard box. He only has the goalkeeper to beat, but he somehow puts it wide! He will be disappointed not to have hit the target from there!
Assist Max Josef Lowe
GOOOOAAAAALLL!! 1-0 Team_17!!! Lowe sends a searching ball behind the Luton defence and Archer is chasing it down. He gets there before Osho, knocks it past him, and drives into the penalty area. He’s one-on-one with Kaminski once again, but this time he makes no mistake, slotting the ball in at the near post! The Blades have the lead!
Almost an instant reply from Luton! Ogbene receives the ball just outside the penalty area and he has Adebayo to his right. He plays it into the path of the striker inside the box, and he attempts a first-time shot across goal, but it whistles past the far post and goes behind for a goal-kick to Team_17.
Hold on, the referee is heading to the VAR monitor. He's checking to see if there could be a penalty for the Blades. Souza won a header from a corner, but it appeared to hit the hand of Burke. He's given it! Penalty to Team_17!
GOOOOAAAAALLL!! 2-0 Team_17! The referee awarded a penalty to the Blades after Burke was adjudged to have handled inside the box. McAtee steps up to take it… and he rolls it into the corner of the net, sending Kaminski the wrong way! Luton have a mountain to climb now after a superb performance from Wilder’s side so far.
Luton might feel that they're slightly unfortunate to be 2-0 down after a few moments of madness, but the Blades have looked a threat on the counter-attack in today's game. Wilder's men have been clinical when it mattered and are now sitting deep as they hope to hold onto their lead before the half-time whistle.
Morris is the latest player to be booked after bringing down Hamer as Team_17 looked to counter.
Doughty finds Adebayo inside the Team_17 penalty area, and he gets the ball out of his feet before looking to curl a strike towards the top corner, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Doughty will take and he floats it towards the back post. Osho comes flying in, but he commits a foul and the Blades are awarded a free-kick.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of five minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Luton have yet another corner, their fifth of the game so far. Doughty delivers and Burke wins the initial header, sending it towards goal. Foderingham comes out to collect but he can't quite get there, and the referee blows for a foul on the goalkeeper. Souza is down after colliding with Foderingham, but he's back on his feet shortly after and play resumes with a free-kick to Team_17.
HALF-TIME: Team_12 0-2 Team_17
Team_12 go into the break 2-0 down at home to Team_17. Edwards' side dominated the possession in the first half, but they couldn't create too many opportunities, with the Blades defending deep. Wilder's men looked to hit the opposition on the counter-attack at every opportunity, and it paid off as Archer raced through on goal before slotting the ball into the back of the net to give the Blades the lead. Shortly after, the referee halted the game and headed straight to the VAR monitor. After a short check, a penalty was given after Burke handled the ball inside the box, and McAtee sent the goalkeeper the wrong way to double his side's lead.
Despite enjoying plenty of the ball, Luton have struggled to create too many chances and have produced 0.37 expected goals (xG). The Hatters have managed to have 70.3 per cent of the possession, but Edwards will be demanding more from his team in the final third. Wilder, of course, will be the happier of the two managers. His team have scored twice from two shots on target, but their tactic of sitting deep and counter-attacking has worked wonders so far. Luton need a little more creativity, so could we see Townsend early in the second half?
Lokonga gets the second half under way for Luton at Kenilworth Road!
Luton have an early corner in the second half after some good work by the Hatters, and Doughty will be delivering into the box. He whips it towards the front post, and Bogle puts it behind for another corner. It's delivered into the area once again, but Team_17 are able to clear. The Luton players are appealing for a penalty, but the referee is having none of it.
The referee is checking for a penalty to Luton this time! He's headed to the VAR monitor, and it looks as though it could be another handball. He's checked it... and he's given it! Penalty to Luton!
GOOOOAAAAALL!! 2-1! Luton pull one back! Souza was adjudged to have handled the ball, and the referee awarded a penalty. Morris steps up to take it... and he sends the goalkeeper the wrong way, rolling it into the corner. The Luton striker grabs the ball out of the back of the net and rushes to the halfway line.

Osborn pounced on a loose ball just outside the penalty area and quickly laid it into the path of Souza, who did the rest.
As it stands, with Team_6 losing away at Team_11, Team_17 are now on 13 points, level with the Clarets but behind on goal difference. Luton remain outside of the relegation zone after Team_9 lost to Team_13 earlier in the day. Wilder's side will need to hold on now though, with Luton pushing to get back into the game!
Adebayo goes close! Luton send a delivery into the box and there's a scramble inside the penalty area. It eventually finds Adebayo who is unmarked from just a few yards out.
