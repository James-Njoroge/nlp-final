93380	Sheffield Utd	Newcastle	2023-09-24	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	30568.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Manchester City and Fulham at the Etihad Stadium!
City are looking to maintain their perfect start to the season and return to the top of the table with another win here today. They've already beaten Burnley, Newcastle United and Sheffield United in the league, as well as adding the Super Cup to their trophy cabinet since the season started. As for Fulham, they started their campaign with a victory, beating Everton 1-0 on the opening day, before losing to Brentford and snatching a late draw at Arsenal last weekend. They come into this game on the back of a penalty shootout win against Tottenham, which saw them through to the EFL Cup third round in midweek.
MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake; Rodri, Mateo Kovacic; Phil Foden, Julian Alvarez, Jeremy Doku; Erling Haaland.
SUBS: Sergio Gomez, Scott Carson, Matheus Nunes, Rico Lewis, Stefan Ortega, Josko Gvardiol, Oscar Bobb, Kalvin Phillips, Bernardo Silva.
FULHAM (4-3-3): Bernd Leno; Kenny Tete, Issa Diop, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson; Tom Cairney, Harrison Reed, Andreas Pereira; Harry Wilson, Raul Jimenez, Bobby De Cordova-Reid.
SUBS: Adama Traore, Timothy Castagne, Calvin Bassey, Willian, Rodrigo Muniz, Carlos Vinicius, Tyrese Francois, Luke Harris, Marek Rodak.
There's no Pep Guardiola on the sidelines after his back surgery, and there are three changes to the City side that eventually got the better of Sheffield United last time out. Doku comes in to make his debut, with Akanji and Foden also being brought in. Gvardiol and Silva both drop to the bench, while Jack Grealish misses out due to a thigh problem. New signing Nunes is on the bench after joining the club on Friday.
Marco Silva is back on the touchline after serving a ban, and he makes four changes from Fulham's EFL Cup game against Spurs in midweek. Leno is back in goal, with Pereira, Wilson and Jimenez also coming in. Rodak, Traore and Muniz start on the bench, as do Bassey and Willian as they return from suspension and injury respectively. Joao Palhinha is not in the squad after his proposed move to Bayern Munich fell through on deadline day.
City have won their last 14 meetings with Fulham in all competitions – among Premier League/Football League clubs in competitive English football history, only the Citizens themselves have had a longer winning run against an opponent (15 against Watford).
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Haaland gets the game under way for City!
City are dominating all of the early possession here as they knock it around in front of Fulham. The visitors are pressing high, but they can't get close to them at the moment.
Walker decides to go for a more direct route this time, sending it long to Alvarez. It bounces off his shin out to Foden, but he is muscled off the ball by De Cordova-Reid, who looks to break.
Haaland drops deep to get on the ball and knocks it on to Kovacic so that he can make a run into the box. It's swept out to Ake so he can swing a cross in, but it's too deep for the Norwegian.
Robinson steps in to cut out a sloppy pass from Akanji, and Fulham have the chance to play out from the back. They neatly work it out to the right side, but Cairney's run is blocked off by Kovacic.
It's a great switch from Reed, and although there's too much on it for Cairney, the touch off his chest helps it to De Cordova-Reid. He curls a delightful cross into the box, and Akanji gets a vital touch to take it away from Jimenez.
After winning back-to-back matches at the Etihad in April 2008 and April 2009, Fulham are winless in their last 12 visits to City in all competitions (drawn two, lost 10). They have lost the last nine in a row by an aggregate score of 27-2.
Cairney has gone down in the middle of the field off the ball and he requires treatment on his knee. The medical team is on, and Silva is readying a substitute in case it is needed.
Cairney shakes his head as he makes his way off the pitch after treatment. He goes straight down the tunnel as Harris replaces him.
It's another sloppy pass from Akanji as he gifts the ball to De Cordova-Reid, and Fulham flood forward. The Jamaican cannot pick out Pereira's run down the right though, and the hosts soon have possession back.
Both teams have struggled to keep hold of the ball in the last few minutes, and Fulham win it back once more. Robinson drives down the left before trying to drill in a cross, but it's blocked by Doku.
Fulham are starting to enjoy themselves here and they're playing it brilliantly through midfield. When it's knocked back to Diop, he lifts it over the top for Wilson, but he gets sandwiched between the two City centre-backs.
City are just upping the pressure now and Rodri chips it over the top for Foden, who has space on the right. He drills it across the six-yard box first time, but nobody is in there for the hosts.
Doku does really well to get the better of Tete down the left and he clips a cross to the far post from the byline. Foden's first touch is a good one, but Robinson steps in to take it off him before he can get a shot away.
What a run from Foden! It's laid off to him by Alvarez down the right and he weaves his way towards goal through a crowded box. Leno thinks he's going to shoot so rushes off his line, but it's squared to Haaland instead, and Diop puts his laces through the clearance.
City have found their rhythm now and they're switching it from left to right and back again with confidence. Fulham are staying compact, though, and making it hard for them to work it through the middle.
ALVAREZ SCORES! It's been coming in the last few minutes, and they've finally opened up Fulham! It's a brilliant throughball from Kovacic into Haaland, and Diop just gets caught wrong side. The Norwegian unselfishly squares it into the middle to pick out Alvarez, who is left with a simple tap-in. 1-0 City!
Haaland has had a fairly quiet game so far, but he times his run perfectly this time to get in behind and sets up his team-mate.
REAM EQUALISES! Fulham weren't behind for long! They quickly work it upfield from the restart and win themselves a corner, which is swung into the box by Pereira. Jimenez peels away at the near post to strike it on the volley, and Ederson gets a hand to it. The ball bounces straight to Ream, who taps it in right on the line. 1-1!
Fulham win a free-kick this time, and Pereira delivers another set-piece into the box. City only half-clear their lines, and when it's put back into the area, Walker scrambles to get it away.
City are struggling to regain their momentum after the Fulham equaliser. They're still looking to use their wide players, but they can't find a way through the visitors' high press.
Reed sends it long once more, and Wilson makes a great run down the right and looks to have gotten the better of Dias. He breezes past him, but the defender recovers well to stop him from getting a sight of goal.
Rodri couldn't get back to stop De Cordova-Reid, and he just pushed the forward off the ball. He's shown the first yellow card of the game.
It's a really poor challenge from Diop as he stretches over the ball and steps on Doku's foot. He also goes into the referee's book.
Foden's free-kick is hit straight into the wall and Tete made the block, but is now down holding his head. He goes through the checks with the medical team, and he'll be able to carry on.
Walker picks out Alvarez in space and he looks to play Foden in behind once more. Robinson reads it well, though, and steps in to cut it out.
Robinson surges forward after intercepting the pass to Foden, but a heavy touch takes it away from him. He crashes into Akanji before he can slow down, taking the defender out, and receives a yellow card for it.
AKE SCORES! City have a goal right before the break! Foden whips a brilliant corner into the box and Ake has a completely free header on the penalty spot. He thumps his header back towards the near post and it bounces into the bottom corner. After a VAR check to see if Akanji, in an offside position, is obstructing Leno, the goal stands. 2-1 City!
It's a wonderful delivery from Foden on the corner and he spots Ake in acres of space in the middle of the box.
Akanji jumps out of the way of Ake's header as it bounces into the ground, and it's not until it clears the defender that Leno dives. It does look like he was blocking the keeper's view, but VAR doesn't see it that way, and the goal will stand.
Fulham are absolutely furious that Ake's goal stands, and they're crowding the referee as the protests continue. Silva is also venting his frustrations from the sidelines, and the referee is giving them a moment to calm down before the game restarts.
HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 2-1 FULHAM
City score just before half-time to take a 2-1 lead into the break over Fulham. The first 30 minutes of the game were tight, with neither side managing to create a single chance. Alvarez actually scored with the first shot of the game on the half-hour mark, tapping in Haaland's low cross. Just two minutes later, Fulham were level once more as Ream latched onto the loose ball after Ederson saved Jimenez's volley. In stoppage time, Ake thumped in a header from a corner, and after a VAR check to see if Akanji was blocking Leno, it controversially stood.
City haven't been at their high-flying best, but despite creating very little in front of goal, they have scored with both of their shots on target. They'll be looking to provide a bigger threat after the break. Fulham need to use half-time to regain their composure after the frustration of that second City goal. They've played well, though, and Silva will feel that they can get something out of this game.
Fulham get us under way for the second half!
Fulham are looking to make a quick start to the second half as it's played long to De Cordova-Reid. He beats Walker for pace before playing a one-two with Jimenez. When it comes back to him, his first-time effort from long range is fired high over the bar.
Walker gets his head down and drives down the right to get on the end of Kovacic's pass over the top. He knocks it down for Haaland, but he can't get it out of his feet before Ream gets across to him.
City are seeing a lot of the ball in the opening exchanges of the second half here, but they're struggling to get it into the box. It's played down the left for Haaland this time, but he's shrugged off it by Tete.
De Cordova-Reid isn't happy about something, and his protests see him get booked for dissent.
City are unbeaten in their last 46 Premier League matches when leading at half-time (won 43, drawn three), dating back to May 2021 against Brighton and Hove Albion, when they lost 3-2.
HAALAND SCORES! City pass it straight through the middle of Fulham as Rodri slides in Alvarez, who touches it towards the edge of the D. Ream sticks out a leg to try and cut it out, but instead helps it into Haaland's path. He's through on goal and makes no mistake as he slots it past Leno into the back of the net. 3-1 City!
Fulham look to make a quick response once more. It's sent long over the top by Ream for Jimenez, and he checks back at the byline to lose Ake and pick out Harris. He wasn't expecting it, and it bounces off him into Ederson's gloves.
The visitors have everyone sitting back in their own half as City continue to pass it around in front of them. De Cordova-Reid eventually decides to press, but they still can't get near the ball.
Wilson cuts out a loose pass by Akanji and knocks it out to Jimenez on the right before bursting into the box. The Welshman is screaming for it to be played back to him, but Ake gets across to stop that from happening.
CHANCE! Rodri threads it through the middle, and this time he picks out Haaland. His first thought is to play Alvarez through on goal, and his first-time shot from a tight angle is blocked by Diop.
City are still dominating possession here, and it's all in their own half as they knock it comfortably around Fulham's high press.
PENALTY TO CITY! It's a wonderful pass over the top to pick out Alvarez, who has acres of space ahead of him. He chests it down before running into the box and gets a nudge in the back from Diop, which sends him tumbling to the ground. The referee points to the spot.
Pereira isn't happy with that penalty being awarded and his protests see him become the second Fulham player booked for dissent in this game.
HAALAND SCORES! It's a brilliant penalty from the Norwegian! He puts last week's penalty miss behind him as he goes for power here today. Leno dives the wrong way, but he wouldn't have gotten near it anywhere as he rifles it into the left side of the net. 4-1 City!
Fulham can't get out of their own half at the moment, and City's high press is making things difficult for them. Jimenez tries to hold it up as he waits for support on the halfway line, but Dias steps in to nick it off him.
There's a double change for Fulham here. Tete is the first to go off, with Castagne coming on in his place to make his debut for the club.
De Cordova-Reid also makes way as Willian replaces him.
GREAT SAVE! Fulham aren't giving up yet, and Pereira bundles his way into the box before being shrugged off it by Dias. It bounces through the Jimenez, who hits the shot first time. It deflects off Ake's legs and Ederson stretches to tip it wide of the post.
City's first change is a double one. Rodri is taken off for Silva.
And Doku's debut comes to an early end as Gomez is brought on for him.
Silva tracks back to stop Wilson's driving run and picks up a yellow card just minutes after coming onto the field.
Haaland has reached 50 goal involvements (41 goals, nine assists) in just 39 appearances in the Premier League, breaking Andrew Cole's record (43 games) to become the fastest player to do so in the competition.
Fulham are making another double change here. Jimenez goes off for Muniz.
Traore also comes on to replace Wilson.
Fulham look tired as they chase City's passes around inside their own half, and they can't get close to the hosts. Foden sweeps it out to Walker on the right and he swings a cross into the box, but Ream beats Haaland to it.
Phillips is being given a rare chance as he comes on in place of Kovacic.
Gomez gets the better of Castagne, and the loose ball rolls to Phillips, who hooks it towards Alvarez at the far post. Leno watches it all the way to pluck it out of the air.
City may not be pushing forward with as much intent, but they're still causing Fulham problems here. Walker tries to push his way past Robinson into the box, but the American stands his ground to stop him.
City's final change is a double one. Alvarez is making way for Lewis.
Bobb also makes his senior debut for the club as he replaces Foden.
City are happy to just keep possession deep in their own half now as they look to see out the rest of stoppage time with their three-goal cushion.
Fulham committed a lot of bodies forward this time and it leaves City with space to counter into. It's threaded forward for Bobb, who is urged to shoot by the home fans, but he dawdles over it and the chance gets away from him.
HAT-TRICK! Haaland scores his third goal of the game! Fulham can't get close to City as they work it down the left and Gomez jinks past Castagne to pull it back from the byline. Haaland is left in space near the penalty spot and he hits the shot first time, drilling it low past Leno into the bottom corner. 5-1 City!
It's a great run by Gomez down the left as he weaves between the Fulham players to create space for himself to pull the ball back to Haaland.
FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER CITY 5-1 FULHAM
Haaland's hat-trick helps City to a 5-1 win to Fulham as their perfect start to the season continues. The game took a little while to get going before Alvarez scored with the first shot of the game on the half-hour mark. Just two minutes later though, Fulham were level as Ream latched onto Ederson's save to tap in from close range. On the stroke of half-time, Ake controversially put City back ahead after VAR deemed Akanji wasn't blocking Leno's view from an offside position. All three second-half goals came courtesy of Haaland, slotting in two well-taken finishes on either side of a penalty, which Alvarez won after being bundled over by Diop.
City make it four wins from four and they go back to the top of the table before the international break. They travel to unbeaten West Ham in two weeks' time. Fulham are now winless in three and will be looking to turn things around against Luton Town next time out.
That's all for today, goodbye!"	Referee: Stuart Attwell. Assistants: Con Hatzidakis, James Mainwaring. Fourth official: Anthony Taylor. VAR: Darren England. Assistant VAR: Neil Davies.

It's threaded forward for Bobb, who is urged to shoot by the home fans, but he dawdles over it and the chance gets away from him.\nHAT-TRICK! Haaland scores his third goal of the game! Team_10 can't get close to City as they work it down the left and Gomez jinks past Castagne to pull it back from the byline. Haaland is left in space near the penalty spot and he hits the shot first time, drilling it low past Leno into the bottom corner. 5-1 City!\nIt's a great run by Gomez down the left as he weaves between the Team_10 players to create space for himself to pull the ball back to Haaland.\nFULL-TIME: Team_13 5-1 Team_10\nHaaland's hat-trick helps City to a 5-1 win to Team_10 as their perfect start to the season continues. The game took a little while to get going before Alvarez scored with the first shot of the game on the half-hour mark. Just two minutes later though, Team_10 were level as Ream latched onto Ederson's save to tap in from close range. On the stroke of half-time, Ake controversially put City back ahead after VAR deemed Akanji wasn't blocking Leno's view from an offside position. All three second-half goals came courtesy of Haaland, slotting in two well-taken finishes on either side of a penalty, which Alvarez won after being bundled over by Diop.\nCity make it four wins from four and they go back to the top of the table before the international break. They travel to unbeaten Team_19 in two weeks' time. Team_10 are now winless in three and will be looking to turn things around against Team_12 next time out.\nThat's all for today, goodbye!""]"	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	Exciting
93386	Newcastle	Burnley	2023-09-30	St. James' Park, Newcastle	52163.0	Thomas Bramall	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Everton and Arsenal at Goodison Park.
The Toffees have just one point to their name after four Premier League games, with a 2-2 draw at Sheffield United last time out their only positive result amid a torrid start. Everton sit in the relegation zone of the embryonic Premier League table after the international break, with Sean Dyche desperately searching for improvements.
Arsenal may have needed the international break to calm down from their last-gasp 3-1 win over Manchester United in their previous league outing. Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus struck late in a controversial, VAR-filled encounter at Emirates Stadium, to record the Gunners’ third win in four top-flight games this term. The only blemish on their record came in a 2-2 home draw with Fulham.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ashley Young, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Braithwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Dwight McNeil, Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana, Arnaut Danjuma; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Beto.
SUBSTITUTES: Joao Virginia, Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Ben Godfrey, Youssef Chermiti, James Garner, Lewis Dobbin, Tyler Onyango.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Fabio Vieira; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBSTITUTES: Aaron Ramsdale, Gabriel Jesus, Emile Smith Rowe, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Reiss Nelson, Kai Havertz.
Dyche makes only two alterations to his starting line-up that managed a point at Sheffield United last time out. Garner and Patterson drop to the bench, with McNeil and Mykolenko preferred for Everton. The introduction of the Ukraine full-back will likely see Young switch sides and start at right-back. Beto, signed from Udinese, makes his home debut for the Toffees, too.
Mikel Arteta opts for just two changes from his last starting XI, although one of them will catch the headlines for the Gunners. Usual first-choice goalkeeper Ramsdale drops to the bench for Raya to make his Arsenal debut, while Vieira comes in for Havertz, who is also named among the substitutes. Nketiah gets the nod to lead the line, despite Jesus returning to fitness and scoring late on in his last game.
Both of Everton's Premier League home games this season have been 1-0 defeats. Only three times in their league history have they lost each of their first three at Goodison Park (1958-59, 2005-06 and 2008-09), while among those only in 2005-06 did they fail to score a single goal. Can Dyche’s side improve? We’re about to find out as kick-off is almost upon us...
Referee Simon Hooper gets this game under way! Nketiah with the first touch.
Everton don't manage to get a foot on the ball for the opening minute as Arsenal probe through midfield. However, Young steps in to intervene inside his own area before the Gunners assume control once more.
An early corner comes on the right-hand side for the visitors as Saka crosses towards the near post, where Tarkowski rises highest to head clear and out for a throw-in.
A deft touch from Nketiah almost releases Odegaard but Pickford races off his line to smash a clearance long up the pitch. If the first five minutes are anything to go by, it could be a long game for the hosts.
Martinelli takes up an unusually deep and central position before failing to find Zinchenko with a simple pass, offering Everton their first real spell of possession. The Toffees show little interest in getting forward, though, as their defenders see most of the ball.
Saka looks to sneak in behind onto an Odegaard throughball but Branthwaite is alert and turns behind for a corner. The Arsenal and England winger whips it towards the far post, where Everton eventually deflect it behind for another set-piece.
OVER! Arsenal work a short-corner routine out to Zinchenko, who finds Vieira in space inside the Everton area. The Gunners playmaker aims to curl a right-footed effort towards goal but gets it all wrong and slices well over the target.
Arsenal have scored more goals from corners than any other Premier League side since the start of last season (15). However, their three set-piece chances have underwhelmed thus far.
Branthwaite sells Pickford short with a poor pass back to the Everton goalkeeper, who is caught late by Nketiah after clearing down the left-hand side. The Arsenal striker escapes without punishment, as do the Toffees despite their centre-back's lapse in concentration.
Branthwaite's long diagonal pass is easily dealt with by Zinchenko before Mykolenko covers well at the other end to deal with the onrushing Saka. This game is yet to truly settle as both sides are sizing one another up.
Saka makes a mockery of Mykolenko before Odegaard is crowded out by a sea of blue Everton shirts. A lunge by Doucoure on Rice offers Arsenal a free-kick in the middle of the pitch, although Nketiah is caught needlessly offside soon after.
White hangs a delicate right-wing cross towards the back post but Vieira miscues a volley and ends up clearing for Everton, who are pinned back inside their own third and struggling to find a way out.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOALLLL! 1-0 ARSENAL! The Gunners deal an early blow to silence Goodison Park. Nketiah touches back for Vieira, who plays a killer throughball for the run of Martinelli down the left-hand side. The Brazil winger makes it into the area before curling a pinpoint right-footed finish into the bottom-right corner. However, the VAR is going to take a look at this one…
NO GOAL! The score remains 0-0. Martinelli's expert finish is ruled out after a VAR review. Nketiah had strayed offside in the initial build-up phase after Gabriel's clearance, proving the latter pass from Vieira to Martinelli as redundant. The first play of the ball appeared to come off Beto, but the VAR and the on-pitch officials have made their minds up!
There's still some confusion on the Arsenal bench surrounding their disallowed goal. Gabriel's pass forward to Nketiah appeared to come off Beto, although the Gunners striker was adjudged to be offside. Mykolenko also seemed to be playing Nketiah onside, but regardless, Everton remain level!
Martinelli, who has just had a goal ruled out, is forced off with injury as Trossard comes on to take his place.
Goodison Park is still subdued as tensions continue to heighten on Merseyside. Dyche's hosts are yet to lay a glove on Arsenal, who have just seen a Rice shot blocked in front of goal by Branthwaite.
Tarkowski is put under needless pressure by Pickford, forcing the centre-back to hook a clearance high into the stands. Murmurs are ongoing on the touchline as Arsenal are still unconvinced by Martinelli's disallowed goal, which by all accounts looked perfectly legitimate to stand.
Beto has the chance to drive at Saliba in an isolated situation but the France centre-back is far too quick and ushers the ball out for a goal-kick. The frustration for Everton continues.
Since the start of last season, Arsenal have kept more away clean sheets than any other side in the Premier League (11). They've also won a joint league-high 13 games on the road, while only Manchester City (17) have conceded fewer goals than the Gunners (18, excluding promoted sides).
Doucoure charges into the Arsenal area and throws himself on the floor under the challenge of Saliba. Referee Hooper shakes his head and shows no interest in awarding a penalty.
SAVE! Everton are growing in confidence in the last few minutes as the Toffees break through the middle. Gueye attempts a low effort from outside the area but Raya gets down well to make a comfortable first save on his Arsenal debut.
Odegaard hovers over a right-wing free-kick before clipping towards the near post. Mykolenko does his defensive duties to head clear as Rice lurks behind him.
Zinchenko and Nketiah are on different wavelengths as the Ukraine captain threads an aimless pass straight to the onrushing Pickford. This has been a first half devoid of good chances thus far.
Vieira stays down after a stray left arm from Beto. Referee Hooper comes over and has a quiet word with the pair before play resumes with a Gunners free-kick.
Mykolenko lunges into Saka with a late tackle but referee Hooper waves play on before deciding to stop the game. It won't be an Arsenal free-kick, though, as Everton restart with a drop-ball inside their own half.
Everton have won four of their last five home league games against Arsenal (D1), including each of the last three in a row after a 1-0 win in this fixture last season. They last won four consecutively against the Gunners between March 1910 and March 1913. The Toffees are yet to get going here, however.
Arteta's side are slowly falling into the trap of awakening the moody Goodison Park crowd. Rice needlessly fells Gueye and the hosts will launch a free-kick long.
Young hoists a long pass into the area but the Arsenal defence stand firm to head clear. However, Everton are soon back on the attack before McNeil sees a hopeful long-range effort cannon into Zinchenko and away from danger.
CHANCE! Odegaard and White exchange a deft one-two to the right of Everton's area before the Arsenal full-back smashes a left-footed attempt straight into the hands of Pickford.
Dyche's side have their backs against the wall as Arsenal manoeuvre possession and look for a gap in the opposition's defence. A wayward Zinchenko pass offers Everton some respite, though.
Zinchenko disguises a clipped over-the-top pass and finds Vieira, whose attempt to pull back towards the edge of the area is thwarted by Gueye. Half-time is approaching at Goodison Park.
Vieira ghosts in behind the Toffees defence but White's long pass doesn't have the required quality to pick out the Portuguese playmaker. There will be four minutes of additional time to end this half.
BLOCK! Gueye wanders down the left flank before crossing towards McNeil, whose left-footed half-volley is blocked with a last-ditch stop by Saliba. The Everton crowd appeal for handball, but referee Hooper is not interested.
Young hacks through the back of Trossard, perhaps taking a bit of the ball with a sliding tackle. Referee Hooper deems the challenge worthy of the first yellow card, though.
Saliba goes down holding his face near the halfway line after a duel with Beto. The France centre-back is suggesting he's been caught by an elbow, although Hooper – who was perfectly positioned – demands the Arsenal defender gets back to his feet.
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 0-0 ARSENAL
A largely uneventful first half comes to an end as Everton and Arsenal are goalless at the break in their Goodison Park clash. The Gunners may feel hard done by to not be leading after Martinelli – who was later forced off with an injury – had a 19th-minute goal ruled out by the VAR. The video officials deemed Nketiah to have strayed offside in the build-up to the winger's finish, despite Gabriel's first pass appearing to come off Beto.
The messages from both sets of managers may be entirely different at the interval. Arteta will fancy Arsenal's chances if his side can move the ball with more purpose in their attempts to break their recent Goodison Park curse. Dyche, seemingly content to pack his backline and sit deep, may want to offer the Everton home supporters some more excitement after an uninspiring first-half performance.
Referee Hooper gets the second half under way as Everton take the kick-off!
Only Manchester City (56) and Tottenham (54) have scored more goals in the second half of Premier League games since the start of last season than Arsenal (52). Meanwhile, Everton have only won one of their last eight top-flight games in which they've been level at half-time (D3 L4), beating Bournemouth 1-0 at Goodison Park on the final day of last season to clinch safety.
SAVE! Arsenal come flying out the blocks in the second half as Saka sees a low cross turned away at the near post. Rice then slips through for Odegaard, whose powerful left-footed strike is parried away by a strong two-handed Pickford stop.
Gabriel is shown Arsenal’s first yellow card of the game for blocking Beto after the Everton striker knocked the ball past him.
Young's free-kick delivery is poor and Everton's tall defenders have little chance to attack it. Onana is penalised soon after for a needless pull on White inside the Gunners area.
Zinchenko takes aim from range but Tarkowski stands strong to block the left-footed effort. A brief VAR check goes on in the background for handball, but it's decided that the centre-back stopped the chance fairly with his body.
It's all one-way traffic as Arsenal push Everton back into their own area. Zinchenko and Trossard both attempt crosses but have little success against the wall of blue shirts.
CLOSE! Saka whips a pinpoint left-footed delivery towards the back post, where Trossard redirects a header back across goal. Nketiah is there and ready for a tap-in but Tarkowski and Young just about manage to clear the danger in front of Pickford's goal.
Zinchenko clips another superb pass in behind the Everton defence before the hosts scramble to deal with Trossard's low cross. A belated offside flag renders the chance irrelevant, however.
Jesus has scored eight goals in just nine Premier League appearances against Everton, more than he has against any other opponent. Indeed, the Brazilian averages a goal every 71 minutes against Everton (eight goals in 568 minutes), the best rate of any player to play 500+ minutes against the Toffees. Surely Arteta will introduce the striker soon?
Chance! Odeegard releases Nketiah through the middle of the pitch but the Arsenal striker takes an extra touch, which allows Tarkowski to recover and block behind for a corner.
Saka's first corner is cleared as far as Zinchenko, whose tame long-range effort is deflected behind once again. The Arsenal winger goes short with another set-piece before Zinchenko has another strike blocked behind for a corner.
Tarkowski's block from Zinchenko's previous shot is briefly checked for handball by the VAR before no further action is taken. Vieira will take the next corner...
Is anyone else allowed to shoot? Another Arsenal corner goes short before Zinchenko sees yet another shot dealt with by the Everton defence. Pickford eventually claims the loose ball, offering the Toffees a breather for the time being.
Arsenal have won 100 of their 204 meetings with Everton in English league football (D43 L61), the most any team has ever beaten another. The Gunners will need to up the tempo in the final 30 minutes to better that record here, though.
Vieira clumsily hauls Gueye to the floor from behind and Everton will have another chance to cross from a deep free-kick. Dyche appears to be readying Calvert-Lewin on the touchline, too.
Young takes an age over the deep free-kick before clipping towards the back post, where Tarkowski has no chance of beating Saliba and Gabriel in the air. The Brazilian centre-back stays down after the aerial duel, much to the annoyance of the Goodison Park faithful.
Arteta makes his first change as the underwhelming Nketiah makes way for Jesus.
Dyche also alters his frontline as Beto's home debut comes to an end for Calvert-Lewin to be introduced.
Only against Brentford in February earlier this year (five) has Zinchenko had more shots in a Premier League game than today against Everton (four), while all four have been from outside the penalty area, his most in a single game in the competition. The left-back will keep trying his luck, too.
A fortunate bounce allows Saka in behind Mykolenko, who recovers to concede another corner on the right-hand side. The England international takes the set-piece short to Odegaard, whose hanging cross gets cleared by Calvert-Lewin.
GOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLLLLL! 1-0 ARSENAL! Back-to-back corners eventually pay dividends for the Gunners. Another short set-piece routine sees Odegaard slide to the right of the area for Saka, who pulls back a pass towards Trossard. The Belgium international guides a first-time left-footed effort past Pickford with the help of the left post. A delightful opening goal for the visitors sends the away supporters into bedlam at Goodison Park.
Saka managed to find a bit of space inside the area after Odegaard's delicate pass before cutting back to Trossard, who finished in emphatic style.
Arsenal have now had a substitute score in each of their last three league games for the first time since December 2021.
A searching long clearance from Pickford seeks out Mykolenko, who wins a left-wing corner after a block by Saliba. Everton will have another chance here.
Raya claims Everton's set-piece delivery with consummate ease before the game is briefly paused as Odegaard goes down holding his face. Play restarts at the Arsenal goalkeeper's feet.
WIDE! Odegaard offloads for White down the right flank before the Arsenal full-back hoists an inviting cross towards the far post. Vieira attempts a first-time left-footed volley that is always going wide as Pickford goes untroubled.
Both of Trossard's Premier League goals for Arsenal have been as a substitute, as many such goals as he scored for Brighton and Hove Albion in the competition. The Belgian has the Gunners on the way to victory in the final 15 minutes here.
Gabriel picks out the run of Jesus in behind the Everton defence but Mykolenko recovers excellently to dispossess the Arsenal striker. Down the other end, Gueye wildly slices a terrible right-footed strike well wide of Raya's goal.
SAVE! A defensive mix-up for Everton allows Trossard to play it through for Odegaard. The Arsenal captain has just Pickford to beat but his right-footed strike is parried away by the England goalkeeper. Vieira's follow-up effort is subsequently deflected behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.
Goodison Park rises as one in a chorus of jeers after Vieira is felled near the left-hand touchline. It looks like Arteta is going to introduce both Tomiyasu and Havertz from the bench.
Zinchenko, who has peppered Everton's goal without reward, is removed for the more defensive option of Tomiyasu at left-back.
As part of Arsenal's double change, Havertz comes on for the impressive Vieira.
Dyche also takes the chance to change things up. Garner is on for Doucoure.
It will be 4-4-2 for the remainder of this game from Everton. With respective numbers nine and 10 on their backs, Calvert-Lewin and Danjuma will be tasked with breaching Arsenal's resolute defence.
Tomiyasu is adjudged to have got too tight to Garner and Everton win a free-kick just inside their own half. Pickford will launch this one high into the Merseyside sky.
Pickford's long free-kick causes a bit of carnage inside the Arsenal box before Trossard is the unlikely defender to hook a clearance down the pitch. The Toffees are running out of time.
Trossard and Havertz combine down the left flank but the Germany international's dinked cross misses his team-mates inside the Everton area. Pickford races to get the ball for a goal-kick, as the Toffees are entering last-chance saloon territory.
Jesus appears to kick out at Tarkowski off the ball. Referee Hooper awards an Everton free-kick, but strangely does not punish the Arsenal striker further.
Dyche rolls the dice for a final time. Patterson replaces Young at right-back.
Chermiti also gets thrown into the mix as McNeil makes way.
Pickford drives another long free-kick into the Arsenal area but Tarkowski is penalised for an aerial challenge on Raya, who dropped the ball in rather unconvincing fashion.
Close! Patterson drives infield and picks out Calvert-Lewin, who pokes a poor attempt towards the far corner. Raya watches it out for a goal-kick as the fourth official indicates there will be just four minutes of additional time. Dyche and Goodison Park are rightly infuriated.
A moment of hesitation from Gabriel almost allows Chermiti to profit but the Brazil centre-back just about manages to recover in the nick of time. Arsenal can ill-afford a lapse in concentration at this late stage.
Jesus goes down holding his head after an aerial tangle with Patterson and Tarkowski. The Goodison Park faithful, as has been the case for most of the game, are up on their feet and sounding their disapproval for referee Hooper, who awards an Arsenal free-kick in the left-hand corner.
Jesus wins a last-minute corner off Tarkowski on the right-hand side, and that will surely be that for Arsenal. Arteta will finally have a victory over his former employers as a manager.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 0-1 ARSENAL
Arsenal end a three-game losing streak at Goodison Park in the Premier League as they eventually get the better of Everton with a 1-0 win. Martinelli saw a goal ruled out after a contentious VAR review in the first half, before limping off with injury prior to the break. It was the Brazilian's replacement Trossard who proved the hero, crashing in a 69th-minute winner to grab the Gunners' fourth win in five league games to start their campaign.
These are the sort of games Arsenal failed to win amid last season's title pursuit, which ultimately unfurled as a rampant Manchester City retained their crown. The Gunners have passed this test to move up to fourth in the table, just two points behind Pep Guardiola's league leaders before European football commences in midweek. Everton, by contrast, remain without a top-flight win this season and must bounce back at Brentford next Saturday.
As Goodison Park empties with frustrated Everton supporters streaming out, the travelling Arsenal faithful serenade their battling heroes. That is all from this live coverage of a hard-fought Premier League clash. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Newcastle United claimed back-to-back victories, easing past Burnley 2-0 at home, with Miguel Almiron and Alexander Isak scoring the goals. 
A slip from Dan Burn almost allowed Burnley to open the scoring after only four minutes, with Nick Pope thwarting Zeki Amdouni’s shot.
Newcastle took the lead on 14 minutes as Kieran Trippier won the ball and fed Almiron, who bent a beautiful shot into the top corner to score in back-to-back matches. 
Alexander Isak had a chance to double the lead, but after the Swede’s initial shot was blocked by Trafford, the striker was unable to finish the rebound.
With 15 minutes remaining, Isak was given another chance, this time from the penalty spot after Ameen Al Dakhil fouled Anthony Gordon in the box. The Swede converted to seal Newcastle’s fourth win of the season to go eighth with 12 points. 
Burnley have only one point and are above bottom-club Sheffield United on goal difference.

Referee Hooper comes over and has a quiet word with the pair before play resumes with a Gunners free-kick.\nMykolenko lunges into Saka with a late tackle but referee Hooper waves play on before deciding to stop the game. It won't be an Team_1 free-kick, though, as Team_9 restart with a drop-ball inside their own half.\nTeam_9 have won four of their last five home league games against Team_1 (D1), including each of the last three in a row after a 1-0 win in this fixture last season. They last won four consecutively against the Gunners between March 1910 and March 1913. The Toffees are yet to get going here, however.\nArteta's side are slowly falling into the trap of awakening the moody Goodison Park crowd. Rice needlessly fells Gueye and the hosts will launch a free-kick long.\nYoung hoists a long pass into the area but the Team_1 defence stand firm to head clear. However, Team_9 are soon back on the attack before McNeil sees a hopeful long-range effort cannon into Zinchenko and away from danger.\nCHANCE! Odegaard and White exchange a deft one-two to the right of Team_9 area before the Team_1 full-back smashes a left-footed attempt straight into the hands of Pickford.\nDyche's side have their backs against the wall as Team_1 manoeuvre possession and look for a gap in the opposition's defence. A wayward Zinchenko pass offers Team_9 some respite, though.\nZinchenko disguises a clipped over-the-top pass and finds Vieira, whose attempt to pull back towards the edge of the area is thwarted by Gueye. Half-time is approaching at Goodison Park.\nVieira ghosts in behind the Toffees defence but White's long pass doesn't have the required quality to pick out the Portuguese playmaker. There will be four minutes of additional time to end this half.\nBLOCK! Gueye wanders down the left flank before crossing towards McNeil, whose left-footed half-volley is blocked with a last-ditch stop by Saliba. The Team_9 crowd appeal for handball, but referee Hooper is not interested.\nYoung hacks through the back of Trossard, perhaps taking a bit of the ball with a sliding tackle. Referee Hooper deems the challenge worthy of the first yellow card, though.\nSaliba goes down holding his face near the halfway line after a duel with Beto. The France centre-back is suggesting he's been caught by an elbow, although Hooper – who was perfectly positioned – demands the Team_1 defender gets back to his feet.\nHALF-TIME: Team_9 0-0 Team_1\nA largely uneventful first half comes to an end as Team_9 and Team_1 are goalless at the break in their Goodison Park clash. The Gunners may feel hard done by to not be leading after Martinelli – who was later forced off with an injury – had a 19th-minute goal ruled out by the VAR. The video officials deemed Nketiah to have strayed offside in the build-up to the winger's finish, despite Gabriel's first pass appearing to come off Beto.\nThe messages from both sets of managers may be entirely different at the interval. Arteta will fancy Team_1 chances if his side can move the ball with more purpose in their attempts to break their recent Goodison Park curse. Dyche, seemingly content to pack his backline and sit deep, may want to offer the Team_9 home supporters some more excitement after an uninspiring first-half performance.\nReferee Hooper gets the second half under way as Team_9 take the kick-off!\nOnly Team_13 (56) and Team_18 (54) have scored more goals in the second half of Premier League games since the start of last season than Team_1 (52). Meanwhile,\xa0Team_9 have only won one of their last eight top-flight games in which they've been level at half-time (D3 L4), beating Team_3 1-0 at Goodison Park on the final day of last season to clinch safety.\nSAVE! Team_1 come flying out the blocks in the second half as Saka sees a low cross turned away at the near post. Rice then slips through for Odegaard, whose powerful left-footed strike is parried away by a strong two-handed Pickford stop.\nGabriel is shown Team_1’s first yellow card of the game for blocking Beto after the Team_9 striker knocked the ball past him.\nYoung's free-kick delivery is poor and Team_9 tall defenders have little chance to attack it. Onana is penalised soon after for a needless pull on White inside the Gunners area.\nZinchenko takes aim from range but Tarkowski stands strong to block the left-footed effort. A brief VAR check goes on in the background for handball, but it's decided that the centre-back stopped the chance fairly with his body.\nIt's all one-way traffic as Team_1 push Team_9 back into their own area. Zinchenko and Trossard both attempt crosses but have little success against the wall of blue shirts.\nCLOSE! Saka whips a pinpoint left-footed delivery towards the back post, where Trossard redirects a header back across goal. Nketiah is there and ready for a tap-in but Tarkowski and Young just about manage to clear the danger in front of Pickford's goal.\nZinchenko clips another superb pass in behind the Team_9 defence before the hosts scramble to deal with Trossard's low cross. A belated offside flag renders the chance irrelevant, however.\nJesus has scored eight goals in just nine Premier League appearances against Team_9, more than he has against any other opponent. Indeed, the Brazilian averages a goal every 71 minutes against Team_9 (eight\xa0goals in 568 minutes), the best rate of any player to play 500+ minutes against the Toffees. Surely Arteta will introduce the striker soon?\nChance! Odeegard releases Nketiah through the middle of the pitch but the Team_1 striker takes an extra touch, which allows Tarkowski to recover and block behind for a corner.\nSaka's first corner is cleared as far as Zinchenko, whose tame long-range effort is deflected behind once again. The Team_1 winger goes short with another set-piece before Zinchenko has another strike blocked behind for a corner.\nTarkowski's block from Zinchenko's previous shot is briefly checked for handball by the VAR before no further action is taken. Vieira will take the next corner...\nIs anyone else allowed to shoot? Another Team_1 corner goes short before Zinchenko sees yet another shot dealt with by the Team_9 defence. Pickford eventually claims the loose ball, offering the Toffees a breather for the time being.\nTeam_1 have won 100 of their 204 meetings with Team_9 in English league football (D43 L61), the most any team has ever beaten another. The Gunners will need to up the tempo in the final 30 minutes to better that record here, though.\nVieira clumsily hauls Gueye to the floor from behind and Team_9 will have another chance to cross from a deep free-kick. Dyche appears to be readying Calvert-Lewin on the touchline, too.\nYoung takes an age over the deep free-kick before clipping towards the back post, where Tarkowski has no chance of beating Saliba and Gabriel in the air. The Brazilian centre-back stays down after the aerial duel, much to the annoyance of the Goodison Park faithful.\nArteta makes his first change as the underwhelming Nketiah makes way for Jesus.\nDyche also alters his frontline as Beto's home debut comes to an end for Calvert-Lewin to be introduced.\nOnly against Team_4 in February earlier this year (five) has Zinchenko had more shots in a Premier League game than today against Team_9 (four), while all four have been from outside the penalty area, his most in a single game in the competition. The left-back will keep trying his luck, too.\nA fortunate bounce allows Saka in behind Mykolenko, who recovers to concede another corner on the right-hand side. The England international takes the set-piece short to Odegaard, whose hanging cross gets cleared by Calvert-Lewin.\nGOOOOOOOOOOOALLLLLLLLLLL! 1-0 Team_1! Back-to-back corners eventually pay dividends for the Gunners. Another short set-piece routine sees Odegaard slide to the right of the area for Saka, who pulls back a pass towards Trossard. The Belgium international guides a first-time left-footed effort past Pickford with the help of the left post. A delightful opening goal for the visitors sends the away supporters into bedlam at Goodison Park.\nSaka managed to find a bit of space inside the area after Odegaard's delicate pass before cutting back to Trossard, who finished in emphatic style.\nTeam_1 have now had a substitute score in each of their last three league games for the first time since December 2021.\nA searching long clearance from Pickford seeks out Mykolenko, who wins a left-wing corner after a block by Saliba. Team_9 will have another chance here.\nRaya claims Team_9 set-piece delivery with consummate ease before the game is briefly paused as Odegaard goes down holding his face. Play restarts at the Team_1 goalkeeper's feet.\nWIDE! Odegaard offloads for White down the right flank before the Team_1 full-back hoists an inviting cross towards the far post. Vieira attempts a first-time left-footed volley that is always going wide as Pickford goes untroubled.\nBoth of Trossard's Premier League goals for Team_1 have been as a substitute, as many such goals as he scored for Team_5 and Hove Albion in the competition. The Belgian has the Gunners on the way to victory in the final 15 minutes here.\nGabriel picks out the run of Jesus in behind the Team_9 defence but Mykolenko recovers excellently to dispossess the Team_1 striker. Down the other end, Gueye wildly slices a terrible right-footed strike well wide of Raya's goal.\nSAVE! A defensive mix-up for Team_9 allows Trossard to play it through for Odegaard. The Team_1 captain has just Pickford to beat but his right-footed strike is parried away by the England goalkeeper. Vieira's follow-up effort is subsequently deflected behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.\nGoodison Park rises as one in a chorus of jeers after Vieira is felled near the left-hand touchline. It looks like Arteta is going to introduce both Tomiyasu and Havertz from the bench.\nZinchenko, who has peppered Team_9 goal without reward, is removed for the more defensive option of Tomiyasu at left-back.\nAs part of Team_1 double change, Havertz comes on for the impressive Vieira.\nDyche also takes the chance to change things up. Garner is on for Doucoure.\nIt will be 4-4-2 for the remainder of this game from Team_9. With respective numbers nine and 10 on their backs, Calvert-Lewin and Danjuma will be tasked with breaching Team_1 resolute defence.\nTomiyasu is adjudged to have got too tight to Garner and Team_9 win a free-kick just inside their own half. Pickford will launch this one high into the Merseyside sky.\nPickford's long free-kick causes a bit of carnage inside the Team_1 box before Trossard is the unlikely defender to hook a clearance down the pitch. The Toffees are running out of time.\nTrossard and Havertz combine down the left flank but the Germany international's dinked cross misses his team-mates inside the Team_9 area. Pickford races to get the ball for a goal-kick, as the Toffees are entering last-chance saloon territory.\nJesus appears to kick out at Tarkowski off the ball. Referee Hooper awards an Team_9 free-kick, but strangely does not punish the Team_1 striker further.\nDyche rolls the dice for a final time. Patterson replaces Young at right-back.\nChermiti also gets thrown into the mix as McNeil makes way.\nPickford drives another long free-kick into the Team_1 area but Tarkowski is penalised for an aerial challenge on Raya, who dropped the ball in rather unconvincing fashion.\nClose! Patterson drives infield and picks out Calvert-Lewin, who pokes a poor attempt towards the far corner. Raya watches it out for a goal-kick as the fourth official indicates there will be just four minutes of additional time. Dyche and Goodison Park are rightly infuriated.\nA moment of hesitation from Gabriel almost allows Chermiti to profit but the Brazil centre-back just about manages to recover in the nick of time. Team_1 can ill-afford a lapse in concentration at this late stage.\nJesus goes down holding his head after an aerial tangle with Patterson and Tarkowski. The Goodison Park faithful, as has been the case for most of the game, are up on their feet and sounding their disapproval for referee Hooper, who awards an Team_1 free-kick in the left-hand corner.\nJesus wins a last-minute corner off Tarkowski on the right-hand side, and that will surely be that for Team_1. Arteta will finally have a victory over his former employers as a manager.\nFULL-TIME: Team_9 0-1 Team_1\nTeam_1 end a three-game losing streak at Goodison Park in the Premier League as they eventually get the better of Team_9 with a 1-0 win. Martinelli saw a goal ruled out after a contentious VAR review in the first half, before limping off with injury prior to the break. It was the Brazilian's replacement Trossard who proved the hero, crashing in a 69th-minute winner to grab the Gunners' fourth win in five league games to start their campaign.\nThese are the sort of games Team_1 failed to win amid last season's title pursuit, which ultimately unfurled as a rampant Team_13 retained their crown. The Gunners have passed this test to move up to fourth in the table, just two points behind Pep Guardiola's league leaders before European football commences in midweek. Team_9, by contrast, remain without a top-flight win this season and must bounce back at Team_4 next Saturday.\nAs Goodison Park empties with frustrated Team_9 supporters streaming out, the travelling Team_1 faithful serenade their battling heroes. That is all from this live coverage of a hard-fought Premier League clash. Until next time, goodbye!""]"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93585	Luton	Aston Villa	2024-03-02	Kenilworth Road, Luton	11594.0	Michael Oliver	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Sheffield United and Brighton at Bramall Lane.
Sheffield United currently sit in 20th place in the Premier League table, but they will be hoping to continue their momentum after picking up an impressive result last time out. The Blades defeated Luton Town 3-1 at Kenilworth Road, ending a seven-match winless streak (D2 L5). Chris Wilder’s side have conceded more goals at home in the division than any other side (31 in 12 games). In Premier League history, only West Brom have shipped more goals in their first 12 home games of the campaign (2020-21). Today, they will face a Brighton side who haven’t beaten the Blades in their last seven league fixtures, with their last victory coming back in 2005.
Brighton will be looking to turn their away form around after a tricky run of games on the road. Roberto De Zerbi’s side are winless in their last six away Premier League matches (D2 L4), their longest winless run away from the Amex Stadium since a seven-game streak under Graham Potter between September and December 2021. The Seagulls lost 2-1 against Tottenham in their previous fixture, conceding a last-minute goal with Brennan Johnson scoring the winner. Playing against the side who currently sit bottom of the Premier League could be a chance to gain some momentum, but the Blades showed plenty of fight last time out.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (5-4-1): Wes Foderingham; Yasser Larouci, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Mason Holgate, Jack Robinson, Jayden Bogle; James McAtee, Vinicius Souza, Gustavo Hamer, Ben Osborn; William Osula.
SHEFFIELD UNITED SUBS: Auston Trust, Rhian Brewster, Oliver McBurnie, Ivo Grbic, Oliver Norwood, Tom Davies, Oliver Arblaster, Andre Brooks, Billy Blacker.
BRIGHTON (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Adam Webster, Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Billy Gilmour, Facundo Buonanotte, Pascal Gross; Kaoru Mitoma, Simon Adingra; Danny Welbeck.
BRIGHTON SUBS: Igor Julio, Jakub Moder, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Evan Ferguson, Pervis Estupinan, Ansu Fati, Joel Veltman, Benicio Baker-Boaitey.
Wilder has made two changes from Sheffield United’s 3-1 victory over Luton in their previous match. In defence, Larouci comes in for the injured Rhys Norrington-Davies and is likely to slot in at left-back. Up front, joint-top goalscorer Cameron Archer misses out, with Osula coming into the starting XI.
Meanwhile, De Zerbi has made three alterations from Brighton’s 2-1 defeat at Tottenham last time out. In goal, Steele drops out of the team and will be replaced by Verbruggen. At the back, Webster is named in the starting XI, with Estupinan dropping to the bench. Adam Lallana fails to make the squad, so Adingra will play from the beginning of the match.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Gilmour gets the game under way for Brighton at Bramall Lane!
Early chance for Sheffield United! McAtee dances through the challenges of multiple Brighton defenders and creates space for himself outside the box. He turns and spots the run of Bogle inside the penalty area, before feeding the ball into his path. Bogle gets it out of his feet and takes aim towards the bottom corner, but Verbruggen gets down well to make the save.
Dunk sends a searching ball over the top looking for the run of Lamptey, but Ahmedhodzic does well to intercept. Brighton now have a throw-in in a dangerous position, but Welbeck handles the ball after play resumes. The Seagulls are dominating the possession in the early stages, as expected.
So close to a Brighton opener! Webster plays a ball into the channel which Adingra latches onto it. He shifts it onto his right and delivers low into the area towards Welbeck. Ahmedhodzic flings himself in front of the cross and it's heading towards goal, but Foderingham palms it away. The ball was inches away from creeping over the line!
Brighton keep the ball across the back line, patiently waiting for an opening. Van Hecke receives it and spots the run of Gross beyond the Sheffield United defence. Gross has burst away unmarked, but he can't quite get it under control and the ball falls to Foderingham between the sticks.
Holgate gets his marching orders! Mitoma twists and turns and drives towards the Sheffield United defence. Holgate steps out and makes a reckless challenge on the Brighton winger at knee height. The referee originally gave a yellow card, but after a quick review from VAR, he's been sent off!
There's a problem for Sheffield United now as goalkeeper Foderingham has gone down. The medical team are on the pitch and giving him treatment at the moment and there will be a short delay as he receives attention. He's now back on his feet, and it looks as though he will be able to continue.
It was always going to be a tricky game for the Blades as they fight to pick up points in their battle to climb out of the relegation zone, but an early red card for Holgate has made things a lot more difficult. Wilder has changed the shape slightly and it's certainly not ideal to have to alter their game plan in the first half.
What a chance! Mitoma and Lamptey link up on the left-hand side before the ball comes back to Dunk. He whips a dangerous cross towards Welbeck who can't quite get there, and Robinson gets an important touch at the back post with Buonanotte flying in. He was unmarked at the back, but the Sheffield United defender has put it behind for a corner.
GOOOOOOAAAAAL!! 1-0 BRIGHTON!! The corner comes into the box and is delivered to the back post. Dunk heads it back across and Buonanotte helps it towards goal. The Sheffield United defence attempts to clear it, but the ball creeps over the line. The referee checks his watch, and he's given it! The Blades will have a mountain to climb now with 10 men.
Dunk unselfishly helped the corner back across goal and Buonanotte was there to nod it home.
GOOOOAAAAALLLL!! 2-0 BRIGHTON! The Seagulls are running riot! Gross and Webster exchange passes before the former delivers towards the back post. Mitoma comes flying in and takes a shot towards goal, but Foderingham palms it out. It falls straight into the path of Welbeck, and the English striker slams the ball home to double Brighton's lead!
Brighton are continuing to push and Sheffield United are struggling to deal with wave after wave of attacks. The ball comes into the box and the Blades can't quite clear it, and it falls to Adingra who sends a volley towards goal, but it flies over the bar and out for a goal-kick. Wilder's side need to settle down and try and remain resolute at the back.
Almost a third from Brighton! Mitoma twists and turns and gets to the byline, leaving Bogle in his shadow. He strikes towards goal but his shot is blocked, before Gross and Welbeck both attempt to find a third as there's a scramble inside the box, but Sheffield United manage to clear the danger.
Wilder has decided to make a change in order to shore up his defence. Osula comes off and Sheffield United bring on a central defender, with Trusty entering the fray.
The Blades are struggling to get out of their own half at the moment, and the substitution from Wilder hints that they could be going for damage limitation in this game. They need to tighten up at the back with Brighton dominating proceedings, or it could get messy for Sheffield United.
Since the game got under way, Brighton have made 160 passes inside the opposition half, touching the ball in Sheffield United's box 17 times. The Seagulls have had 78.4 per cent of the possession and are looking comfortable, helped by Holgate's sending-off earlier in the match.
Sheffield United have looked tighter at the back since the change and are attempting to hit Brighton on the counter-attack. Osborn wins it back and looks to spot the run of McAtee who has burst forward from midfield, but his touch is a little heavy and the ball rolls through to Verbruggen.
Adingra stands up his marker and looks to float a cross towards the back post with Mitoma waiting. It's headed away but Webster chests the ball back into the feet of Adingra, who shifts it onto his right foot and strikes towards goal, but it sails over the bar and behind for a goal-kick.
Another opportunity for Brighton. Lamptey receives the ball on the left-hand side of the box and works it onto his right foot, before delivering into the penalty area. Welbeck rises highest and attempts to head towards goal, but he gets it all wrong and it flies into the stands behind the goal.
Sheffield United have an opportunity from a corner. McAtee bursts down the line and gets in a foot race with Van Hecke, before the Brighton defender puts it behind. It's delivered towards the back post and then headed back across goal, and Osborn puts it into the back of the net! But wait... the referee has blown his whistle, and it won't count! VAR is checking it. The referee is taking a look at the monitor... he sticks with his decision, NO GOAL!
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of seven minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Brighton are looking to keep possession in the final few minutes of the half as they try and prevent Sheffield United getting a goal before half-time. The Seagulls are remaining patient and waiting for an opening, but the Blades are camped inside their own box hoping to remain tight and maintain the current scoreline.
A corner comes into the box from Gross towards Dunk, and the Brighton defender manages to head it toward goal. It's flying towards the top corner, but Foderingham makes a superb stop to tip it over the bar and behind for another corner to the Seagulls. Gross delivers again, but Sheffield United are able to clear.
Lamptey goes into the book for a strong challenge as Sheffield United looked to break.
HALF-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 0-2 BRIGHTON
Brighton go into the break with a 2-0 lead over Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. The Blades started brightly and were applying pressure on the Seagulls, but Holgate made a reckless challenge on Mitoma early in the first half, and after a VAR review, the referee sent the defender off. From that moment on, Wilder's side were up against it. Shortly after, Brighton took the lead as Buonanotte headed home from a few yards out. It didn't take long for De Zerbi's men to grab a second, with Welbeck pouncing inside the box to fire the ball into the back of the net. Sheffield United did have the ball in the back of the net through Osborn, but the goal was disallowed due to offside. The home team have a mountain to climb in the second half.
After his side had conceded twice and were down to 10 men, Wilder opted to bring on a defender for his only striker on the pitch. Brighton created 2.18 expected goals (xG) in the first half, so the Sheffield United boss had to tighten up his defence. The Blades became more resolute and prevented another goal after Trusty was brought on, but the supporters at Bramall Lane might want to see a little more in the final third. Although it's an uphill task to get back into the game, Wilder's men need all the points they can get. Could we see Brewster or McBurnie introduced early in the second half as they push to find the back of the net?
De Zerbi makes a change at the break. In defence, Igor is introduced for Webster.
Lamptey is also substituted for Brighton, and Moder will come on in his place.
McAtee gets the second half under way for Sheffield United at Bramall Lane!
Brighton are keeping the ball well in the early stages of the second half, relaxing in possession and remaining patient. Gilmour now finds Mitoma out wide and the Japanese winger cuts inside onto his right foot, but his shot is blocked and Sheffield United are able to clear.
McAtee finds Larouci on the left-hand side in plenty of space and Sheffield United look to break. He attempts to take on Van Hecke, but Adingra works hard to get back and dispossess the full-back. The Blades need to make the most of these opportunities whenever they win back possession, as Brighton aren't allowing them to have a lot of the ball.
Brighton work the ball well as Van Hecke finds himself in space just outside the penalty area. He fakes to shoot and then fires a pass into the feet of Adingra. The Brighton winger turns and gets away from his marker, before striking towards goal. However, it's a tame effort and Foderingham makes a comfortable stop.
The Blades enjoy a spell of possession inside the Brighton half. They take a quick throw-in and the ball reaches Souza in space outside the box. He gets it out of his feet and attempts an ambitious long-range effort, but he drags it wide of the post and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Brighton.
Buonanotte is the latest player to go into the referee's book for a late challenge in the middle of the pitch.
Sheffield United attempt to hit Brighton on the counter-attack again. A corner comes into the box and Foderingham comes out to collect it. He quickly fires a long ball beyond De Zerbi's defence and McAtee latches onto it. He delays as he waits for support from his team-mates, but the Brighton defence outnumber him and win the ball back.
Mitoma contiunes to cause issues for Sheffield United down the left-hand side. He receives the ball and instantly looks to take on Bogle, drifting past the defender and getting to the byline with ease. He fires a shot towards goal, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Gross delivers into the box, but Bogle can head it clear.
Wilder makes another alteration as Sheffield United look to get back into the game. Larouci makes his way to the bench, and Brooks will enter the fray.
Buonanotte, who opened the scoring for Brighton in today's game, is substituted. Ferguson will come on to replace him.
Another chance for Brighton! The Seagulls have a corner and Gross is standing over it. He delivers towards the six-yard box and Ferguson makes a run away from goal, twisting and getting his head to it. Unfortunately for him, it's straight at Foderingham who makes a comfortable save.
Brighton have continued to dominate the possession in the second half, making 111 passes in the final third while having 86.9 per cent of the possession. Sheffield United are camped inside their own half and attempting to hit the Seagulls in transition. Credit to the Blades' defence, they've looked a lot more compact since the break.
As it stands, Brighton will climb into seventh place in the Premier League table if they secure the three points in today's game. Sheffield United will remain at the bottom of the table, seven points adrift of Luton Town who sit in 17th place, if they fail get back into the match.
GOOOAAAAALLLL!! 3-0 BRIGHTON! Could that be game over? Mitoma receives the ball on the left-hand side and looks to take on Bogle. He works the ball onto his left foot and delivers a dangerous cross into the penalty area. Robinson darts across the front post and attempts to clear it, but he fires it into the back of his own net. Nothing is going right for the Blades in today's game.
Mitoma, who recently came back from injury, is taken off by De Zerbi. Fati is the player to replace him.
GOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 4-0 BRIGHTON!! Dunk finds Gross out wide and the Brighton man looks to whip a delivery into the box. Adingra gets across his marker and volleys the ball towards goal, and it flies into the corner of the net. The Ivory Coast international recently won the African Cup of Nations with his country, and he's back with the Seagulls and scoring goals!
It was a perfect cross from Gross onto the foot of Adingra, who only had to help the ball on its way into the back of the net.
McAtee has found it difficult to get into the game in the second half, and he's been replaced by Brewster in attack.
Sheffield United make another change and this time in midfield, with Davies replacing Hamer.
Norwood will come on for the Blades in the latter stages of the game, with Osborn making his way to the bench.
Brighton make an alteration, with Estupinan entering the fray. Welbeck is replaced for the Seagulls.
Norwood plays in Brooks down the left-hand side and he sends a first-time cross into the box, but Igor is there to clear it away. Sheffield United have a throw-in and Robinson will launch it into the penalty area. Dunk heads it away but straight back to Robinson. He floats in a cross and Ahmedhodzic nods it towards goal, but it goes wide of the post.
GOOOAAAAALLLL!! 5-0 BRIGHTON! The Seagulls are running riot! De Zerbi’s side keep possession just outside the penalty area before Fati attempts a strike towards goal. His shot is blocked but it finds Adingra. The Brighton winger hits it, and it deflects into the far corner of the goal, leaving Foderingham rooted to his spot! Wilder will be hoping to hear the full-time whistle as soon as possible.
All the noise is coming from the away end at Bramall Lane, with a large section of the Sheffield United support heading for the exits. They've seen enough as Wilder's side struggle to get back into the game. The Seagulls have been relentless in front of goal and are showing no mercy!
Gilmour goes into the book for dragging Brooks to the ground as Sheffield United attempted to break away.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of five minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Verbruggen tussles with Davies after Sheffield United win a corner, and the Brighton goalkeeper is given a yellow card.
Davies goes into the book for his involvement in an altercation with Verbruggen.
FULL-TIME: SHEFFIELD UNITED 0-5 BRIGHTON
Brighton secure the three points at Bramall Lane with an emphatic 5-0 victory over struggling Sheffield United. The Blades had a mountain to climb from the early stages of the game after Holgate was sent off for a reckless challenge on Mitoma. Shortly after, Brighton struck twice through Buonanotte and Welbeck and the Seagulls went into the break with a 2-0 lead against 10 men. De Zerbi's side came out in the second half with plenty of attacking intent despite their comfortable position in the game, and an own goal from Robinson made it three for Brighton. The Blades were a lot more compact in the second half, but the Seagulls continued to be relentless in front of goal, and a double from Adingra later in the game secured the victory at Bramall Lane. Up next for Sheffield United is a difficult trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Brighton will host Everton at the Amex Stadium next Saturday. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Aston Villa recovered from a Luton Town fightback to snatch a late winner at Kenilworth Road that consolidated their hold on fourth place. 
Having seen Tottenham Hotspur close to two points off their position with a turnaround victory at home to Crystal Palace earlier in the day, Villa seemed in control as they went 2-0 up through a first-half double from in-form Ollie Watkins. But the home side fought back through goals from Tahith Chong and Carlton Morris. However, two of Unai Emery’s substitutes combined as Moussa Diaby crossed to Lucas Digne to head in the winner in the 89th minute. 
How the match unfolded
Rob Edwards made one change to his Luton side as Andros Townsend replaced Cauley Woodrow, while Emery also made one change as Ezri Konsa came in for Pau Torres.
Villa made a quick start and Jacob Ramsey went close with a chested effort from a Leon Bailey cross, before Luton lost a defender after only six minutes as Amari’i Bell limped off.
Bailey then fed Watkins, whose shot towards the near post was saved by Thomas Kaminski. And from the ensuing 24th-minute corner delivered by Bailey, Watkins had time to head in.
Villa almost instantly got a second through Bailey and Watkins combining again, with the Jamaican releasing his team-mate, who shot across goal and hit the far post.
Watkins continued to torment Luton with his second goal in the 38th minute, latching on to Douglas Luiz’s quick free-kick over the top before whipping the ball clinically into the far Aston right corner. The goal was initially ruled out for offside but a VAR check showed he had timed his run perfectly.
It took Watkins’ tally to 16 Premier League goals, only one behind top scorer Erling Haaland in the race for the Castrol Golden Boot. He also has scored nine away goals, a feat only Dwight Yorke has managed for Villa in a season, in 1997/98.
A heavy home defeat looked on the cards at half-time, but Luton were transformed after the break, getting on top in midfield and testing Villa’s defence with a steady stream of balls into the box.
The hosts got their reward in the 66th minute as Villa failed to clear from a corner and Matty Cash was forced into a goalline block, with Tahith Chong following up to score.
Six minutes later it was 2-2 as Alfie Doughty delivered another splendid set-piece, whipping in a free-kick from the left which Carlton Morris at the far post volleyed low past Emiliano Martinez.
Luton looked the likelier side to score a late winner but in the final two minutes of normal time Diaby delivered a moment of brilliance, whipping in a left-footed cross for left-back Digne to head in powerfully and send the visiting fans in rapture.
Villa maintain their five-point gap over Spurs, with 55 points. Luton remain in 18th spot, four points adrift of safety with a match in hand on Nottingham Forest.

Team_2	"[""Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_17 and Team_5 at Bramall Lane.\nTeam_17 currently sit in 20th place in the Premier League table, but they will be hoping to continue their momentum after picking up an impressive result last time out. The Blades defeated Team_12 3-1 at Kenilworth Road, ending a seven-match winless streak (D2 L5). Chris Wilder’s side have conceded more goals at home in the division than any other side (31 in 12 games). In Premier League history, only West Brom have shipped more goals in their first 12 home games of the campaign (2020-21). Today, they will face a Team_5 side who haven’t beaten the Blades in their last seven league fixtures, with their last victory coming back in 2005.\nTeam_5 will be looking to turn their away form around after a tricky run of games on the road. Roberto De Zerbi’s side are winless in their last six away Premier League matches (D2 L4), their longest winless run away from the Amex Stadium since a seven-game streak under Graham Potter between September and December 2021. The Seagulls lost 2-1 against Team_18 in their previous fixture, conceding a last-minute goal with Brennan Johnson scoring the winner. Playing against the side who currently sit bottom of the Premier League could be a chance to gain some momentum, but the Blades showed plenty of fight last time out.\nTeam_17 (5-4-1): Wes Foderingham; Yasser Larouci,\xa0Anel Ahmedhodzic, Mason Holgate, Jack Robinson, Jayden Bogle; James McAtee, Vinicius Souza, Gustavo Hamer, Ben Osborn; William Osula.\nTeam_17 SUBS: Auston Trust, Rhian Brewster, Oliver McBurnie, Ivo Grbic, Oliver Norwood, Tom Davies, Oliver Arblaster, Andre Brooks, Billy Blacker.\nTeam_5 (3-4-2-1): Bart Verbruggen; Adam Webster, Lewis Dunk, Jan Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Billy Gilmour, Facundo Buonanotte, Pascal Gross; Kaoru Mitoma, Simon Adingra; Danny Welbeck.\nTeam_5 SUBS: Igor Julio, Jakub Moder, Carlos Baleba, Jason Steele, Evan Ferguson, Pervis Estupinan, Ansu Fati, Joel Veltman, Benicio Baker-Boaitey.\nWilder has made two changes from Team_17’s 3-1 victory over Luton in their previous match. In defence, Larouci comes in for the injured Rhys Norrington-Davies and is likely to slot in at left-back. Up front, joint-top goalscorer Cameron Archer misses out, with Osula coming into the starting XI.\nMeanwhile, De Zerbi has made three alterations from Team_5’s 2-1 defeat at Team_18 last time out. In goal, Steele drops out of the team and will be replaced by Verbruggen. At the back, Webster is named in the starting XI, with Estupinan dropping to the bench. Adam Lallana fails to make the squad, so Adingra will play from the beginning of the match.\nThe players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.\nGilmour gets the game under way for Team_5 at Bramall Lane!\nEarly chance for Team_17! McAtee dances through the challenges of multiple Team_5 defenders and creates space for himself outside the box. He turns and spots the run of Bogle inside the penalty area, before feeding the ball into his path. Bogle gets it out of his feet and takes aim towards the bottom corner, but Verbruggen gets down well to make the save.\nDunk sends a searching ball over the top looking for the run of Lamptey, but\xa0Ahmedhodzic does well to intercept. Team_5 now have a throw-in in a dangerous position, but Welbeck handles the ball after play resumes. The Seagulls are dominating the possession in the early stages, as expected.\nSo close to a Team_5 opener! Webster plays a ball into the channel which Adingra latches onto it. He shifts it onto his right and delivers low into the area towards Welbeck.\xa0Ahmedhodzic flings himself in front of the cross and it's heading towards goal, but Foderingham palms it away. The ball was inches away from creeping over the line!\nTeam_5 keep the ball across the back line, patiently waiting for an opening. Van Hecke receives it and spots the run of Gross beyond the Team_17 defence. Gross has burst away unmarked, but he can't quite get it under control and the ball falls to Foderingham between the sticks.\nHolgate gets his marching orders! Mitoma twists and turns and drives towards the Team_17 defence. Holgate steps out and makes a reckless challenge on the Team_5 winger at knee height. The referee originally gave a yellow card, but after a quick review from VAR, he's been sent off!\nThere's a problem for Team_17 now as goalkeeper Foderingham has gone down. The medical team are on the pitch and giving him treatment at the moment and there will be a short delay as he receives attention. He's now back on his feet, and it looks as though he will be able to continue.\nIt was always going to be a tricky game for the Blades as they fight to pick up points in their battle to climb out of the relegation zone, but an early red card for Holgate has made things a lot more difficult. Wilder has changed the shape slightly and it's certainly not ideal to have to alter their game plan in the first half.\nWhat a chance! Mitoma and Lamptey link up on the left-hand side before the ball comes back to Dunk. He whips a dangerous cross towards Welbeck who can't quite get there, and Robinson gets an important touch at the back post with\xa0Buonanotte flying in. He was unmarked at the back, but the Team_17 defender has put it behind for a corner.\nGOOOOOOAAAAAL!! 1-0 Team_5!! The corner comes into the box and is delivered to the back post. Dunk heads it back across and\xa0Buonanotte helps it towards goal. The Team_17 defence attempts to clear it, but the ball creeps over the line. The referee checks his watch, and he's given it! The Blades will have a mountain to climb now with 10 men.\nDunk unselfishly helped the corner back across goal and\xa0Buonanotte was there to nod it home.\nGOOOOAAAAALLLL!! 2-0 Team_5! The Seagulls are running riot! Gross and Webster exchange passes before the former delivers towards the back post. Mitoma comes flying in and takes a shot towards goal, but Foderingham palms it out. It falls straight into the path of Welbeck, and the English striker slams the ball home to double Team_5 lead!\nTeam_5 are continuing to push and Team_17 are struggling to deal with wave after wave of attacks. The ball comes into the box and the Blades can't quite clear it, and it falls to Adingra who sends a volley towards goal, but it flies over the bar and out for a goal-kick. Wilder's side need to settle down and try and remain resolute at the back.\nAlmost a third from Team_5! Mitoma twists and turns and gets to the byline, leaving Bogle in his shadow. He strikes towards goal but his shot is blocked, before Gross and Welbeck both attempt to find a third as there's a scramble inside the box, but Team_17 manage to clear the danger.\nWilder has decided to make a change in order to shore up his defence. Osula comes off and Team_17 bring on a central defender, with Trusty entering the fray.\nThe Blades are struggling to get out of their own half at the moment, and the substitution from Wilder hints that they could be going for damage limitation in this game. They need to tighten up at the back with Team_5 dominating proceedings, or it could get messy for Team_17.\nSince the game got under way, Team_5 have made 160 passes inside the opposition half, touching the ball in Team_17 box 17 times. The Seagulls have had 78.4 per cent of the possession and are looking comfortable, helped by Holgate's sending-off earlier in the match.\nTeam_17 have looked tighter at the back since the change and are attempting to hit Team_5 on the counter-attack. Osborn wins it back and looks to spot the run of McAtee who has burst forward from midfield, but his touch is a little heavy and the ball rolls through to Verbruggen.\nAdingra stands up his marker and looks to float a cross towards the back post with Mitoma waiting. It's headed away but Webster chests the ball back into the feet of Adingra, who shifts it onto his right foot and strikes towards goal, but it sails over the bar and behind for a goal-kick.\nAnother opportunity for Team_5. Lamptey receives the ball on the left-hand side of the box and works it onto his right foot, before delivering into the penalty area. Welbeck rises highest and attempts to head towards goal, but he gets it all wrong and it flies into the stands behind the goal.\nTeam_17 have an opportunity from a corner. McAtee bursts down the line and gets in a foot race with Van Hecke, before the Team_5 defender puts it behind. It's delivered towards the back post and then headed back across goal, and Osborn puts it into the back of the net! But wait... the referee has blown his whistle, and it won't count! VAR is checking it. The referee is taking a look at the monitor... he sticks with his decision, NO GOAL!\nThe fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of seven minutes of added time at the end of the first half.\nTeam_5 are looking to keep possession in the final few minutes of the half as they try and prevent Team_17 getting a goal before half-time. The Seagulls are remaining patient and waiting for an opening, but the Blades are camped inside their own box hoping to remain tight and maintain the current scoreline.\nA corner comes into the box from Gross towards Dunk, and the Team_5 defender manages to head it toward goal. It's flying towards the top corner, but Foderingham makes a superb stop to tip it over the bar and behind for another corner to the Seagulls. Gross delivers again, but Team_17 are able to clear.\nLamptey goes into the book for a strong challenge as Team_17 looked to break.\nHALF-TIME: Team_17 0-2 Team_5\nTeam_5 go into the break with a 2-0 lead over Team_17 at Bramall Lane. The Blades started brightly and were applying pressure on the Seagulls, but Holgate made a reckless challenge on Mitoma early in the first half, and after a VAR review, the referee sent the defender off. From that moment on, Wilder's side were up against it. Shortly after, Team_5 took the lead as\xa0Buonanotte headed home from a few yards out. It didn't take long for De Zerbi's men to grab a second, with Welbeck pouncing inside the box to fire the ball into the back of the net. Team_17 did have the ball in the back of the net through Osborn, but the goal was disallowed due to offside. The home team have a mountain to climb in the second half.\nAfter his side had conceded twice and were down to 10 men, Wilder opted to bring on a defender for his only striker on the pitch. Team_5 created 2.18 expected goals (xG) in the first half, so the Team_17 boss had to tighten up his defence. The Blades became more resolute and prevented another goal after Trusty was brought on, but the supporters at Bramall Lane might want to see a little more in the final third. Although it's an uphill task to get back into the game, Wilder's men need all the points they can get. Could we see Brewster or McBurnie introduced early in the second half as they push to find the back of the net?\nDe Zerbi makes a change at the break. In defence, Igor is introduced for Webster.\nLamptey is also substituted for Team_5, and Moder will come on in his place.\nMcAtee gets the second half under way for Team_17 at Bramall Lane!\nTeam_5 are keeping the ball well in the early stages of the second half, relaxing in possession and remaining patient. Gilmour now finds Mitoma out wide and the Japanese winger cuts inside onto his right foot, but his shot is blocked and Team_17 are able to clear.\nMcAtee finds Larouci on the left-hand side in plenty of space and Team_17 look to break. He attempts to take on Van Hecke, but Adingra works hard to get back and dispossess the full-back. The Blades need to make the most of these opportunities whenever they win back possession, as Team_5 aren't allowing them to have a lot of the ball.\nTeam_5 work the ball well as Van Hecke finds himself in space just outside the penalty area. He fakes to shoot and then fires a pass into the feet of Adingra. The Team_5 winger turns and gets away from his marker, before striking towards goal. However, it's a tame effort and Foderingham makes a comfortable stop.\nThe Blades enjoy a spell of possession inside the Team_5 half. They take a quick throw-in and the ball reaches Souza in space outside the box. He gets it out of his feet and attempts an ambitious long-range effort, but he drags it wide of the post and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Team_5.\nBuonanotte is the latest player to go into the referee's book for a late challenge in the middle of the pitch.\nTeam_17 attempt to hit Team_5 on the counter-attack again. A corner comes into the box and Foderingham comes out to collect it. He quickly fires a long ball beyond De Zerbi's defence and McAtee latches onto it. He delays as he waits for support from his team-mates, but the Team_5 defence outnumber him and win the ball back.\nMitoma contiunes to cause issues for Team_17 down the left-hand side. He receives the ball and instantly looks to take on Bogle, drifting past the defender and getting to the byline with ease. He fires a shot towards goal, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Gross delivers into the box, but Bogle can head it clear.\nWilder makes another alteration as Team_17 look to get back into the game. Larouci makes his way to the bench, and Brooks will enter the fray.\nBuonanotte, who opened the scoring for Team_5 in today's game, is substituted. Ferguson will come on to replace him.\nAnother chance for Team_5! The Seagulls have a corner and Gross is standing over it. He delivers towards the six-yard box and Ferguson makes a run away from goal, twisting and getting his head to it. Unfortunately for him, it's straight at Foderingham who makes a comfortable save.\nTeam_5 have continued to dominate the possession in the second half, making 111 passes in the final third while having 86.9 per cent of the possession. Team_17 are camped inside their own half and attempting to hit the Seagulls in transition. Credit to the Blades' defence, they've looked a lot more compact since the break.\nAs it stands, Team_5 will climb into seventh place in the Premier League table if they secure the three points in today's game. Team_17 will remain at the bottom of the table, seven points adrift of Team_12 who sit in 17th place, if they fail get back into the match.\nGOOOAAAAALLLL!! 3-0 Team_5! Could that be game over? Mitoma receives the ball on the left-hand side and looks to take on Bogle. He works the ball onto his left foot and delivers a dangerous cross into the penalty area. Robinson darts across the front post and attempts to clear it, but he fires it into the back of his own net. Nothing is going right for the Blades in today's game.\nMitoma, who recently came back from injury, is taken off by De Zerbi. Fati is the player to replace him.\nGOOOOAAAAAALLL!! 4-0 Team_5!! Dunk finds Gross out wide and the Team_5 man looks to whip a delivery into the box. Adingra gets across his marker and volleys the ball towards goal, and it flies into the corner of the net. The Ivory Coast international recently won the African Cup of Nations with his country, and he's back with the Seagulls and scoring goals!\nIt was a perfect cross from Gross onto the foot of Adingra, who only had to help the ball on its way into the back of the net.\nMcAtee has found it difficult to get into the game in the second half, and he's been replaced by Brewster in attack.\nTeam_17 make another change and this time in midfield, with Davies replacing Hamer.\nNorwood will come on for the Blades in the latter stages of the game, with Osborn making his way to the bench.\nTeam_5 make an alteration, with Estupinan entering the fray. Welbeck is replaced for the Seagulls.\nNorwood plays in Brooks down the left-hand side and he sends a first-time cross into the box, but Igor is there to clear it away. Team_17 have a throw-in and Robinson will launch it into the penalty area. Dunk heads it away but straight back to Robinson. He floats in a cross and\xa0Ahmedhodzic nods it towards goal, but it goes wide of the post.\nGOOOAAAAALLLL!! 5-0 Team_5! The Seagulls are running riot! De Zerbi’s side keep possession just outside the penalty area before Fati attempts a strike towards goal. His shot is blocked but it finds Adingra. The Team_5 winger hits it, and it deflects into the far corner of the goal, leaving Foderingham rooted to his spot! Wilder will be hoping to hear the full-time whistle as soon as possible.\nAll the noise is coming from the away end at Bramall Lane, with a large section of the Team_17 support heading for the exits. They've seen enough as Wilder's side struggle to get back into the game. The Seagulls have been relentless in front of goal and are showing no mercy!\nGilmour goes into the book for dragging Brooks to the ground as Team_17 attempted to break away.\nThe fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of five minutes of added time at the end of the game.\nVerbruggen tussles with Davies after Team_17 win a corner, and the Team_5 goalkeeper is given a yellow card.\nDavies goes into the book for his involvement in an altercation with Verbruggen.\nFULL-TIME: Team_17 0-5 Team_5\nTeam_5 secure the three points at Bramall Lane with an emphatic 5-0 victory over struggling Team_17. The Blades had a mountain to climb from the early stages of the game after Holgate was sent off for a reckless challenge on Mitoma. Shortly after, Team_5 struck twice through Buonanotte and Welbeck and the Seagulls went into the break with a 2-0 lead against 10 men. De Zerbi's side came out in the second half with plenty of attacking intent despite their comfortable position in the game, and an own goal from Robinson made it three for Team_5. The Blades were a lot more compact in the second half, but the Seagulls continued to be relentless in front of goal, and a double from Adingra later in the game secured the victory at Bramall Lane. Up next for Team_17 is a difficult trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers, while Team_5 will host Team_9 at the Amex Stadium next Saturday. That's all for today, goodbye!""]"	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93393	Burnley	Chelsea	2023-10-07	Turf Moor, Burnley	21654.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Chelsea and Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea need to get back to winning ways in the Premier League after losing to Nottingham Forest and drawing with Bournemouth last time out. Mauricio Pochettino's men have struggled in the final third, continuing their poor record in front of goal from the last campaign. The Blues have only won one of their opening five games and are in dire need to a momentum boost to kickstart their season.
Villa have had an up and down start to the season. Their campaign began with a 5-1 hammering against Newcastle United, but wins against Burnley, Everton and Crystal Palace have highlighted their prowess in front of goal. However, there are defensive deficiencies that were on show against the Magpies, Liverpool and in their Europa Conference League defeat to Legia Warsaw last time out. Unai Emery will be looking for an improvement from his side today.
CHELSEA (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez; Malo Gusto, Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo; Raheem Sterling, Enzo Fernandez, Mykhailo Mudryk; Nicolas Jackson.
CHELSEA SUBS: Marc Cucurella, Chimuanya Ugochukwu, Armando Broja, Cole Palmer, Ben Chilwell, Dorde Petrovic, Ian Maatsen, Deivid Washington, Lucas Bergstrom.
ASTON VILLA (4-2-3-1): Emiliano Martinez; Matty Cash, Ezri Konsa, Pau Torres, Lucas Digne; Boubacar Kamara, Douglas Luiz, John McGinn, Moussa Diaby, Nicolo Zaniolo; Ollie Watkins.
ASTON VILLA SUBS: Youri Tielemans, Calum Chambers, Clement Lenglet, Jhon Duran, Robin Olsen, Leon Bailey, Leander Dendoncker, Jacob Ramsey, Omari Kellyman.
Chelsea have made one change to their side that drew against Bournemouth last time out. Caicedo returns from injury and replaces Ugochukwu in the middle of the park alongside Gallagher. Pochettino keeps faith with the same backline that held the Cherries at bay as Colwill continues at left-back. Chilwell remains on the bench.
Villa have made five changes to their side that was beaten by Legia Warsaw during the week. Watkins is back to lead the line in place of Duran. Diaby returns in place of Bailey in the final third, while Douglas Luiz joins Kamara in the midfield. Torres and Cash are also restored to the back four.
The players are out on the pitch so we should be under way shortly.
We're under way at Stamford Bridge.

Mudryk almost pounces on a mistake from the visitors at the back, but Konsa gets across quickly to prevent him bearing down on goal.
SAVE! Douglas Luiz loses out to Fernandez and it allows Jackson to feed Caicedo. The midfielder has space to fire at goal, but sends a tame effort straight at Martinez.
Sterling plays the give and go with Jackson down the right flank, but Torres gets across to force a corner.
Disasi tries to connect with Fernandez's corner from the right flank, but it skims his head. It strikes Kamara on the arm, but the Chelsea appeals for a penalty are muted.
Chelsea are probing with menace down the right flank in the early stages through Sterling and Gusto, who are finding space in the wide areas.
Thiago Silva angles a ball over the top for Mudryk down the left flank. He steers a cutback towards Jackson, but Konsa on the slide directs it away from danger.
Colwill makes a break down the left flank and he sends a low cross into the middle. Kamara slides and he knocks the ball off Jackson's arm to earn Villa a free-kick.
Jackson makes a surge into the Chelsea half and skips past one challenge, but Kamara acts to win the ball back for the visitors using his frame to edge out the forward.
Digne gets forward and combines with Zaniolo, who wins a corner off the body of Gallagher.
WHAT A SAVE! Douglas Luiz whips a corner towards the near post that is deflected out to Digne. He powers a strike towards goal on his left foot that Sanchez has to turn over the bar.
Jackson speeds into the box and has Sterling in support. He goes down under pressure from Konsa, but the flag is up for offside anyway.
Fernandez is down after taking a knock in a challenge with Zaniolo. He walks gingerly to his feet, which will something to monitor for Pochettino.
CHANCE! Mudryk threads the needle to release Jackson in the inside-left channel. The forward goes for a first-time strike on his left foot, poking his effort towards goal, but Martinez diverts it behind. Jackson had more time than he thought there.
Jackson has space in the final third, but he takes the path away from goal and his eventual cross towards Fernandez is nodded back to Martinez by Cash.
Chelsea are getting the ball in the right areas, but their decision-making with their final pass and shot has been their downfall today.
Cash is afforded space on the right flank and he takes on the early strike at goal that is deflected into the arms of Sanchez by Colwill.
The visitors have struggled to get control of possession, but have been alert in the final third. With Villa's quality, the hosts cannot afford to lose the ball in their own half.
CHANCE! Gusto bursts down the right flank and cuts the ball back to Fernandez. He has space and time, but scuffs his strike well wide of the target. Fernandez had to hit the target there.
Watkins wins possession for the visitors following a loose pass from Colwill. Caicedo brings down the forward on the charge 25 yards from goal, handing Villa a free-kick in a useful position.
Douglas Luiz lines up a strike at goal, but his effort clips the Chelsea wall and drifts wide for a corner.
SAVE! Sanchez rescues Chelsea again. Kamara rises to head a corner from Douglas Luiz back into a dangerous area. Zaniolo shoots on the turn on the volley, but sees his effort turned over the bar.
Digne latches onto another loose ball on the edge of the Chelsea box following a corner. On this occasion, he lifts his effort comfortably over the top.
Mudryk surges past Cash down the left flank and places a perfect low ball across the face of goal, but both Jackson and Sterling are nowhere to be seen.
Jackson sends Gusto away down the right flank, but he is forced to wait for support and his cutback towards Gallagher is cleared behind.
DISALLOWED GOAL! Disasi heads Gusto's cross into the back of the net with a fine effort, but the offside flag cuts short his celebration.
Digne drags back Sterling on a run off the ball and goes into the book.
There will be three minutes of added time.
HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 0-0 ASTON VILLA
Despite signalling three minutes of added time, the half ends after only two. It's goalless at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League clash between Chelsea and Aston Villa. Villa have had the best chances of the game as Robert Sanchez has been called on twice to deny Lucas Digne and Nicolo Zaniolo with reaction stops. At the other end, Chelsea have had the ball in the next, but Axel Disasi was offside, while Nicolas Jackson also missed a good opportunity.
It has been groundhog day for Chelsea in front of goal. They've got themselves into good positions, but have lacked the clinical edge to get the breakthrough. Disasi should have kept himself onside, while Jackson should have converted his opening. Villa have looked dangerous at times, but have been exposed at the back as well.
We're back under way at Stamford Bridge.
SAVE! Thiago Silva releases Sterling over the top and through on goal. He only has Martinez to beat as he bears down on the target, but the Villa keeper spreads himself to make the stop.
Fernandez curls a fine cross to the back post for Jackson to attack. He connects with a header, but sends it just wide of the target. The flag goes up for offside anyway.
Jackson is booked for encroachment.
OFFSIDE! Chelsea are in behind the high Aston Villa line again. Sterling bursts through on goal, but sees his effort blocked. Once again, the flag goes up late. Sterling and Jackson need to start timing these runs.
Martinez takes a loose touch before his clearance downfield and it results in Jackson blocking the ball, but it bounces back for a goal-kick.
Gusto could be in trouble here as he catches Digne on the ankle with his boot. The referee is being told to look at the screen at the side of the field.
OFF! Gusto is sent off. Having initially been given a yellow card, Gusto's punishment is upgraded to a red for catching Digne on the ankle with an outstretched boot after a VAR check. Chelsea are down to 10 men.
SCRAMBLE! Cash and Douglas Luiz force efforts at goal around the Chelsea box, but the wall of blue shirts hold firm in front of the net to concede only a corner.
Mudryk makes way for Chilwell to shore up the Chelsea defence following Gusto's dismissal.
Zaniolo collects in the final third and has space to shoot, but he sees his effort charged down by Thiago Silva.
Cash goes for a blast from distance, but Sanchez watches it carefully into his hands. Villa are upping the ante now.
Caicedo sends an early ball over the top for Jackson, but he takes a poor first touch and allows Konsa to recover to edge him out in the Villa box.

GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!! WATKINS SCORES ON THE BREAK!!!!! 1-0 VILLA! Chelsea pay the price for committing too many men forward as Watkins produces a clinical finish. Gallagher's cutback evades every blue shirt in the box and Villa work the ball forward. Diaby feeds Watkins, who faces off against Colwill on his run into the box. Colwill blocks his first shot, but he buries the second with a finish off the inside of the left post.

SAVE! Chilwell is played into space and only has Martinez to beat, but he fires his left-footed strike straight at Martinez.

Tielemans enters the action for Villa in their midfield for Diaby.
SAVE! Sanchez keeps Chelsea in the game as he turns a curling strike from Ramsey past the post that was seemingly destined for the bottom-right corner.
Konsa attacks the resulting corner from Bailey, only to plant his header over the top.
Chelsea win a free-kick on the left flank that Chilwell delivers deep to the back post that Broja fails to connect with on the slide.

FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 0-1 ASTON VILLA
Aston Villa inflict further pain on Chelsea with a 1-0 win in their Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge. After a goalless first period, Malo Gusto was sent off after a VAR checked overturned his yellow card and awarded a red card for a challenge on Lucas Digne in the second half. Villa upped the ante with their numerical advantage and took the lead through a counter as Ollie Watkins buried his chance on the break. The Blues' problems in goal persisted as they failed to find the back of the net for the third game on the bounce and have now only taken one point out of a possible nine from their last three matches. Villa move up to sixth with their victory.
Chelsea are next in action in the EFL Cup against Brighton next week at home. Villa take on Everton in their EFL Cup game on Wednesday at Villa Park.
Thanks for joining our commentary today. Until next time, goodbye."	"Chelsea equalled their biggest win of the season as they came from behind to beat Burnley 4-1 at Turf Moor.
The home side made an excellent start, going ahead in the 15th minute through Wilson Odobert, who at the age of 18 years and 313 days became their youngest-ever goalscorer.
Lyle Foster played a big part in the goal after running at the Chelsea defence before passing left to Odobert. The French winger took a touch before shooting through Marc Cucurella’s legs and into the far corner.
Chelsea fought back and drew level just before half-time through an own goal from Ameen Al Dakhil. The Burnley centre-back diverted the ball over his goalkeeper and into his own net after Raheem Sterling’s cross from the left.
Chelsea completed the turnaround early in the second half through Cole Palmer’s first Premier League goal. He converted a penalty after Sterling was fouled by Vitinho.  
Sterling then capped off an excellent performance with his third Premier League goal of the season when he found the left corner after being set up by Conor Gallagher.
The Blues then capped off a fantastic display when substitute Nicolas Jackson made it 4-1, showing great composure to spin on the ball before firing it in the bottom corner.
Chelsea go 10th with 11 points, while Burnley remain 18th with four.

Team_6	Team_7	"[""Hello and welcome to the live commentary of the Premier League clash between Team_7 and Team_2 at Stamford Bridge.\nTeam_7 need to get back to winning ways in the Premier League after losing to Team_16 and drawing with Team_3 last time out. Mauricio Pochettino's men have struggled in the final third, continuing their poor record in front of goal from the last campaign. The Blues have only won one of their opening five games and are in dire need to a momentum boost to kickstart their season.\nVilla have had an up and down start to the season. Their campaign began with a 5-1 hammering against Team_15, but wins against Team_6, Team_9 and Team_8 have highlighted their prowess in front of goal. However, there are defensive deficiencies that were on show against the Magpies, Team_11 and in their Europa Conference League defeat to Legia Warsaw last time out. Unai Emery will be looking for an improvement from his side today.\nTeam_7 (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez;\xa0Malo Gusto,\xa0Axel Disasi, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Conor Gallagher, Moises Caicedo; Raheem Sterling, Enzo Fernandez,\xa0Mykhailo Mudryk; Nicolas Jackson.\nTeam_7 SUBS: Marc Cucurella,\xa0Chimuanya Ugochukwu, Armando Broja, Cole Palmer,\xa0Ben Chilwell,\xa0Dorde Petrovic, Ian Maatsen,\xa0Deivid Washington,\xa0Lucas Bergstrom.\nTeam_2 (4-2-3-1): Emiliano Martinez; Matty Cash,\xa0Ezri Konsa,\xa0Pau Torres,\xa0Lucas Digne;\xa0Boubacar Kamara,\xa0Douglas Luiz, John McGinn,\xa0Moussa Diaby,\xa0Nicolo Zaniolo; Ollie Watkins.\nTeam_2 SUBS:\xa0Youri Tielemans, Calum Chambers,\xa0Clement Lenglet,\xa0Jhon Duran,\xa0Robin Olsen,\xa0Leon Bailey,\xa0Leander Dendoncker, Jacob Ramsey, Omari Kellyman.\nTeam_7 have made one change to their side that drew against Team_3 last time out. Caicedo returns from injury and replaces Ugochukwu in the middle of the park alongside Gallagher. Pochettino keeps faith with the same backline that held the Cherries at bay as Colwill continues at left-back. Chilwell remains on the bench.\nVilla have made five changes to their side that was beaten by Legia Warsaw during the week. Watkins is back to lead the line in place of Duran. Diaby returns in place of Bailey in the final third, while Douglas Luiz joins Kamara in the midfield. Torres and Cash are also restored to the back four.\nThe players are out on the pitch so we should be under way shortly.\nWe're under way at Stamford Bridge.\nMudryk releases the run of Fernandez over the top, but his cross back into the middle evades Jackson and the flag goes up late for offside anyway.\nMudryk almost pounces on a mistake from the visitors at the back, but Konsa gets across quickly to prevent him bearing down on goal.\nSAVE! Douglas Luiz loses out to Fernandez and it allows Jackson to feed Caicedo. The midfielder has space to fire at goal, but sends a tame effort straight at Martinez.\nSterling plays the give and go with Jackson down the right flank, but Torres gets across to force a corner.\nDisasi tries to connect with Fernandez's corner from the right flank, but it skims his head. It strikes Kamara on the arm, but the Team_7 appeals for a penalty are muted.\nTeam_7 are probing with menace down the right flank in the early stages through Sterling and Gusto, who are finding space in the wide areas.\nThiago Silva angles a ball over the top for Mudryk down the left flank. He steers a cutback towards Jackson, but Konsa on the slide directs it away from danger.\nColwill makes a break down the left flank and he sends a low cross into the middle. Kamara slides and he knocks the ball off Jackson's arm to earn Villa a free-kick.\nJackson makes a surge into the Team_7 half and skips past one challenge, but Kamara acts to win the ball back for the visitors using his frame to edge out the forward.\nDigne gets forward and combines with Zaniolo, who wins a corner off the body of Gallagher.\nWHAT A SAVE! Douglas Luiz whips a corner towards the near post that is deflected out to Digne. He powers a strike towards goal on his left foot that Sanchez has to turn over the bar.\nJackson speeds into the box and has Sterling in support. He goes down under pressure from Konsa, but the flag is up for offside anyway.\nFernandez is down after taking a knock in a challenge with Zaniolo. He walks gingerly to his feet, which will something to monitor for Pochettino.\nCHANCE! Mudryk threads the needle to release Jackson in the inside-left channel. The forward goes for a first-time strike on his left foot, poking his effort towards goal, but Martinez diverts it behind. Jackson had more time than he thought there.\nJackson has space in the final third, but he takes the path away from goal and his eventual cross towards Fernandez is nodded back to Martinez by Cash.\nTeam_7 are getting the ball in the right areas, but their decision-making with their final pass and shot has been their downfall today.\nCash is afforded space on the right flank and he takes on the early strike at goal that is deflected into the arms of Sanchez by Colwill.\nThe visitors have struggled to get control of possession, but have been alert in the final third. With Villa's quality, the hosts cannot afford to lose the ball in their own half.\nCHANCE! Gusto bursts down the right flank and cuts the ball back to Fernandez. He has space and time, but scuffs his strike well wide of the target. Fernandez had to hit the target there.\nWatkins wins possession for the visitors following a loose pass from Colwill. Caicedo brings down the forward on the charge 25 yards from goal, handing Villa a free-kick in a useful position.\nDouglas Luiz lines up a strike at goal, but his effort clips the Team_7 wall and drifts wide for a corner.\nSAVE! Sanchez rescues Team_7 again. Kamara rises to head a corner from Douglas Luiz back into a dangerous area. Zaniolo shoots on the turn on the volley, but sees his effort turned over the bar.\nDigne latches onto another loose ball on the edge of the Team_7 box following a corner. On this occasion, he lifts his effort comfortably over the top.\nMudryk surges past Cash down the left flank and places a perfect low ball across the face of goal, but both Jackson and Sterling are nowhere to be seen.\nJackson sends Gusto away down the right flank, but he is forced to wait for support and his cutback towards Gallagher is cleared behind.\nDISALLOWED GOAL! Disasi heads Gusto's cross into the back of the net with a fine effort, but the offside flag cuts short his celebration.\nDigne drags back Sterling on a run off the ball and goes into the book.\nThere will be three minutes of added time.\nHALF-TIME: Team_7 0-0 Team_2\nDespite signalling three minutes of added time, the half ends after only two. It's goalless at Stamford Bridge in the Premier League clash between Team_7 and Team_2. Villa have had the best chances of the game as Robert Sanchez has been called on twice to deny Lucas Digne and Nicolo Zaniolo with reaction stops. At the other end, Team_7 have had the ball in the next, but Axel Disasi was offside, while Nicolas Jackson also missed a good opportunity.\nIt has been groundhog day for Team_7 in front of goal. They've got themselves into good positions, but have lacked the clinical edge to get the breakthrough. Disasi should have kept himself onside, while Jackson should have converted his opening. Villa have looked dangerous at times, but have been exposed at the back as well.\nWe're back under way at Stamford Bridge.\nSAVE! Thiago Silva releases Sterling over the top and through on goal. He only has Martinez to beat as he bears down on the target, but the Villa keeper spreads himself to make the stop.\nFernandez curls a fine cross to the back post for Jackson to attack. He connects with a header, but sends it just wide of the target. The flag goes up for offside anyway.\nJackson is booked for encroachment.\nOFFSIDE! Team_7 are in behind the high Team_2 line again. Sterling bursts through on goal, but sees his effort blocked. Once again, the flag goes up late. Sterling and Jackson need to start timing these runs.\nMartinez takes a loose touch before his clearance downfield and it results in Jackson blocking the ball, but it bounces back for a goal-kick.\nGusto could be in trouble here as he catches Digne on the ankle with his boot.\xa0The referee is being told to look at the screen at the side of the field.\nOFF! Gusto is sent off. Having initially been given a yellow card, Gusto's punishment is upgraded to a red for catching Digne on the ankle with an outstretched boot after a VAR check. Team_7 are down to 10 men.\nSCRAMBLE! Cash and Douglas Luiz force efforts at goal around the Team_7 box, but the wall of blue shirts hold firm in front of the net to concede only a corner.\nMudryk makes way for Chilwell to shore up the Team_7 defence following Gusto's dismissal.\nZaniolo collects in the final third and has space to shoot, but he sees his effort charged down by Thiago Silva.\nCash goes for a blast from distance, but Sanchez watches it carefully into his hands. Villa are upping the ante now.\nCaicedo sends an early ball over the top for Jackson, but he takes a poor first touch and allows Konsa to recover to edge him out in the Villa box.\nGusto, aged 20 years and 128 days, is the third-youngest Team_7 player to receive a Premier League red card.\nUgochukwu enters the action to replace Jackson to shore up the Team_7 midfield.\nPalmer is on for Fernandez in the final third.\nDIABY HAS TO HIT THE TARGET! The winger collects the ball following a loose header at the back post. He shoots first time, but scuffs his effort into the ground and wide of the target.\nGOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!! WATKINS SCORES ON THE BREAK!!!!! 1-0 VILLA! Team_7 pay the price for committing too many men forward as Watkins produces a clinical finish. Gallagher's cutback evades every blue shirt in the box and Villa work the ball forward. Diaby feeds Watkins, who faces off against Colwill on his run into the box. Colwill blocks his first shot, but he buries the second with a finish off the inside of the left post.\nRamsey enters the action to replace McGinn in the Villa midfield.\nBailey replaces Zaniolo in the final third.\nSAVE! Chilwell is played into space and only has Martinez to beat, but he fires his left-footed strike straight at Martinez.\nPalmer times his throughball to perfection to release Disasi down the right flank.

93643	Brentford	Sheffield Utd	2024-04-13	Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford	17115.0	Samuel Barrott	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Crystal Palace and Manchester City at Selhurst Park.
Palace started well under new manager Oliver Glasner and beat Burnley 3-0 in his first match in charge, but the Eagles have since failed to win their last four games in the top flight (drawing two and losing two). Their 1-0 loss to Bournemouth in their previous outing was particularly frustrating, with Eberechi Eze's potential opener disallowed for offside after a VAR check before Justin Kluivert struck the winner for the Cherries in the 79th minute. However, it would be a stretch to say Palace deserved anything out of the match at the Vitality Stadium after only creating an xG (expected goals) of 0.19 from their three shots. The Eagles are in 14th position in the Premier League and are eight points above the relegation zone with eight games remaining, meaning there is not much to play for, but Glasner will use the final part of the season to see who is in his plans for the next campaign.
City returned to winning ways in their previous match, beating Champions League hopefuls Aston Villa 4-1 after back-to-back draws with title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal. Jhon Duran cancelled out Rodri's opener to level the score before Phil Foden netted a stunning hat-trick to extend City's unbeaten run in the top flight to 15 games and keep them within three points of table-toppers Liverpool. Pep Guardiola's men will temporarily go above second-place Arsenal with a win. However, they will only move to the summit if they beat Palace by four goals or more. City will be confident of securing a positive result after winning six and drawing two of their last eight Premier League away matches against Palace, and will want to keep spirits high heading into their huge Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie against Real Madrid in Spain next week.
CRYSTAL PALACE (3-4-3): Dean Henderson; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Jefferson Lerma; Daniel Munnoz, Adam Wharton, Will Hughes, Tyrick Mitchell; Eberechi Eze, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: James Tomkins, Michael Olise, Jeffrey Schlupp, Nathaniel Clyne, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Remi Matthews, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh-Chibueze.
MANCHESTER CITY (4-1-4-1): Stefan Ortega; Rico Lewis, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri; Oscar Bobb, Kevin De Bruyne, Julian Alvarez, Jack Grealish; Erling Haaland.
MANCHESTER CITY SUBS: Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Gomez, Manuel Akanji, Matheus Nunes, Ederson, Phil Foden, Mahamadou Susoho.
Palace name the same side that started their 1-0 loss to Bournemouth in their previous Premier League outing. However, Olise returns to the bench after missing the last seven matches through injury.
City make four alterations to the team that beat Villa 4-1 in their previous match. Despite scoring a hat-trick against the Lions, Foden drops onto the bench and is replaced by De Bruyne, who captains the side. Stones comes in for Akanji at centre-back, and Bobb is picked ahead of Doku on the right. Haaland appears up front and is in the side instead of Silva, meaning Alvarez drops further back. Ederson returns to the squad after getting injured against Liverpool last month, allowing Ortega to start again.
Palace came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with City in the reverse fixture in December. Only in 1992-93, 1994-95, and 2021-22 have they avoided defeat in both Premier League meetings with the Citizens in a season. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.
Palace get this Premier League clash under way. The two teams switched sides before the start.
It will be interesting to see if Palace have a strong start, with the Eagles playing at home with an unchanged side and an extra day of rest compared to City. The visitors might look to build their way into the contest after making four switches. However, it is tough to disagree with Guardiola, who has led his side to a 25-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Haaland is back, but if the Citizens take a healthy lead, he will probably come off early with a huge Champions League tie against Madrid soon.
Bobb wins possession off Eze and helps City break forward quickly down the right side of Palace's half, with De Bruyne winning an early corner. The Belgium international looks for Haaland in the middle, but Andersen heads it clear.
GOALLLL! MATETA SCORES! 1-0 PALACE! What a start for the Eagles! Stones gifts possession to the hosts, who play some quick passes in their own half before Wharton rolls a throughball into Mateta. The striker races down the right side of the box before directing his low shot across the goal and into the net off the left post.
That’s a brilliant pass from Wharton, who finds the run of Mateta. He still has plenty to do but shows great composure to beat Ortega.
Palace had failed to score in any of their last four Premier League home games against City, with Luka Milivojevic in April 2019 the last Eagles player to score against them at Selhurst Park.
WIDE! Huge chance for City to level! De Bruyne has possession on the right and whips a fantastic delivery into the box. Gvardiol stays up from a previous corner and attempts to direct a header on target, but puts his shot wide of the right post.
Palace have another chance to break forward with speed, but Wharton's pass down the left to Eze is wayward of the winger. However, he collects it well and tries to play a one-two with Ayew, who sends the ball out for a goal-kick.
POST! City go close this time! Bobb and Lewis combine on the right before the latter of the pair slides a brilliant pass through to Alvarez, who bursts into the box. The Argentine then drives a low strike across the goal, but it hits the left post before Henderson punches it away.
SAVE! What a stop from Henderson to keep Palace ahead! A cross into the Eagles box is headed away by Lerma as far as Rodri, who directs a first-time effort from just inside the box towards the bottom-right corner. It looks to be heading into the net, but Henderson gets down well to push it around the post.
GOALLLL! WHAT A HIT FROM DE BRUYNE! 1-1! Grealish gets his first chance to dribble at Munoz down the left before his low cross is blocked. However, it rebounds straight to De Bruyne, who switches possession onto his right foot inside the box before curling his perfect strike into the top-right corner.
City have scored 29 first-half goals in 31 games, only Arsenal (33) and Villa (31) have scored more in the Premier League this season. Henderson made a top save to deny Rodri earlier, but that goal from De Bruyne was simply unstoppable.
City have controlled possession so far and have had 87.1 per cent of the ball. Mateta scored the opener for the Eagles, but he is the only player in a home shirt who is staying forward and looks isolated. Any early nerves for Guardiola are probably gone.
OVER! Mitchell lofts a cross into the box from the left, with Ortega getting there before Mateta to punch it away. It drops to Ayew on the edge, but he lashes his effort well over the bar.
ANOTHER SAVE! Henderson is keeping Palace in the contest. De Bruyne spins on the ball just inside the Eagles' half and slides a wonderful throughball into the path of Haaland, who is one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, Henderson comes out quickly to block his strike.
De Bruyne is appearing all over the pitch, this time getting down the left to get on the end of Grealish's pass down the wing. The captain races towards the byline before his low cross is blocked.
Munoz slides into Grealish, who stays down and looks hurt. It’s a worrying moment for City after Grealish's injury record this season, but he is back on his feet without needing medical treatment.
City have a good spell of possession before Dias breaks their short passing routine with a fantastic switch from left to right over to Bobb. He is in space inside the Palace box, but the ball hits his arm and a free-kick is given. Bobb looks frustrated with himself.
City continue to control the possession, with Palace packing their defensive third to stop the visitors from progressing. Rodri then attempts to chip a pass forward to Alvarez, but Mitchell matches his run to head it away.
Grealish wins a corner off Ward on the right, with the Palace defender heading De Bruyne's first corner behind before then clearing the next one from the same side well away. Two poor deliveries from De Bruyne, which is a surprise due to his quality. There hasn’t been a shot for over 10 minutes.
Gvardiol strolls out of the defence, arriving at the edge of the Palace box before seeing his shot blocked at close range. The Croatian defender and Stones are getting further forward to help increase the City pressure.
Palace are sitting deep, meaning that anytime they win possession or put in a strong tackle, they struggle to keep the ball. Rodri attempts to slide a clever pass down the right side of the box to Haaland, but Mitchell is strong and gets a foot across to poke the ball behind for a corner.
WIDE! Alvarez has time and space just to the right outside Palace’s box, but he fires his effort across the goal and wide of the left post.
De Bruyne shows his invention with a wonderful chipped pass over the Palace defence and down the right side of the box to Bobb, who is in plenty of space. However, he doesn’t race towards the spinning ball. As a result, when it hit the floor, it bounced straight out for a goal-kick. Bobb puts his arms in the air as he realises that it was his fault.
A rare Palace attack, with Mateta getting to the ball before Rodri down the right, and curling a low cross into the box. However, it is too close to Ortega, who collects it well.
BAR! What a chance for Palace to take the lead again! Rodri loses possession in City's half, and Ayew races forward before firing his right-footed effort against the top of the bar!
City have lost control in the last couple of minutes and haven’t been as relaxed in possession. Lewis has a shot on the edge of Palace's box but blasts his effort straight at Henderson.
CHANCE! Munoz breaks down the right for Palace and cuts the ball back to the edge of the box to Ayew, but his touch is very poor. Hughes collects it but is tackled by Rodri, who sends a blind pass back to Ortega. Mateta puts the goalkeeper under pressure. However, the City man turns away from the Frenchman. Ederson would be proud of that one!
Haaland has been involved in seven goals in his last six away appearances for City in the Premier League, scoring four and assisting three. However, he’s not scored in any of his previous four such games, his longest run without a goal on the road in the competition. He has only had seven touches so far!
There will be three minutes of additional time.
Gvardiol thunders into Ayew's back and gives away a free-kick just inside City's half. He then shows his frustrations to the referee, who gives him a yellow card for dissent.
HALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 1-1 MANCHESTER CITY
De Bruyne scored a fantastic equaliser to cancel out Mateta's opener, with Palace and City level at 1-1 heading into half-time. The Eagles took the lead inside three minutes through Mateta, who raced onto the end of Wharton's brilliant throughball and drove his low strike against the left post and into the net. City levelled less than four minutes later through De Bruyne. The Belgium international collected the ball on the left and whipped a brilliant strike into the top-right corner. Haaland was then denied by a sharp stop from Henderson, with Ayew crashing the bar from the hosts.
Palace struggled to create anything against Bournemouth in their last outing, but they have shown signs of promise against Premier League champions City. The Eagles have registered an xG of 0.75 from their three shots, with their only effort on target coming from Mateta's goal. Henderson has also been brilliant, making four saves. As for City, they created an xG of 0.99 from their nine efforts. Guardiola's men have had 75.9 per cent of the possession. However, they have struggled at times to find a way through Palace's rigid defensive structure and have been vulnerable on the counter. Haaland might be getting frustrated up front after having just seven touches, but with De Bruyne in the side, he could be found at any moment.
City make a change to their defence before the restart. Gvardiol struggled at times before the break and is being replaced by Akanji.
City get the ball rolling again. The visitors must win to keep the pressure on title rivals Arsenal and Liverpool, who will be delighted with the score so far.
GOALLLL! LEWIS SCORES! 2-1 CITY! The visitors take the lead for the first time! Grealish has possession on the left, getting to the byline before lifting a cross into the box. Andersen gets there but flicks a header straight to Lewis, who crashes his strike into the bottom-left corner.
City have scored 11 goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half, only Tottenham (15) have scored more in the Premier League this season. It’s also the second time Lewis has scored this season, with both coming against the Eagles!
There is a small penalty shout for City, with De Bruyne's cross from the left getting blocked by Andersen's arm. However, when the ball struck the arm of the Palace defender, it was close to his body and in a natural position.
Palace now need to stay in the contest and not concede again. Glasner will be furious with conceding just after half-time, especially as Lewis was free inside the box!
Wharton lofts a pass down the right for Munoz, who breaks down the wing and waits for support. He has plenty of time to pick the right option, but his cutback goes straight to Alvarez. The Eagles won’t get many chances, meaning they must do better when they get forward.
CHANCE! What an opportunity for City to take the lead! De Bruyne knocks a header into Haaland, but the ball is just too far in front of the striker. He keeps the attack alive and plays it back to Alvarez in the middle. However, his low strike deflects off Andersen and goes wide of the right post.
De Bruyne is over a corner on the right and drives a low pass to Grealish on the edge of the box. He has time and space, taking one touch before lashing his effort over the top of the bar.
City have been strong since the restart and have not allowed Palace to get into the contest. They have stopped the Eagles from having a shot whilst keeping 70.3 per cent of the possession and eight touches in the opposition box. If City score again, it would be difficult to see Palace from getting any points.
De Bruyne has possession on the left and plays a one-two with Grealish. He then looks at the goal and goes for an ambitious strike from range, curling his effort towards the top-right corner but over the bar. However, after his goal earlier, there would be no surprise if that went in!
Grealish, De Bruyne and Haaland all combine with some quick passes in tight areas before the ball goes out to Bobb on the right. He switches possession onto his left foot and looks for Haaland with a cross, but it is headed away.
Mateta is shown his fifth yellow card of the season after a heavy tackle on Bobb.
Eze has netted five goals in eight home games for Palace but hasn’t been able to make an impact today and is coming off for Schlupp.
GOALLL! HAALAND SCORES! 3-1 CITY! That should be game over! City are patient in possession and wait for an opening, with Grealish rolling a reversed pass down the left through to De Bruyne on the byline. The captain then sends a cutback straight to Haaland, who scores from close range.
De Bruyne adds an assist to his goal. He beats the offside trap to get onto Grealish's pass and instinctively finds Haaland in the middle with a fantastic ball into the forward.
Palace came from two goals behind to draw with City earlier in the season, but have struggled to put City under any pressure.
GOALLL! DE BRUYNE SCORES AGAIN! 4-1 CITY! De Bruyne and Grealish play a clever one-two on the left, allowing the England International to get to the byline before cutting the ball back to Rodri. He taps it to De Bruyne, who thunders his low strike into the bottom-left corner.
Rodri spots the run of De Bruyne and plays a simple pass into his feet, allowing the captain to thunder his effort past Henderson. One more goal would see City move to the top of the Premier League.
Palace cannot get out of their own half, with City desperate to score again. Haaland battles past a crowd down the left side of the box and fires it across, but the hosts clear it away.
City are leading comfortably, allowing Rodri to be given a rest ahead of their Champions League tie against Real Madrid. Kovacic replaces him in the midfield.
Mateta scored Palace's opener inside three minutes but has not been able to make any sort of impact in the second half. Edouard takes his place up front.
There is a boost for Palace, with Olise returning from injury. He comes on for Ayew.
Alvarez has had a quiet performance and is now coming off for Nunes.
There is a change at full-back for Palace, with Clyne coming on for Mitchell.
City continue to retain possession and are playing it around with ease. Olise is trying to make an impact but cannot win the ball off the visitors. Foden might have been introduced if the score was closer. However, he might be rested by Guardiola.
Grealish loses possession in his own half, which allows Munoz to win the ball. He bursts down the right, but his pass inside is poor and City clear it away.
OFF THE LINE! Olise pokes the ball away from Akanji inside City's defensive third and rolls a pass into Edouard, who has a clear view of the goal inside the box. His shot deflects off Dias and is heading in, but Stones clears it off the line.
Ahamada hasn’t started for Palace but makes his 25th appearance off the bench, replacing Hughes in the midfield.
Grealish hasn’t registered a goal or an assist for City but will be delighted with his performance on the left side of the attack. He has had 66 touches, won three fouls and combined with De Bruyne brilliantly. He is recently back from injury and will play a huge role for City, who are still in three competitions.
GOALLL! EDOUARD SCORES! Palace get one back, with the hosts trailing 4-2! Ahamada drives through the middle of the pitch before playing a pass down the left to Schlupp, who whips a low cross into the box. Edouard gets in front of his marker and pokes his shot in from close range.
Three Palace substitutes combined for the goal, with Schlupp finding Edouard with a wonderful low cross.
CLOSE! Olise turns onto his left foot on the right and whips a clever cross towards the back post. Schlupp attacks it, but it goes just ahead of him and wide of the left post.
There will be seven minutes of additional time. A Palace goal would put City under serious pressure.
Ahamada does well to collect the ball on the left side of the box, bursting past Kovacic before curling his shot straight at Ortega.
De Bruyne scored twice and registered an assist but is now coming off for Silva. There is some serious depth on the City bench.
Andersen looks to unlock Olise down the right with a long pass forward, but Akanji gets in front of the Palace man and helps City retain possession.
Haaland and Lerma get into an altercation off the ball, with Lerma going down holding his face. There is a VAR check on the incident, but nothing comes of it.
FULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 2-4 MANCHESTER CITY
De Bruyne scored twice and registered an assist to help City beat Palace 4-2 at Selhurst Park. The Eagles took a shock lead inside three minutes when Mateta showed great composure to fire his low effort off the left post and into the net, but City quickly levelled through De Bruyne, who showed his quality with a thunderous strike into the top-right corner. The Citizens then took control in the second half. Lewis gave them the lead soon after the restart from close range before Haaland got onto the end of De Bruyne's cutback to score from close range. The captain then added his fourth of the contest with a powerful strike from the edge into the bottom-left corner. Edouard got one back for the hosts after coming off the bench, but the Eagles couldn’t mount a late comeback. City are up to second in the Premier League and face Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final before hosting Luton Town in the top-flight. It doesn’t get much easier for Palace, who travel to Liverpool. That's all for today, goodbye."	"Two second-half goals ended Brentford's nine-match winless run and move further clear of the Premier League relegation zone as they earned a 2-0 victory over rock-bottom Sheffield United.
An Oliver Arblaster own goal off Mikkel Damsgaard’s cross and a stoppage-time finish from Frank Onyeka saw Thomas Frank’s Bees pick up their first victory since February against Chris Wilder’s Blades at the Gtech Community Stadium.
It ends a rough stretch for the hosts, who had struggled since their 2-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 10 February, and puts further daylight between them and the bottom three – they now have a seven-point cushion.
But woes continue to mount for their visitors, who remain stuck at the foot of the table as they fight to secure their top-flight status.
How the match unfolded 
Both sides spurned opportunities inside the first 15 minutes, with Ben Brereton Diaz unable to fire off a finish after a barnstorming solo break, and Sergio Reguilon drifting a header across the bar from close quarters.
Vitaly Janelt also came near to the opener when he stung the palms of Blades 'keeper Ivo Grbic with an effort from 20 yards out, while Brereton Diaz and Damsgaard both blew chances when they failed to keep their respective strikes low.
Neal Maupay missed the best chance of the first half when a misplaced pass from Anel Ahmedhodzic put him one-on-one on goal, only for the Brentford forward to send his shot wide, while Yoane Wissa could not find a way to break the deadlock either shortly before the interval.
Brentford subsequently thought they had the lead just over nine minutes into the second period when Zanka slotted Mathias Jensen’s dipping free-kick past Grbic inside the box, only for the offside flag to be raised against him.
But the visitors finally cracked at the back when Arblaster stuck a leg out to desperately deal with Damsgaard’s dangerous ball after the Dane had cut loose on a run from midfield, only for the Blades player to divert it into the far corner of the net in the 63rd minute.
Damsgaard thought he had added a second when his smart volley was awarded on-pitch, but referee Sam Barrott overturned the decision after a VAR review that highlighted a foul in the box by Nathan Collins on Oli McBurnie.
Brentford ensured there would be no late fightback when Onyeka darted onto Kevin Schade’s ball from the left flank in the third minute of stoppage time and sent a fine finish past Grbic to seal the deal.
It has not been pleasant viewing for Brentford fans since they returned from the West Midlands with three points just over two months ago, with their side managing only four points in the interim.
Still, victory against their visitors on Saturday ensures they can likely look towards ensuring their Premier League status is preserved for another campaign and Brentford will hope to all but secure safety next weekend when they travel to Luton Town.
Ever since he returned to the club as Paul Heckingbottom’s successor, Chris Wilder has appeared to have the odds stacked against him to ensure Premier League safety for the Yorkshire club."	Team_4		"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_8 and Team_13 at Selhurst Park.\nPalace started well under new manager Oliver Glasner and beat Team_6 3-0 in his first match in charge, but the Eagles have since failed to win their last four games in the top flight (drawing two and losing two). Their 1-0 loss to Team_3 in their previous outing was particularly frustrating, with Eberechi Eze's potential opener disallowed for offside after a VAR check before Justin Kluivert struck the winner for the Cherries in the 79th minute. However, it would be a stretch to say Palace deserved anything out of the match at the Vitality Stadium after only creating an xG (expected goals) of 0.19 from their three shots. The Eagles are in 14th position in the Premier League and are eight points above the relegation zone with eight games remaining, meaning there is not much to play for, but Glasner will use the final part of the season to see who is in his plans for the next campaign.\nCity returned to winning ways in their previous match, beating Champions League hopefuls Team_2 4-1 after back-to-back draws with title rivals Team_11 and Team_1.\xa0Jhon Duran\xa0cancelled out Rodri's opener to level the score before Phil Foden netted a stunning hat-trick to extend City's unbeaten run in the top flight to 15 games and keep them within three points of table-toppers Team_11. Pep Guardiola's men will temporarily go above second-place Team_1 with a win. However, they will only move to the summit if they beat Palace by four goals or more. City will be confident of securing a positive result after winning six and drawing two of their last eight Premier League away matches against Palace, and will want to keep spirits high heading into their huge Champions League quarter-final first-leg tie against Real Madrid in Spain next week.\nTeam_8 (3-4-3): Dean Henderson; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Jefferson Lerma; Daniel Munnoz, Adam Wharton, Will Hughes, Tyrick Mitchell; Eberechi Eze, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew.\nTeam_8 SUBS: James Tomkins, Michael Olise, Jeffrey Schlupp, Nathaniel Clyne, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Remi Matthews, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh-Chibueze.\nTeam_13 (4-1-4-1): Stefan Ortega; Rico Lewis, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri; Oscar Bobb, Kevin De Bruyne, Julian Alvarez, Jack Grealish; Erling Haaland.\nTeam_13 SUBS: Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku, Bernardo Silva, Sergio Gomez, Manuel Akanji, Matheus Nunes, Ederson, Phil Foden, Mahamadou Susoho.\nPalace name the same side that started their 1-0 loss to Team_3 in their previous Premier League outing. However, Olise returns to the bench after missing the last seven matches through injury.\nCity make four alterations to the team that beat Villa 4-1 in their previous match. Despite scoring a hat-trick against the Lions, Foden drops onto the bench and is replaced by De Bruyne, who captains the side. Stones comes in for Akanji at centre-back, and Bobb is picked ahead of Doku on the right. Haaland appears up front and is in the side instead of Silva, meaning Alvarez drops further back. Ederson returns to the squad after getting injured against Team_11 last month, allowing Ortega to start again.\nPalace came from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with City in the reverse fixture in December. Only in 1992-93, 1994-95, and 2021-22 have they avoided defeat in both Premier League meetings with the Citizens in a season. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.\nPalace get this Premier League clash under way. The two teams switched sides before the start.\nIt will be interesting to see if Palace have a strong start, with the Eagles playing at home with an unchanged side and an extra day of rest compared to City. The visitors might look to build their way into the contest after making four switches. However, it is tough to disagree with Guardiola, who has led his side to a 25-match unbeaten run in all competitions. Haaland is back, but if the Citizens take a healthy lead, he will probably come off early with a huge Champions League tie against Madrid soon.\nBobb wins possession off Eze and helps City break forward quickly down the right side of Palace's half, with De Bruyne winning an early corner. The Belgium international looks for Haaland in the middle, but Andersen heads it clear.\nGOALLLL!\xa0MATETA SCORES! 1-0 PALACE! What a start for the Eagles! Stones gifts possession to the hosts, who play some quick passes in their own half before\xa0Wharton rolls a throughball into Mateta. The striker races down the right side of the box before directing his low shot across the goal and into the net off the left post.\nThat’s a brilliant pass from Wharton, who finds the run of Mateta. He still has plenty to do but shows great composure to beat Ortega.\nPalace had failed to score in any of their last four Premier League home games against City, with Luka Milivojevic in April 2019 the last Eagles player to score against them at Selhurst Park.\nWIDE! Huge chance for City to level!\xa0De Bruyne has possession on the right and whips a fantastic delivery into the box. Gvardiol stays up from a previous corner and attempts to direct a header on target, but puts his shot wide of the right post.\nPalace have another chance to break forward with speed, but\xa0Wharton's pass down the left to Eze is wayward of the winger. However, he collects it well and tries to play a one-two with Ayew, who sends the ball out for a goal-kick.\nPOST! City go close this time! Bobb and Lewis combine on the right before the latter of the pair slides a brilliant pass through to Alvarez, who bursts into the box. The Argentine then drives a low strike across the goal, but it hits the left post before Henderson punches it away.\nSAVE! What a stop from Henderson to keep Palace ahead! A cross into the Eagles box is headed away by Lerma as far as Rodri, who directs a first-time effort from just inside the box towards the bottom-right corner. It looks to be heading into the net, but Henderson gets down well to push it around the post.\nGOALLLL! WHAT A HIT FROM\xa0DE BRUYNE! 1-1!\xa0Grealish gets his first chance to dribble at Munoz down the left before his low cross is blocked. However, it rebounds straight to De Bruyne, who switches possession onto his right foot inside the box before curling his perfect strike into the top-right corner.\nCity have scored 29 first-half goals in 31 games, only Team_1 (33) and Villa (31) have scored more in the Premier League this season. Henderson made a top save to deny Rodri earlier, but that goal from De Bruyne was simply unstoppable.\nCity have controlled possession so far and have had 87.1 per cent of the ball. Mateta scored the opener for the Eagles, but he is the only player in a home shirt who is staying forward and looks isolated. Any early nerves for Guardiola are probably gone.\nOVER! Mitchell lofts a cross into the box from the left, with Ortega getting there before Mateta to punch it away. It drops to Ayew on the edge, but he lashes his effort well over the bar.\nANOTHER SAVE! Henderson is keeping Palace in the contest. De Bruyne spins on the ball just inside the Eagles' half and slides a wonderful throughball into the path of Haaland, who is one-on-one with the goalkeeper. However, Henderson comes out quickly to block his strike.\nDe Bruyne is appearing all over the pitch, this time getting down the left to get on the end of Grealish's pass down the wing. The captain races towards the byline before his low cross is blocked.\nMunoz slides into Grealish, who stays down and looks hurt. It’s a worrying moment for City after Grealish's injury record this season, but he is back on his feet without needing medical treatment.\nCity have a good spell of possession before Dias breaks their short passing routine with a fantastic switch from left to right over to Bobb. He is in space inside the Palace box, but the ball hits his arm and a free-kick is given. Bobb looks frustrated with himself.\nCity continue to control the possession, with Palace packing their defensive third to stop the visitors from progressing. Rodri then attempts to chip a pass forward to Alvarez, but Mitchell matches his run to head it away.\nGrealish wins a corner off Ward on the right, with the Palace defender heading De Bruyne's first corner behind before then clearing the next one from the same side well away. Two poor deliveries from De Bruyne, which is a surprise due to his quality. There hasn’t been a shot for over 10 minutes.\nGvardiol strolls out of the defence, arriving at the edge of the Palace box before seeing his shot blocked at close range. The Croatian defender and Stones are getting further forward to help increase the City pressure.\nPalace are sitting deep, meaning that anytime they win possession or put in a strong tackle, they struggle to keep the ball. Rodri attempts to slide a clever pass down the right side of the box to Haaland, but Mitchell is strong and gets a foot across to poke the ball behind for a corner.\nWIDE! Alvarez has time and space just to the right outside Palace’s box, but he fires his effort across the goal and wide of the left post.\nDe Bruyne shows his invention with a wonderful chipped pass over the Palace defence and down the right side of the box to Bobb, who is in plenty of space. However, he doesn’t race towards the spinning ball. As a result, when it hit the floor, it bounced straight out for a goal-kick. Bobb puts his arms in the air as he realises that it was his fault.\nA rare Palace attack, with Mateta getting to the ball before Rodri down the right, and curling a low cross into the box. However, it is too close to Ortega, who collects it well.\nBAR! What a chance for Palace to take the lead again! Rodri loses possession in City's half, and Ayew races forward before firing his right-footed effort against the top of the bar!\nCity have lost control in the last couple of minutes and haven’t been as relaxed in possession. Lewis has a shot on the edge of Palace's box but blasts his effort straight at Henderson.\nCHANCE! Munoz breaks down the right for Palace and cuts the ball back to the edge of the box to Ayew, but his touch is very poor. Hughes collects it but is tackled by Rodri, who sends a blind pass back to Ortega. Mateta puts the goalkeeper under pressure. However, the City man turns away from the Frenchman. Ederson would be proud of that one!\nHaaland has been involved in seven goals in his last six away appearances for City in the Premier League, scoring four and assisting three. However, he’s not scored in any of his previous four such games, his longest run without a goal on the road in the competition. He has only had seven touches so far!\nThere will be three minutes of additional time.\nGvardiol thunders into Ayew's back and gives away a free-kick just inside City's half. He then shows his frustrations to the referee, who gives him a yellow card for dissent.\nHALF-TIME: Team_8 1-1 Team_13\nDe Bruyne scored a fantastic equaliser to cancel out Mateta's opener, with Palace and City level at 1-1 heading into half-time. The Eagles took the lead inside three minutes through Mateta, who raced onto the end of Wharton's brilliant throughball and drove his low strike against the left post and into the net. City levelled less than four minutes later through De Bruyne. The Belgium international collected the ball on the left and whipped a brilliant strike into the top-right corner. Haaland was then denied by a sharp stop from Henderson, with Ayew crashing the bar from the hosts.\nPalace struggled to create anything against Team_3 in their last outing, but they have shown signs of promise against Premier League champions City. The Eagles have registered an xG of 0.75 from their three shots, with their only effort on target coming from Mateta's goal. Henderson has also been brilliant, making four saves. As for City, they created an xG of 0.99 from their nine efforts. Guardiola's men have had 75.9 per cent of the possession. However, they have struggled at times to find a way through Palace's rigid defensive structure and have been vulnerable on the counter. Haaland might be getting frustrated up front after having just seven touches, but with De Bruyne in the side, he could be found at any moment.\nCity make a change to their defence before the restart. Gvardiol struggled at times before the break and is being replaced by Akanji.\nCity get the ball rolling again. The visitors must win to keep the pressure on title rivals Team_1 and Team_11, who will be delighted with the score so far.\nGOALLLL! LEWIS SCORES! 2-1 CITY! The visitors take the lead for the first time! Grealish has possession on the left, getting to the byline before lifting a cross into the box. Andersen gets there but flicks a header straight to Lewis, who crashes his strike into the bottom-left corner.\nCity have scored 11 goals in the first 15 minutes of the second half, only Team_18 (15) have scored more in the Premier League this season. It’s also the second time Lewis has scored this season, with both coming against the Eagles!\nThere is a small penalty shout for City, with De Bruyne's cross from the left getting blocked by Andersen's arm. However, when the ball struck the arm of the Palace defender, it was close to his body and in a natural position.\nPalace now need to stay in the contest and not concede again. Glasner will be furious with conceding just after half-time, especially as Lewis was free inside the box!\nWharton lofts a pass down the right for Munoz, who breaks down the wing and waits for support. He has plenty of time to pick the right option, but his cutback goes straight to Alvarez. The Eagles won’t get many chances, meaning they must do better when they get forward.\nCHANCE! What an opportunity for City to take the lead! De Bruyne knocks a header into Haaland, but the ball is just too far in front of the striker. He keeps the attack alive and plays it back to Alvarez in the middle. However, his low strike deflects off Andersen and goes wide of the right post.\nDe Bruyne is over a corner on the right and drives a low pass to Grealish on the edge of the box. He has time and space, taking one touch before lashing his effort over the top of the bar.\nCity have been strong since the restart and have not allowed Palace to get into the contest. They have stopped the Eagles from having a shot whilst keeping 70.3 per cent of the possession and eight touches in the opposition box. If City score again, it would be difficult to see Palace from getting any points.\nDe Bruyne has possession on the left and plays a one-two with Grealish. He then looks at the goal and goes for an ambitious strike from range, curling his effort towards the top-right corner but over the bar. However, after his goal earlier, there would be no surprise if that went in!\nGrealish, De Bruyne and Haaland all combine with some quick passes in tight areas before the ball goes out to Bobb on the right. He switches possession onto his left foot and looks for Haaland with a cross, but it is headed away.\nMateta is shown his fifth yellow card of the season after a heavy tackle on Bobb.\nEze has netted five goals in eight home games for Palace but hasn’t been able to make an impact today and is coming off for\xa0Schlupp.\nGOALLL! HAALAND SCORES! 3-1 CITY! That should be game over! City are patient in possession and wait for an opening, with Grealish rolling a reversed pass down the left through to De Bruyne on the byline. The captain then sends a cutback straight to Haaland, who scores from close range.\nDe Bruyne adds an assist to his goal. He beats the offside trap to get onto Grealish's pass and instinctively finds Haaland in the middle with a fantastic ball into the forward.\nPalace came from two goals behind to draw with City earlier in the season, but have struggled to put City under any pressure.\nGOALLL! DE BRUYNE SCORES AGAIN! 4-1 CITY! De Bruyne and Grealish play a clever one-two on the left, allowing the England International to get to the byline before cutting the ball back to Rodri. He taps it to De Bruyne, who thunders his low strike into the bottom-left corner.\nRodri spots the run of De Bruyne and plays a simple pass into his feet, allowing the captain to thunder his effort past Henderson. One more goal would see City move to the top of the Premier League.\nPalace cannot get out of their own half, with City desperate to score again. Haaland battles past a crowd down the left side of the box and fires it across, but the hosts clear it away.\nCity are leading comfortably, allowing Rodri to be given a rest ahead of their Champions League tie against Real Madrid. Kovacic replaces him in the midfield.\nMateta scored Palace's opener inside three minutes but has not been able to make any sort of impact in the second half. Edouard takes his place up front.\nThere is a boost for Palace, with Olise returning from injury. He comes on for Ayew.\nAlvarez has had a quiet performance and is now coming off for Nunes.\nThere is a change at full-back for Palace, with Clyne coming on for Mitchell.\nCity continue to retain possession and are playing it around with ease. Olise is trying to make an impact but cannot win the ball off the visitors. Foden might have been introduced if the score was closer. However, he might be rested by Guardiola.\nGrealish loses possession in his own half, which allows Munoz to win the ball. He bursts down the right, but his pass inside is poor and City clear it away.\nOFF THE LINE! Olise pokes the ball away from Akanji inside City's defensive third and rolls a pass into Edouard, who has a clear view of the goal inside the box. His shot deflects off Dias and is heading in, but Stones clears it off the line.\nAhamada hasn’t started for Palace but makes his 25th appearance off the bench, replacing Hughes in the midfield.\nGrealish hasn’t registered a goal or an assist for City but will be delighted with his performance on the left side of the attack. He has had 66 touches, won three fouls and combined with De Bruyne brilliantly. He is recently back from injury and will play a huge role for City, who are still in three competitions.\nGOALLL!

93466	Luton	Arsenal	2023-12-05	Kenilworth Road, Luton	11112.0	Samuel Barrott	"Welcome to live text commentary of Burnley v West Ham United in the Premier League.
Vincent Kompany’s Burnley side come into this match on the back of the worst home start in the history of the English top-flight, having lost six out of six matches at Turf Moor so far this campaign. West Ham have a tricky run coming up, so David Moyes will want to take advantage of the Hammers' positive form before the international break and head back to East London with nothing but all three points in the bag.
BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O'Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Luca Koleosho; Zeki Amdouni, Jay Rodriguez
Subs: Lawrence Vigouroux, Connor Roberts, Hjalmar Ekdal, Josh Cullen, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Michael Obafemi, Nathan Redmond, Anass Zaroury, Aaron Ramsey
WEST HAM (4-2-3-1): Alphonse Areola; Emerson, Nayef Aguerd, Kurt Zouma, Vladimir Coufal; James Ward-Prowse, Edson Alvarez; Lucas Paqueta, Tomas Soucek, Mohammed Kudus; Danny Ings
Subs: Lukas Fabianski, Aaron Cresswell, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Angelo Ogbonna, Thilo Kehrer, Pablo Fornals, Maxwel Cornet, Said Benrahma, Divin Mubama
We’ll start with the big team news… No Bowen for West Ham. He misses out through injury after pulling out of the England squad with a knee issue last week. It comes as a blow for Moyes as the forward has scored in all six of West Ham’s away games in the league this season. Ings makes his first league start of the campaign - which comes against his old club - and is West Ham’s only change from their previous win at Nottingham Forest.
As for Burnley, they’re unchanged from the defeat to Arsenal last time out. It looks as though Kompany has set his side up in two banks of four, with Gudmundsson and Koleosho deployed on either flank. Berge starts alongside Brownhill in central midfield, with the latter on the scoresheet last time out at Emirates Stadium.
The Hammers need to pick up as many points as possible before trying to navigate their way through a tricky Christmas period if they’re going to sustain their push for a European finish. They face Tottenham and Arsenal on the road and host Man United in December, before kickstarting their new year with a test against Brighton. As for Burnley, they’re in desperate need of a result. Rooted to the bottom of the table with just four points after 12 games, they’ve lost their last five in the league.
Both sets of players have emerged from the tunnel at Turf Moor and we're almost ready for kick-off.
Here we go! Amdouni gets the ball rolling for Burnley and the first half is underway.
Paqueta dinks a cross towards an unmarked Soucek in the box but the midfielder doesn't really know what to do with the ball and softly guides it towards goal with his head. Trafford comes off his line to claim it comfortably.
Gudmundsson takes on a shot on the edge of the box following a Burnley corner but it's straight at Areola.
West Ham fly forward but Vitinho crucially cuts out Soucek's pass out wide to Paqueta making a run down the left.
The West Ham fans behind Areola's goal are in fine voice as they enjoy their positive start to the season. Turf Moor is generally quite flat apart from the noisy section of travelling fans.
Paqueta can't find the onrushing Ings. Gudmundsson gives the ball away initially and works hard to block the Brazilian's attempted pass towards Ings on the right.
Berge makes a driving run towards the West Ham box but he runs into a cluster of white shirts. Vitinho picks up the ball and looks for Amdouni in the box, but he's quickly dispossessed.
CHANCE FOR BURNLEY! Rodriguez fizzes a ball across the six-yard box towards Amdouni at the back post but the ball is ever so slightly ahead of the Swiss striker's path. Rodriguez was unselfish, he could have taken the shot on himself.
West Ham have failed to score in three of their last four Premier League away games against Burnley. Their 0-0 draw last time out in December 2021 is their only clean sheet in eight visits to Turf Moor in the competition.
Koleosho makes a couple of positive runs towards Coufal down Burnley's left flank. The West Ham defender does enough to keep him at bay for now, but there are some positive signs for Burnley in the opening stages.
It's been a really open start to the game. It's been end-to-end in the early exchanges and both teams have had a sniff at goal. Burney have probably had the best chance of the game so far.
Kudus runs onto an overhit Coufal through ball and kicks it out for a throw-in rather than a goal kick to keep Burnley in their own half.
In possession, Burnley are playing patient football. They're waiting for an opening and not rushing themselves going forward. As I say that, Berge plays a long ball over the top which Koleosho brings down exceptionally before running into a group of defenders on the edge of the box and losing the ball.
Both teams have had a sniff at goal, but neither have created any real chances yet with nearly 25 minutes gone.
Burnley are enjoying a good spell, popping the ball around as the game settles. Amdouni chases down Areola, who gets the ball clear just in the nick of time.
BIG SAVE FROM AREOLA! Amdouni slips the ball to Koleosho arriving into the box on the left, he opens his body up for a shot on his right foot but Areola makes a strong save to his right at the near post.
West Ham have won their last seven Premier League games against promoted sides – their longest such run in the competition – while they’ve also won their last 10 against sides starting the day bottom of the table.
Paqueta drives through the Burnley midfield and Beyer trips him to earn the first booking of the match.
O'Shea miscontrols the ball and Paqueta is on him straight away. As the last defender, O'Shea dives in to get the ball clear as quickly as possible, which he does, but catches the winger in the meantime. Paqueta wants a foul but he won't get one, play on.
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR BURNLEY! Berge whips in an inviting cross to Amdouni at the back post, who steers the ball wide with a header.
The ball drops to Vitinho around 25 yards from goal. He takes a first-time strike but skews it well over the bar.
POSSIBLE BURNLEY PENALTY! Koleosho drives into the box and Coufal sticks his leg out to stop him. He seems to catch the winger's foot as Koleosho falls to the floor. VAR initially sends Samuel Barrott to the monitor, but then the decision changes to no penalty.
Alvarez talked his way into the book before the Burnley penalty was overturned.
Aguerd was also booked for dissent.
Burnley didn't get the penalty, but one thing it has done is give the home crowd a much-needed boost. It's the loudest it's been all game as we close in on half-time.
Kudus brings down Koleosho on the left and Burnley have a free-kick in a good position.
Beyer heads the free-kick wide. There will be one minute of added time at the end of the first half.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 0-0 WEST HAM
It's goalless at the break between Burnley and West Ham. As Burnley try to end their barren run of six consecutive defeats, the Clarets have looked the better side. They had a great chance to open the scoring when Koleosho thumped an effort straight at Areola but the big talking point was the possible penalty for Burnley. Koleosho, who caused a lot of problems for Coufal in the first half, skipped past the right-back before his legs were clipped which sent him to the floor. VAR had a quick check but deemed no pitchside review was necessary. It was harsh because they’ve certainly been given, but nonetheless, Kompany will be pleased with that first 45 minutes.
Both teams have enjoyed positive spells of possession during the first half but only Burnley have really made the opposition goalkeeper work. West Ham need to find a way of breaking down this stubborn Burnley defence, but first, they have to work the ball through the lines and get it to Ings' feet. He’s making a return to his former club and would surely love to score, so it’s up to Moyes to get him more involved. As for Burnley, more of the same is needed from Kompany's side. They could be more clinical, but with the way they're playing, they're bound to get another chance. A big second half for both teams coming up!
West Ham get the ball rolling for the second half.
Risky from Burnley! Trafford passes the ball to Taylor right on the edge of the Burnley box and the first wave of the West Ham attack is quickly onto him, but they play their way out of danger.
PENALTY FOR BURNLEY! Koleosho makes a tricky run into the box and Kudus is clumsy as he treads on his foot. The referee points straight to the spot!
There is a quick VAR check, but this isn't going to be overturned. It will be a penalty.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOALLL!!! What a huge moment this could be for Burnley! Rodriguez drills the ball down the middle from the spot and Burnley are ahead!
A big goal for Burnley and Rodriguez. He's now scored 19 of his last 20 penalty kicks - a brilliant record from the spot!
West Ham are looking to attack straight away and Coufal delivers a ball to the front post but Beyer stabs it away.
Ward-Prowse produces a fierce shot from 10 yards out but Berge blocks it from close range. West Ham have a corner.
The ball drops to Paqueta on the half-volley from a corner but he sends it well over the bar.
HUGE SAVE FROM AREOLA! Amdouni does really well to snatch the ball from Aguerd and drive at goal but Areola is down quickly to deny him at the front post. Burnley have a spring in their step!
Paqueta goes down with an injury, clutching his rib cage after a tussle with Berge. Burnley fans aren't happy with the Brazilian who is escorted off the pitch by the physio.
West Ham are preparing to make a couple of changes.
Paqueta is back on the pitch and is getting a chorus of boos from the home fans. He then plays a delicious ball out wide to Emerson as West Ham try and force an attack.
Mubama comes on in place of Ings, who has not enjoyed a happy return to Turf Moor eight years after leaving the club.
It will be a double change for West Ham as Alvarez is replaced by Benrahma. That might have something to do with the fact that he's on a yellow card.
West Ham have lost seven of their last 10 Premier League away games (W2 D1), conceding at least twice in each defeat. Indeed, since the start of last season only Nottingham Forest (18) have lost more Premier League away games than the Hammers (16).
Coufal searches for Mubama with a curling cross from deep but his delivery is headed clear.
Amdouni is hauled down on the halfway line as Coufal and Zouma chase him. The former is booked but it looked as though it was the latter that made the contact.
Benrahma is nearly through on goal as Mubama sends a direct ball over the top of the Burnley defence but Berge - the only player back - is excellently positioned to mop up on the halfway line.
Berge splits the West Ham defence with a pass through the middle, but Rodriguez is offside. Everyone inside Turf Moor is urging Burnley to move the ball around quicker!
Burnley make their first change as Ramsey replaces Amdouni. The Burnley striker put himself about today and played well.
Nearly an instant impact from Ramsey! He drives into the box and shoots from the right but his effort is just off target.
Burnley are winless in their last four Premier League meetings with West Ham (D2 L2), with the last two games in 2021-22 both ending in draws.
Ward-Prowse has more assists than any other Premier League player in all competitions this season and now West ham have a corner. They really need him to produce.
Trafford punches the set-piece away, much to Turf Moor's delight. Just over 10 more minutes for Burnley to hang on!
Coufal whips in a delivery and Zouma heads towards goal but he doesn't get enough purchase on the ball as Trafford comfortably catches the centre-back's tame effort.
Koleosho departs to a chorus of cheers from the Burnley faithful. He's been their best player in this match and is replaced by Zaroury.
BENRAHMA COMES SO CLOSE! Kudus plays the ball out wide to him and the Burnley fans are up in arms because they think he's handled it. Nevertheless, play continues and Benrahma cuts inside before sending a shot across the face of goal which flashes agonisingly wide of the post.
Gudmunds­son is subbed off and Cullen takes his place. The Icelandic winger had created the most chances in the match in an impressive display.
GOOOOOOOOOALLL!!! WEST HAM ARE LEVEL! Kudus does superbly to beat a cluster of maroon shirts on the right before producing a dangerous cross towards the front post from the byline, which Mubama stabs towards goal as the ball goes in off O'Shea!
The West Ham fans are in full voice now. They'll believe they can go on and win this.
There will be at least seven additional minutes added on. West Ham want to finish this match strongly and are on top in the closing stages.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLL!!!! WEST HAM ARE IN FRONT! It's another sensational ball in from Kudus for Soucek at the back post, who volleys the Hammers ahead in the 91st minute!
Ward-Prowse slips the ball to Kudus on the right, who hesitates in front of Taylor before shifting the ball onto his left and curling in a pinpoint cross for Soucek to slam home. What a signing the Ghanaian is turning out to be - he has single-handedly turned this game on its head!
West Ham are now sitting back a bit. They've done their job up front and Moyes will be desperate to hold on for three points here.
West Ham have won their last seven Premier League games against promoted sides – their longest such run in the competition – while they’ve also won their last 10 against sides starting the day bottom of the table. They look set to continue those streaks here! Burnley are stunned.
Brownhill sends in a hopeful, lofted cross for Taylor who is completely unmarked at the back of the penalty area, but it looks as though he's lost the ball in the air as his touch takes it out of play.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 1-2 WEST HAM
And breathe! Another late Premier League comeback means West Ham come away from Turf Moor with all three points. It was all about Kudus in the second half, as he produced two excellent crosses which ended up in the back of the net, courtesy of an O'Shea own goal to cancel out Rodriguez's opener and a brilliant volley from Soucek to complete the comeback. You can't help but feel sorry for Burnley, who looked to have done enough for their first points at home this season, but it wasn't to be. It's now seven consecutive home defeats for Kompany’s side, who remain rooted to the foot of the table, while West Ham end their league run of three away matches without victory. Burnley will have the chance to quickly put their home form right when they welcome Sheffield United to Turf Moor next weekend, while West Ham turn their attention to Europe and travel to Serbia to face TSC Backa Topola on Thursday. Thank you for following our live coverage. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Declan Rice’s header in the seventh minute of stoppage time secured a dramatic victory as Arsenal beat Luton Town 4-3 to go five points clear at the top.
In a pulsating encounter at Kenilworth Road, both sides went in front only to be pegged back, but it was the Gunners who provided the decisive blow to extend their winning run in the league to four matches.
Arsenal controlled the early proceedings, but Luton aimed to assert their presence in the match with a number of strong challenges.
However, the Gunners would punish poor play from Luton to take the lead on 20 minutes.
A heavy backpass from Amari'i Bell forced goalkeeper Thomas Kaminski to kick out for a throw. Gabriel Jesus took it quickly and found Bukayo Saka, who on his 200th appearance in all competitions for Arsenal, cut the ball back from the byline for Gabriel Martinelli to sweep into the bottom corner.
Five minutes later, Luton equalised when Gabriel Osho got on the end of an Alfie Doughty corner to power his header beyond David Raya for his first Premier League goal.
With half-time approaching, Arsenal restored their advantage once more when Ben White’s first-time cross was nodded in by Gabriel Jesus.
The Brazilian’s first goal in eight Premier League matches and only second of the season made him the 11th different player to have scored Arsenal's last 11 goals in the competition.
Four minutes after the break, Luton were back level for the second time and this goal was almost a carbon-copy of their first.
Another corner from Doughty was not dealt with by Raya and he was out-jumped by Elijah Adebayo, who headed in.
With Kenilworth Road already rocking, Ross Barkley then put the hosts ahead on 57 minutes with a low left-footed shot that squirmed beneath Raya.
But Luton’s lead would last just three minutes as Kai Havertz continued his fine form in front of goal when he dinked the ball over the advancing Kaminski from a clever Gabriel Jesus pass for his third goal in his last four matches in all competitions.
Substitute Leandro Trossard twice went close twice to putting Arsenal back in front, with one shot being deflected over while he fired his second narrowly wide.
The match looked to be heading towards a draw but Rice headed Martin Odegaard’s cross into the bottom corner to spark joyous scenes in the away end.
It was the fifth time in 15 Premier League matches this season that Arsenal have scored a game-changing goal after the 84th minute, and the third in stoppage time.
Meanwhile, it's the first time since a 5-3 win over Chelsea in October 2011 that the Gunners have won a Premier League away match in which they've conceded three or more goals.
Arsenal now have 36 points, with rivals Liverpool and Manchester City both in action on Wednesday, when they will hope to close the gap on the Gunners.
Luton remain 17th on nine points, two clear of the bottom three."		Team_1	"[""Welcome to live text commentary of Team_6 v Team_19 in the Premier League.\nVincent Kompany’s Team_6 side come into this match on the back of the worst home start in the history of the English top-flight, having lost six out of six matches at Turf Moor so far this campaign. Team_19 have a tricky run coming up, so David Moyes will want to take advantage of the Hammers' positive form before the international break and head back to East London with nothing but all three points in the bag.\nTeam_6 (4-4-2): James Trafford; Vitinho, Dara O'Shea, Jordan Beyer, Charlie Taylor; Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill, Johann Berg Gudmundsson, Luca Koleosho; Zeki Amdouni, Jay Rodriguez\nSubs: Lawrence Vigouroux, Connor Roberts, Hjalmar Ekdal, Josh Cullen, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Michael Obafemi, Nathan Redmond, Anass Zaroury, Aaron Ramsey\nTeam_19 (4-2-3-1): Alphonse Areola; Emerson, Nayef Aguerd, Kurt Zouma, Vladimir Coufal; James Ward-Prowse, Edson Alvarez; Lucas Paqueta, Tomas Soucek, Mohammed Kudus; Danny Ings\nSubs: Lukas Fabianski, Aaron Cresswell, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Angelo Ogbonna, Thilo Kehrer, Pablo Fornals, Maxwel Cornet, Said Benrahma, Divin Mubama\nWe’ll start with the big team news… No Bowen for Team_19. He misses out through injury after pulling out of the England squad with a knee issue last week. It comes as a blow for Moyes as the forward has scored in all six of Team_19’s away games in the league this season. Ings makes his first league start of the campaign - which comes against his old club - and is Team_19’s only change from their previous win at Team_16.\nAs for Team_6, they’re unchanged from the defeat to Team_1 last time out. It looks as though Kompany has set his side up in two banks of four, with Gudmundsson and Koleosho deployed on either flank. Berge starts alongside Brownhill in central midfield, with the latter on the scoresheet last time out at Emirates Stadium.\nThe Hammers need to pick up as many points as possible before trying to navigate their way through a tricky Christmas period if they’re going to sustain their push for a European finish. They face Team_18 and Team_1 on the road and host Man United in December, before kickstarting their new year with a test against Team_5. As for Team_6, they’re in desperate need of a result. Rooted to the bottom of the table with just four points after 12 games, they’ve lost their last five in the league.\nBoth sets of players have emerged from the tunnel at Turf Moor and we're almost ready for kick-off.\nHere we go! Amdouni gets the ball rolling for Team_6 and the first half is underway.\nPaqueta dinks a cross towards an unmarked Soucek in the box but the midfielder doesn't really know what to do with the ball and softly guides it towards goal with his head. Trafford comes off his line to claim it comfortably.\nGudmundsson takes on a shot on the edge of the box following a Team_6 corner but it's straight at Areola.\nTeam_19 fly forward but Vitinho crucially cuts out Soucek's pass out wide to Paqueta making a run down the left.\nThe Team_19 fans behind Areola's goal are in fine voice as they enjoy their positive start to the season. Turf Moor is generally quite flat apart from the noisy section of travelling fans.\nPaqueta can't find the onrushing Ings. Gudmundsson gives the ball away initially and works hard to block the Brazilian's attempted pass towards Ings on the right.\nBerge makes a driving run towards the Team_19 box but he runs into a cluster of white shirts. Vitinho picks up the ball and looks for Amdouni in the box, but he's quickly dispossessed.\nCHANCE FOR Team_6! Rodriguez fizzes a ball across the six-yard box towards Amdouni at the back post but the ball is ever so slightly ahead of the Swiss striker's path. Rodriguez was unselfish, he could have taken the shot on himself.\nTeam_19 have failed to score in three of their last four Premier League away games against Team_6. Their 0-0 draw last time out in December 2021 is their only clean sheet in eight visits to Turf Moor in the competition.\nKoleosho makes a couple of positive runs towards Coufal down Team_6 left flank. The Team_19 defender does enough to keep him at bay for now, but there are some positive signs for Team_6 in the opening stages.\nIt's been a really open start to the game. It's been end-to-end in the early exchanges and both teams have had a sniff at goal. Burney have probably had the best chance of the game so far.\nKudus runs onto an overhit Coufal through ball and kicks it out for a throw-in rather than a goal kick to keep Team_6 in their own half.\nIn possession, Team_6 are playing patient football. They're waiting for an opening and not rushing themselves going forward. As I say that, Berge plays a long ball over the top which Koleosho brings down exceptionally before running into a group of defenders on the edge of the box and losing the ball.\nBoth teams have had a sniff at goal, but neither have created any real chances yet with nearly 25 minutes gone.\nTeam_6 are enjoying a good spell, popping the ball around as the game settles. Amdouni chases down Areola, who gets the ball clear just in the nick of time.\nBIG SAVE FROM AREOLA! Amdouni slips the ball to Koleosho arriving into the box on the left, he opens his body up for a shot on his right foot but Areola makes a strong save to his right at the near post.\nTeam_19 have won their last seven Premier League games against promoted sides – their longest such run in the competition – while they’ve also won their last 10 against sides starting the day bottom of the table.\nPaqueta drives through the Team_6 midfield and Beyer trips him to earn the first booking of the match.\nO'Shea miscontrols the ball and Paqueta is on him straight away. As the last defender, O'Shea dives in to get the ball clear as quickly as possible, which he does, but catches the winger in the meantime. Paqueta wants a foul but he won't get one, play on.\nANOTHER CHANCE FOR Team_6! Berge whips in an inviting cross to Amdouni at the back post, who steers the ball wide with a header.\nThe ball drops to Vitinho around 25 yards from goal. He takes a first-time strike but skews it well over the bar.\nPOSSIBLE Team_6 PENALTY! Koleosho drives into the box and Coufal sticks his leg out to stop him. He seems to catch the winger's foot as Koleosho falls to the floor. VAR initially sends Samuel Barrott to the monitor, but then the decision changes to no penalty.\nAlvarez talked his way into the book before the Team_6 penalty was overturned.\nAguerd was also booked for dissent.\nTeam_6 didn't get the penalty, but one thing it has done is give the home crowd a much-needed boost. It's the loudest it's been all game as we close in on half-time.\nKudus brings down Koleosho on the left and Team_6 have a free-kick in a good position.\nBeyer heads the free-kick wide. There will be one minute of added time at the end of the first half.\nHALF-TIME: Team_6 0-0 Team_19\nIt's goalless at the break between Team_6 and Team_19. As Team_6 try to end their barren run of six consecutive defeats, the Clarets have looked the better side. They had a great chance to open the scoring when Koleosho thumped an effort straight at Areola but the big talking point was the possible penalty for Team_6. Koleosho, who caused a lot of problems for Coufal in the first half, skipped past the right-back before his legs were clipped which sent him to the floor.

93581	Brentford	Chelsea	2024-03-02	Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford	17140.0	Jarred Gillett	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Liverpool and Luton Town at Anfield!
This game was supposed to take place at the weekend, but due to Liverpool's involvement in the EFL Cup final on Sunday, it's been moved forward. The Reds have the chance to extend their lead at the top of the league ahead of the rest of the fixtures and can go four points clear of Manchester City with another win here. They've only lost one of their last 14 games in all competitions (W10 D3), but they've won back-to-back matches since their defeat to Arsenal. Their form at home is a force to be reckoned with, though, as they haven't lost at Anfield in any of their last 24 outings there (W19 D5).
As for Luton, they've slipped back into the relegation zone after Everton's draw with Crystal Palace on Monday, but if they avoid defeat here, they'll leapfrog the Toffees once more. After going on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions at the start of the year (W3 D3), they've since lost their last two against Sheffield United and Manchester United, though they were unlucky to come out of the latter empty-handed.
LIVERPOOL STARTING XI (4-3-3): Caoimhin Kelleher; Conor Bradley, Jarell Quansah, Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez; Alexis Mac Allister, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch; Harvey Elliott, Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz.
LIVERPOOL SUBS: Bobby Clark, Adrian, Kaide Gordon, Andy Robertson, Jayden Danns, Trey Nyoni, Ibrahima Konate, Kostas Tsimikas, James McConnel.
LUTON TOWN STARTING XI (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Teden Mengi, Gabriel Osho, Amari'i Bell; Chiedozie Ogbene, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Ross Barkley, Alfie Doughty; Carlton Morris, Tahith Chong; Cauley Woodrow.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: Andros Townsend, Reece Burke, Issa Kabore, Dan Potts, Zack Nelson, Jordan Clark, Tim Krul, Luke Berry, Pelly-Rudock Mpanzu.
Jurgen Klopp makes five changes from Liverpool's win over Brentford on Saturday, as Quansah, Gomez, Gravenberch, Elliott and Gakpo are all brought in. Robertson and Konate drop to a young bench. Diogo Jota is out with a knee injury, while Curtis Jones and Darwin Nunez aren't risked after also going off in that game. Mohamed Salah also isn't in the squad.
Despite losing to United last time out, Rob Edwards was clearly pleased with what he saw from his team as he names an unchanged line-up here. Woodrow continues to lead the line after Elijah Adebayo picked up a hamstring injury in the warm-up of that game.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Lokonga gets the game under way for Luton!
Liverpool win an early corner and it's worked to Mac Allister on the edge of the box. He curls an inviting cross to the far post, but Doughty heads it out for another corner. This one comes to nothing.
Kelleher sends it long over the top and Luton switch off, allowing Diaz to run onto it on the edge of the box. He can't get it out of his feet in time to get an early shot away though, and Mengi gets across to knock it away.
WIDE! Diaz has made a really bright start to this game, and Elliott plays it inside to him, and he just spins away from Osho to get a sight of goal. He does get a shot away this time, but fires it wide of the far post.
After a slow start to the game, Luton are advancing forward for the first time and Ogbene gets away from two Liverpool players to hook in a cross from the right. He's looking for Morris, but the captain can't get on the end of it.
Elliott goes out to take another corner, but it's cleared just in front of Quansah. It only goes as far as Mac Allister, who works it back out to Elliott, but the defender is caught on his heels this time.
Chong has acres of space in the middle of the field, and he spots Doughty to his left. He gets in front of Bradley to fizz a dangerous ball across the face of goal, but none of his team-mates are there to meet it.
GOOOAAALLL!!! OGBENE SCORES! Luton have the lead at Anfield! It comes from a throw-in on the left, and Doughty holds off Quansah to cushion it into Chong's path. The angle is tight, but he still goes for goal. It goes through Kelleher's legs, but the keeper gets enough on it to stop it from crossing the line. It loops up though, and Ogbene nods it in from the far post. 1-0 Luton!
Lokonga isn't strong enough as he tries to bring down Gakpo, and he's left on the floor by the Dutchman, who drives forward. He has options either side, but goes for goal himself, earning a corner as his shot deflects over the bar.
Luton are getting everybody back inside their own penalty area whenever Liverpool win a corner, and there's no space for the Reds. Bradley sees a cross blocked, and Van Dijk can't pick out a team-mate when he recycles it on the opposite flank.
Doughty steps across Gravenberch to try and stop him, but when the Dutchman gets away, he also pulls him back by the arm. The winger is shown the first yellow card of the game.
Bell's clearance is charged down by Gomez, which takes it straight to Gakpo, and he deftly flicks it into Elliott's path on the left of the box. He can't bring it under control quickly enough though, and Lokonga takes no risks by putting his laces through the clearance.
It's a lovely throughball from Chong into the box for Woodrow, but Kelleher is alert and rushes out to intercept it. He then throws it out to Mac Allister to set him on the counter, but he can't escape Barkley.
Luton have made a good start to this game, and Edwards will be delighted with what he's seen so far. However, history doesn't favour them in this exact fixture, as they've never beaten Liverpool in a league game at Anfield (P14 - W8 D6).
Luton have started to get a little sloppy in the last couple of minutes, and have given it away in their own half a couple of times. Mac Allister makes the latest interception, but his throughball to Gakpo is too close to Kaminski.
CHANCE! Gomez is allowed to advance and the Luton players just drop back, allowing him to keep going. When he gets to the edge of the box, he tries his luck, curling his shot towards the far-top corner, but it flies wide.
SAVE! Bell carries it out from the back, only to run into Van Dijk high up the pitch, and the Liverpool captain nicks it off him before picking out Diaz's run. He cuts inside from the left and drills his shot through Mengi's legs, but it's held by Kaminski.
Luton win a free-kick on the right, but they waste a good chance to put it into the box. It comes back to Barkley twice after he initially takes it short, but when he switches out to the opposite flank, Dought just drifts offside.
WHAT A CHANCE! Diaz starts the move, but he has to wait a while to get it back until Endo scoops a good pass into the box. The Colombian peels off the back of Mengi to reach it, but pokes it wide of the near post on the stretch.
Barkley's pass out to Ogbene is a bit too heavy, but the winger is able to keep it alive before returning it to the midfielder. Barkley does swing a cross in this time, but it's a tame one that is easily caught by Kelleher.
OVER! Diaz has had all of Liverpool's best chances here, and he sees another one go begging. Luton give it away in their own half again, with the forward driving to the edge of the box before letting fly, but his shot sails over the bar.
It's getting a bit stuck in midfield at the moment, with both sides struggling to keep hold of it for more than a couple of seconds. Gravenberch eventually trips Chong when his frustration gets the better of him, and Luton win a free-kick.
BLOCK! It's well won back by Bradley before Mac Allister's hopeful clearance sets Gravenberch away through the middle. He helps it out to Diaz once more, but Bell recovers brilliantly to slide in and block his latest attempt.
Another corner for the Reds is comfortably cleared by Luton, but Mac Allister manages to latch onto the second ball. He touches it back to Elliott, who is the latest Liverpool player to have a go from range, but this one flies over the bar too.
There's a collision between Woodrow and Quansah as they go up for an aerial challenge, with the defender getting caught on the side of his head. Woodrow is booked for the challenge.
Mac Allister nicks it off Osho on the halfway line and quickly gets it out to Diaz. He helps it onto Elliott, who has every intention of returning the one-two, but Luton swarm around him to stop the pass from getting through.
Into the first of two added minutes here, with Liverpool still attempting to get an equaliser before the break. Kelleher sends it long to Bradley, who flicks it onto Gakpo, but his cross is too close to Kaminski.
CHANCE! Ogbene has space to burst into down the right after knocking it past Gomez, and he curls an early cross into the box to Woodrow. He meets it awkwardly on the volley as he jumps, but it loops over the crossbar.
HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-1 LUTON TOWN.
Ogbene's early goal gives Luton a 1-0 lead over Liverpool at half-time. The Hatters scored just 12 minutes into the game after breezing through the Reds' defence, and Chong's tight-angled shot was saved by Kelleher, but it looped off the goalkeeper for Ogbene to head in at the far post. Liverpool have certainly had their chances, mainly from long range, but Diaz has come closest to getting them on the scoresheet, sending two great efforts wide of Kaminski's right post.
Edwards will be thrilled with what he's seen from his side so far - despite having few chances, they've looked a threat on the break, but more importantly, they've defended as a unit to frustrate Liverpool. Klopp didn't look too happy on the sideline, though his team did react well to going behind so early. He'll be looking for a more clinical performance after the break, especially since he has no senior attacking options to hand on the bench.
There is a change at the break for Luton. Lokonga is the player making way after picking up a knock in the first half, with Mpanzu on in his place.
Liverpool get us back under way for the second half!
Mengi thinks he's done enough to hold off Diaz, but a foul is actually given against the Luton man. The Liverpool fans want a booking for the defender, but it's a member of their coaching staff who's booked for dissent for his reaction on the sidelines.
There's so much space for Elliott on the edge of the box when Endo slides it into him, but he chooses to take on another shot from range. He drags at it, sending it well wide of the far post.
PENALTY SHOUT! Mengi makes a brilliant block to deny Diaz from a tight angle, but Liverpool quickly work it back into the box. The Colombian looks to square it into the middle this time when it hits Osho's arm, which is just behind him, but the referee awards a corner.
Liverpool's corner causes a scramble in the box, with nobody sure where it's going to fall next. Gakpo reacts quickest in the end to poke it towards goal, but Mpanzu clears before the offside flag goes up.
Mac Allister picks out Elliott's overlapping run down the right, and he floats a good cross into a still-crowded penalty area. Gakpo gets a flick on, but he can't direct it towards goal.
GOOD SAVE! Chong steps in to shield it from Elliott in the box, but Gakpo is on hand to nick it off him. He takes it around the winger before drilling a low shot at the near post, but Kaminski gets down smartly to push it wide.
GOOOAAALLL!!! VAN DIJK EQUALISES! It's been coming from Liverpool, and their captain steps up! They finally manage to make something of one of their many corners as Mac Allister whips it into the middle, and Van Dijk darts in front of his marker to meet it. He gets power on the header, and Kaminski can't keep it out. 1-1!
It's a brilliant delivery from Mac Allister as he puts it straight onto Van Dijk's head.
GOOD SAVE! Liverpool aren't letting up the pressure here, and Bradley finds a pocket of space just inside the box. He keeps his shot low as he hits it down the middle, and Kaminski keeps it out with his feet.
Luton are making their second change in answer to that Liverpool equaliser as Woodrow is replaced by Townsend.
GOOOAAALLL!!! GAKPO SCORES! And just like that, Liverpool lead! It comes down the right side once more as it's clipped into the near post by Mac Allister, and Gakpo just peels away from his defender to meet it. It's another great header as he flicks it past Kaminski and into the back of the net. 2-1 Liverpool!
That's two assists in just over two minutes for Mac Allister, who picks out another good cross into the box.
GREAT SAVE! Luton just can't get out of their own box at the moment, and Gakpo is in on goal again. He surges past Bell down the right of the box, but his low shot is turned away by Kaminski for a corner.
KAMINSKI SAVES AGAIN! Mac Allister has found his range from the corner flag and he whips another wonderful cross into the box to pick out Van Dijk. He sends another powerful header on goal, and the goalkeeper scoops it away from his line.
After a frantic spell of the game, Edwards is making another change to try and settle things in midfield. Chong is taken off, with Jordan Clark on in his place.
Mengi has his arms around Gakpo to stop him from turning past him, and Liverpool win a free-kick. Elliott swings it into the box, and Osho just does enough to stop it from reaching Gakpo.
CHANCE! Bradley is dispossessed on the halfway line, and Barkley sets off on a rare Luton attack in this second half. He slides it forward for Doughty, who tries to catch out Kelleher by chipping it towards the far post from a tight angle, but it's deflected wide.
Liverpool are making their first change now, and Bradley goes off to a standing ovation from the home crowd. He's replaced by Robertson, which means that Gomez will switch to right-back.
Osho is caught on the ball, and Gakpo profits, but his low cross is half-cleared by Mengi. He only gets it as far as Elliott, but his pullback is too short for Diaz on the far side.
GOOOAAALLL!!! DIAZ SCORES! That should do it for Liverpool! After missing a couple of good chances in the first half, Diaz makes no mistake this time. Luton gives it away in their own half, with Robertson cutting out a switch to Ogbene, and his interception falls to the Colombian's feet. He drives into the box before rifling his shot past Kaminski at the near post. 3-1 Liverpool!
Robertson reads it well and was alert to dart in front of Ogbene, and cushion it into Diaz's path.
SAVE! Luton have a chance to get themselves back into this game as it's sent long to Doughty, but Kelleher rushes out to close him down. The winger manages to square it to Townsend, but the goalkeeper quickly gets back in position to block it.
Luton's final change of the game is an enforced one. Doughty was caught by Kelleher during that last attack when the goalkeeper closed him down, so he can't carry on. Kabore replaces him, which will see Ogbene switch out to the left for the end of the game.
GREAT SAVE! Diaz finds space in the box once more, but with two Luton players bearing down on him, he has to take this chance quickly. He pokes it towards the near post, and Kaminski gets down smartly to tip it away.
Barkley drags at Elliott's shoulder before sliding in from behind to nick the ball off him. He did catch the youngster with the follow-through, and it earns him a yellow card, much to his frustration.
There's another change for Liverpool now, as Bobby Clark is brought on in place of Gravenberch.
Liverpool are just slowing the pace of the game down at the moment, and although Luton are attempting to press, it's half-hearted. Kelleher does misplace a pass to Robertson, but Mpanzu can't make anything of it.
CHANCE! Barkley is caught on the ball in the centre circle, and Endo is quick to slide it forward to Gakpo. He has time to take it into the box, but tries his luck from range instead, and curls it wide of the near post.
Gomez gets a handful of Ogbene's shirt, and the winger decides to pull up to show it to the referee. It works, with Luton getting a free-kick, and Gomez getting a booking.
In Salah (19), Jota (14), Nunez (13), Gakpo (11), and Diaz (10), Liverpool are the first club in Europe's big-five leagues to have five players reach 10+ goals in all competitions this season.
Luton are enjoying a good spell of possession here, but it's all in their own half as they try to slow things down a little bit. They're in no hurry to push forward, though Liverpool are pressing them high.
Quansah clips the back of Barkley's heel, taking his boot off, and Luton have a free-kick in a good position. Barkley steps up to take it but curls his effort straight into the wall.
The home crowd are on their feet to give a standing ovation to the players making way. Diaz, who scored the final goal, which looks like it will seal the three points, is replaced by Danns, who makes his debut.
And Mac Allister, who set up the first two goals, goes off for McConnell.
Kabore catches McConnell with a late tackle and becomes the fourth player to go into the referee's book.
GOOOAAALLL!!! ELLIOTT SCORES! Osho intercepts Robertson's pass, only to give it away to Danns. He slides it into the box for Gakpo, but Mengi takes it off his toe. Elliott races onto the loose ball and whips a shot past Kaminski and into the back of the net. 4-1 Liverpool!
We're into eight minutes of added time here as Luton attempt to pull another goal back. Mpanzu slides it down the right for Kabore to chase, but he's caught on his heels and can't keep it in play.
Quansah is allowed to carry the ball a long way before he tries to set McConnell away down the right. Ogbene does enough to stop that from happening but puts it straight out of play to gift possession back to Liverpool.
Luton are pushing forward again to try and give their fans something to cheer late on. Townsend swings in a corner, but Kelleher rushes off his line to punch it away.
FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 4-1 LUTON TOWN.
Liverpool's brilliant second-half display sees them come from behind to beat Luton 4-1. The visitors had a wonderful first half and took the lead just 12 minutes in as Ogbene headed in the rebound of Chong's saved effort. The Reds pushed to equalise but couldn't find a way through a compact Luton side. That changed after the break though, and two goals in just over two minutes flipped the game on its head. Van Dijk levelled things up with a thumping header before Gakpo flicked in their second. Diaz then punished Luton for giving the ball away inside their own half by rifling it into the back of the net, with Elliott rounding things off late on with a lovely curling effort in the 90th minute. It's a win that lifts Liverpool four points clear at the top of the table, though they have played a game more than the teams below them. Next up for them is the EFL Cup final against Chelsea on Sunday. That loss means that Luton stay in the bottom three, and they don't play again until their FA Cup fifth-round tie against Manchester City on Tuesday. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Chelsea’s hopes of European football took another hit as they failed to beat Brentford for a fifth successive match as the two West London clubs battled to a 2-2 draw.
Thomas Frank’s team had led until the 83rd minute but Axel Disasi headed home his first goal since the opening weekend against Liverpool to earn a point.
How the match unfolded
There was no Neal Maupay for Brentford as Yoanne Wissa took the Frenchman’s place in attack for the Bees. Keane Lewis-Potter and Ben Mee were also out as Mads Roerslev and Nathan Collins returned.
Mauricio Pochettino made one change, with Trevoh Chalobah replacing Raheem Sterling.  
Chelsea assumed early control of the match, holding 72 per cent possession in the first half but struggled to create clear-cut opportunities. 
Nicolas Jackson came close to opening the scoring after receiving a through-ball from Enzo Fernandez and rounding Mark Flekken, but his weak shot was cleared by Zanka.
However five minutes later the striker redeemed himself with a leaping headed goal between the two Brentford centre-backs from a well-placed Malo Gusto cross.
Thomas Frank’s side were much more combative in the second half and it soon paid off as Roerslev scored his first goal in over two years, smashing home a loose ball after Sergio Reguilion’s effort had been blocked.
Brentford went close soon after as Vitaly Janelt’s low driven effort from the edge of the box sliced through the legs of Chalobah to hit a post.
The home team continued to attack and were rewarded by Wissa’s spectacular goal. Frank Onyeka’s reflex flick-up in the area was converted by Congolese’s bicycle kick.
But with seven minutes remaining, Disasi earned Chelsea a point as he headed in a good curling cross by Cole Palmer who received the ball from a corner.
The point takes Brentford above Everton into 15th on 26 points, six clear of the bottom three. Chelsea remain 11th with 36 points.

Team_4	Team_7	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Team_11 and Team_12 at Anfield!\nThis game was supposed to take place at the weekend, but due to Team_11 involvement in the EFL Cup final on Sunday, it's been moved forward. The Reds have the chance to extend their lead at the top of the league ahead of the rest of the fixtures and can go four points clear of Team_13 with another win here. They've only lost one of their last 14 games in all competitions (W10 D3), but they've won back-to-back matches since their defeat to Team_1. Their form at home is a force to be reckoned with, though, as they haven't lost at Anfield in any of their last 24 outings there (W19 D5).\nAs for Luton, they've slipped back into the relegation zone after Team_9 draw with Team_8 on Monday, but if they avoid defeat here, they'll leapfrog the Toffees once more. After going on a six-game unbeaten run in all competitions at the start of the year (W3 D3), they've since lost their last two against Team_17 and Team_14, though they were unlucky to come out of the latter empty-handed.\nTeam_11 STARTING XI (4-3-3): Caoimhin Kelleher; Conor Bradley, Jarell Quansah, Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez; Alexis Mac Allister, Wataru Endo, Ryan Gravenberch; Harvey Elliott, Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz.\nTeam_11 SUBS: Bobby Clark, Adrian, Kaide Gordon, Andy Robertson, Jayden Danns, Trey Nyoni, Ibrahima Konate, Kostas Tsimikas, James McConnel.\nTeam_12 STARTING XI (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Teden Mengi, Gabriel Osho, Amari'i Bell; Chiedozie Ogbene, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Ross Barkley, Alfie Doughty; Carlton Morris, Tahith Chong; Cauley Woodrow.\nTeam_12 SUBS: Andros Townsend, Reece Burke, Issa Kabore, Dan Potts, Zack Nelson, Jordan Clark, Tim Krul, Luke Berry, Pelly-Rudock Mpanzu.\nJurgen Klopp makes five changes from Team_11 win over Team_4 on Saturday, as Quansah, Gomez, Gravenberch, Elliott and Gakpo are all brought in. Robertson and Konate drop to a young bench. Diogo Jota is out with a knee injury, while Curtis Jones and Darwin Nunez aren't risked after also going off in that game. Mohamed Salah also isn't in the squad.\nDespite losing to United last time out, Rob Edwards was clearly pleased with what he saw from his team as he names an unchanged line-up here. Woodrow continues to lead the line after Elijah Adebayo picked up a hamstring injury in the warm-up of that game.\nThe teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!\nLokonga gets the game under way for Luton!\nTeam_11 win an early corner and it's worked to Mac Allister on the edge of the box. He curls an inviting cross to the far post, but Doughty heads it out for another corner. This one comes to nothing.\nKelleher sends it long over the top and Luton switch off, allowing Diaz to run onto it on the edge of the box. He can't get it out of his feet in time to get an early shot away though, and Mengi gets across to knock it away.\nWIDE! Diaz has made a really bright start to this game, and Elliott plays it inside to him, and he just spins away from Osho to get a sight of goal. He does get a shot away this time, but fires it wide of the far post.\nAfter a slow start to the game, Luton are advancing forward for the first time and Ogbene gets away from two Team_11 players to hook in a cross from the right. He's looking for Morris, but the captain can't get on the end of it.\nElliott goes out to take another corner, but it's cleared just in front of Quansah. It only goes as far as Mac Allister, who works it back out to Elliott, but the defender is caught on his heels this time.\nChong has acres of space in the middle of the field, and he spots Doughty to his left. He gets in front of Bradley to fizz a dangerous ball across the face of goal, but none of his team-mates are there to meet it.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! OGBENE SCORES! Luton have the lead at Anfield! It comes from a throw-in on the left, and Doughty holds off Quansah to cushion it into Chong's path. The angle is tight, but he still goes for goal. It goes through Kelleher's legs, but the keeper gets enough on it to stop it from crossing the line. It loops up though, and Ogbene nods it in from the far post. 1-0 Luton!\nLokonga isn't strong enough as he tries to bring down Gakpo, and he's left on the floor by the Dutchman, who drives forward. He has options either side, but goes for goal himself, earning a corner as his shot deflects over the bar.\nLuton are getting everybody back inside their own penalty area whenever Team_11 win a corner, and there's no space for the Reds. Bradley sees a cross blocked, and Van Dijk can't pick out a team-mate when he recycles it on the opposite flank.\nDoughty steps across Gravenberch to try and stop him, but when the Dutchman gets away, he also pulls him back by the arm. The winger is shown the first yellow card of the game.\nBell's clearance is charged down by Gomez, which takes it straight to Gakpo, and he deftly flicks it into Elliott's path on the left of the box. He can't bring it under control quickly enough though, and Lokonga takes no risks by putting his laces through the clearance.\nIt's a lovely throughball from Chong into the box for Woodrow, but Kelleher is alert and rushes out to intercept it. He then throws it out to Mac Allister to set him on the counter, but he can't escape Barkley.\nLuton have made a good start to this game, and Edwards will be delighted with what he's seen so far. However, history doesn't favour them in this exact fixture, as they've never beaten Team_11 in a league game at Anfield (P14 - W8 D6).\nLuton have started to get a little sloppy in the last couple of minutes, and have given it away in their own half a couple of times. Mac Allister makes the latest interception, but his throughball to Gakpo is too close to Kaminski.\nCHANCE! Gomez is allowed to advance and the Luton players just drop back, allowing him to keep going. When he gets to the edge of the box, he tries his luck, curling his shot towards the far-top corner, but it flies wide.\nSAVE! Bell carries it out from the back, only to run into Van Dijk high up the pitch, and the Team_11 captain nicks it off him before picking out Diaz's run. He cuts inside from the left and drills his shot through Mengi's legs, but it's held by Kaminski.\nLuton win a free-kick on the right, but they waste a good chance to put it into the box. It comes back to Barkley twice after he initially takes it short, but when he switches out to the opposite flank, Dought just drifts offside.\nWHAT A CHANCE!

Ogbene does enough to stop that from happening but puts it straight out of play to gift possession back to Team_11.\nLuton are pushing forward again to try and give their fans something to cheer late on. Townsend swings in a corner, but Kelleher rushes off his line to punch it away.\nFULL-TIME: Team_11 4-1 Team_12.\nTeam_11 brilliant second-half display sees them come from behind to beat Luton 4-1. The visitors had a wonderful first half and took the lead just 12 minutes in as Ogbene headed in the rebound of Chong's saved effort. The Reds pushed to equalise but couldn't find a way through a compact Luton side. That changed after the break though, and two goals in just over two minutes flipped the game on its head. Van Dijk levelled things up with a thumping header before Gakpo flicked in their second. Diaz then punished Luton for giving the ball away inside their own half by rifling it into the back of the net, with Elliott rounding things off late on with a lovely curling effort in the 90th minute. It's a win that lifts Team_11 four points clear at the top of the table, though they have played a game more than the teams below them. Next up for them is the EFL Cup final against Team_7 on Sunday. That loss means that Luton stay in the bottom three, and they don't play again until their FA Cup fifth-round tie against Team_13 on Tuesday. That's all for today, goodbye!""]"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93503	Brentford	Wolves	2023-12-27	Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford	17109.0	Andy Madley	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Aston Villa and Sheffield United at Villa Park.
Villa host Sheffield United in a game where they will be hoping to continue their sensational run of form at home. The Midlands club have won each of their last 15 Premier League home games, which is the longest run in their league history. Unai Emery’s side have also had plenty of joy against today’s opponents and are unbeaten in their last 14 home league games against the newly-promoted outfit (W8 D6). A win would see Villa climb to the top of the Premier League table, even if temporarily, with Liverpool and Arsenal set to face each other this weekend.
Sheffield United head to Villa Park in search of their first victory away from home in the Premier League this season. The Blades have endured a difficult start to life back in England’s top flight, and have won just once in their last six matches (D1 L4). Chris Wilder was recently appointed as manager and the Yorkshire side will be desperate to see the experienced boss turn things around, and a victory away to Emery’s men could see them climb off the bottom of the table and into 18th.
ASTON VILLA (4-4-1-1): Emiliano Martinez; Lucas Digne, Clement Lenglet, Ezri Konsa, Matty Cash; John McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Jacob Ramsey, Leon Bailey; Moussa Diaby; Ollie Watkins.
ASTON VILLA SUBS: Diego Carlos, Alex Moreno, Calum Chambers, Nicolo Zaniolo, Jhon Duran, Leander Dendoncker, Filip Marschall, Tim Iroegbunam, Tommi O’Reilly.
SHEFFIELD UNITED (5-3-2): Wes Foderingham; Yasser Larouci, Jack Robinson, Auston Trusty, George Baldock, Jayden Bogle; Oliver Norwood, Anis Ben Slimane, Vinicius Souza; Andre Brooks, Cameron Archer.
SHEFFIELD UNITED SUBS: Adam Davies, John Fleck, Gustavo Hamer, Max Lowe, James McAtee, Oliver McBurnie, Ben Osborn, Luke Thomas, Benie Traore.
Emery has made four changes from Villa’s victory over Brentford last time out. In defence, Digne and Lenglet come into the side, with Diego Carlos and Pau Torres dropping out. Boubacar Kamara also misses out due to suspension, while Moreno drops to the bench, with Luiz and Bailey earning a place in the starting XI.
Meanwhile, Wilder has made five alterations from the Blades’ 2-0 defeat away to Chelsea in the Premier League. Anel Ahmedhodzic has failed to make the matchday squad after starting in their last fixture. Robinson comes in to replace him at the back. On the left-hand side of defence, Larouci is named in the XI with Lowe dropping to the bench. Elsewhere, Hamer, McBurnie, and McAtee all among the substitutes, with Baldock, Norwood, and Slimane coming in.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Archer gets the game under way for Sheffield United at Villa Park!
Diaby produces a neat turn just outside the penalty area, and Trusty brings him down. The referee awards a free-kick, and it's a matter of inches outside of the box. Luiz and Digne are standing over it and the former lays it off for the latter, but his whipped shot goes high and wide and out for a goal-kick. A wasted opportunity there.
McGinn receives a pass in the middle of the pitch and wastes no time trying to find Watkins in behind the defensive line. The Scottish midfielder slightly overhits it and Foderingham rushes off his line to collect. It's unlikely to be the only time the Villa striker looks to make that run, using his pace to his benefit.
A switched ball finds Bailey and he looks to take on Trusty. The Jamaican winger cuts in on his left and drives into the box, before spotting Diaby on the overlap. He takes a touch and sends a low cross into the penalty area, but the assistant referee has his flag up for offside and Wilder's men have a free-kick.
Villa work the ball well on the left and Ramsey finds the run of Digne who drives into the penalty area. He clips it towards the back post and Watkins falls to the ground after colliding with Souza. The Villa supporters want a penalty, and VAR is now checking it!
After a short delay, the referee has waved play on and there will be no penalty. Instead, the Villans have a corner. It's delivered into the box and once again, a Villa player goes to the ground. This time it's Konsa at the back post, and VAR is checking for yet another potential penalty! However, the officials have decided it won't be a penalty this time either.
Villa have dominated the early proceedings, attempting 102 passes to Sheffield United's 19. The Villans have had 84.1 per cent of the possession with two shots and might consider themselves slightly unfortunate not to have had a penalty. Wilder's side appear happy to sit back and try and absorb the pressure.
Chance! Villa look to break down the right-hand side with Bailey, who spots the run of Diaby inside the box, laying the ball into his path. The French international shoots immediately, looking to catch Foderingham out, but the Sheffield United goalkeeper makes a smart stop to deny him. Wilder's side allowed Bailey far too much room to create on the right.
This time Villa look to attack down the left as Digne and Watkins link up well, but the latter loses possession and the Blades are able to clear. Emery's side have predominantly looked to get at their opponents on the right-hand side with Bailey and Cash, while Diaby has also drifted wide to create an overload.
Bailey receives out wide and Cash bursts down the right-hand side on the overlap. The Villa right-back is found and looks to deliver into the box, but it's deflected behind for a corner. McGinn is there to take and sends a deep cross towards the back post. Konsa comes flying out of nowhere, but he can't guide his header on target and it flies behind.
Brooks dispossesses Cash deep inside the Aston Villa half and the hosts are in trouble. The Sheffield United attacker tries to find a team-mate in the box, but his cross is poor and Villa regain possession. The Blades will need to make the most of these little opportunities if they want to get something out of this game.
Norwood makes a heavy, unnecessary challenge on Luiz in the middle of the pitch and the referee awards a free-kick. He'll certainly consider himself fortunate not to have had his name taken for a booking. The Brazilian midfielder looks in a bit of discomfort, but shortly after, he's back on his feet.
The Blades have managed to complete just 50 per cent of their passes in the first half so far. Wilder will need to get his side to look after the ball better, with Sheffield United surrendering possession regularly, giving Villa plenty of chances to attack.
Villa have a corner after some good work by McGinn, who is standing over it ready to deliver. He whips it towards the back post and Lenglet is there to nod it down into the path of Watkins. The English striker takes a wild swing at it in and around the penalty spot, but he sends his strike flying over the bar. He was slightly off balance, so it wasn't a simple chance.
Ramsey finds Watkins who slows the play down and waits for his team-mates. He lays it into the path of Luiz who strikes it and it deflects out wide to McGinn. The Villa midfielder tries to deliver into the box, but it cannons off a defender and out for a corner. McGinn will take... but it comes to nothing.
Diaby has drifted out wide and looks to get one-on-one with Trusty on the right-hand side. He dances past his marker and makes his way into the penalty area, before cutting back onto his left and clipping a cross towards the back post, but the Blades are able to head it away from danger.
Emery's men are appealing for a penalty once again! McGinn receives the ball in midfield and fires a pass into the path of Watkins inside the penalty area. The Villa striker takes a touch and falls to the ground, with Baldock challenging behind him. However, the referee waves play on. The Villa Park faithful aren't happy!
Villa have managed to touch the ball inside their opponent's box 18 times since the game got underway. However, Emery's side have tested Foderingham between the sticks just once, so the Villans need to show a little more creativity in the final third if they want to open the scoring.
Once again, Villa try and create an overload on the right-hand side, with Diaby hugging the touchline before finding the overlapping run of Cash. The Polish right-back carries the ball into the box and looks to cut it back for a team-mate, but Sheffield United are able to clear the danger. Emery's side are lacking that cutting edge at the moment.
McGinn tries to find the run of Watkins in behind the Blades' defence, but Robinson is there to snuff out the danger. Wilder's side now look to break, but Cash makes a foul and United now have a chance to throw some bodies forward from a free-kick. Foderingham goes long, but nothing comes of it and Villa regain possession.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of two minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
HALF-TIME: ASTON VILLA 0-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Aston Villa and Sheffield United go into the break at 0-0. It's been a game with very few talking points so far as Emery's side have grown increasingly frustrated as the game has gone on. The Blades are sitting deep and absorbing the pressure, looking to hit Villa on the break. The hosts might feel they should have had a penalty in the opening 45 minutes, with VAR called into action on multiple occasions, but the referee is yet to point to the spot. The Midlands outfit will need to show a little more creativity in the second half if they want to break the deadlock.
Villa have enjoyed plenty of the ball so far, managing to have 78.2 per cent of the possession. However, they have been unable to turn their dominance into creating any clear-cut chances, producing just 0.44 expected goals (xG) since the game got under way. Wilder's side are yet to attempt a shot on goal, so they will have to show a little more attacking intent if they want to snatch a winner in the second half. Emery might be considering switching things up in the final third shortly after the break - could Zaniolo be the man to help them open the scoring?
Diaby gets the second half under way for Aston Villa at Villa Park!
Villa have a throw-in deep inside the opposition half, which is worked into the middle to McGinn. He shifts it to his right to Cash who finds Diaby, and Emery's side remain patient keeping possession. It eventually comes to Lenglet who clips the ball over the top after spotting the run of Digne, but his cross deflects behind for a corner.
The Blades look to counter with Larouci, but Bailey brings him down inside the Villa half. The referee awards him the first booking of the game.
Larouci now goes into the book for a foul on Bailey, with Villa having a chance from a free-kick inside the United half.
Luiz carries the ball through midfield and feeds it out wide to Cash on the right-hand side. The Villa right-back tries to find the run of Bailey who has burst beyond the opposition defence, but it dribbles straight into the arms of Foderingham and United are able to clear the danger. Emery's side are lacking ideas at the moment.
Villa are enjoying plenty of possession in the second half but are finding it incredibly difficult to break the Blades down. Emery's side need to show a little more creativity in the final third, and they're growing increasingly frustrated with their lack of chances since the break.
Wilder opts to take off Larouci after his earlier yellow, with Lowe coming on in his place.
It's an alteration in attack from Wilder, with Hamer entering the fray with Brooks making his way to the bench.
GOOOOOAAAALLL!! 1-0 ASTON VILLA!! The Midlands outfit finally making their dominance pay! Baldock fails to clear from a corner and Watkins pounces, playing a one-two with Ramsey. Watkins then fires a cross towards the back post where Bailey is waiting, and he slams the ball into the back of the net! But wait... VAR is checking it!
NO GOAL! Bailey's finish has been disallowed. Ramsey was adjudged to have held onto the arm of Foderingham in the build-up to the goal. After a short delay, the referee headed to his monitor after guidance from VAR, and it won't count! Still 0-0.
Bailey finds the run of Watkins who cuts inside and waits for a team-mate. He plays the ball into the path of Diaby who looks to dance through the opposition defenders, but it deflects behind for a corner. McGinn is there to take and he delivers towards the back post, but Konsa can't quite get there.
Bogle goes into the book for a strong challenge on Ramsey near the halfway line.
Villa have an opportunity from a free-kick as Luiz sends a cross into the box. It's headed away and the Blades clear the danger. Emery's side are trying everything to find a goal in the second half, but Wilder's men are defending superbly and frustrating the Midlands outfit.
Villa are now appealing for a penalty once again. The ball bounces in the box and Baldock swings his arm towards it. VAR is now checking whether a penalty should be awarded! Check complete... NOT GIVEN! The referee waves play on. It appeared to come off his shoulder.
Emery makes a change in attack, with Diaby coming off, to be replaced by Colombian striker Duran.
Villa make an alteration at left-back. Moreno comes on in a straight swap for Digne.
Wilder looks to mix things up in attack, with McAtee coming off the bench. Slimane is the player to make way.
Duran gives the ball away and Lowe carries it into the Villa half. It's switched out wide to Hamer who stays patient, waiting for his team-mates to arrive. He lays it into the path of Norwood on the edge of the box and he strikes it first time towards the top corner, but Martinez dives across his goal and holds. That was Sheffield United's first shot of the game.
So close! The ball comes to Lowe on the left-hand side after some good work from McAtee. He fires a delivery low and hard into the penalty area, and Konsa swings a leg at it. It looks as though it's flying towards the top corner, but it whistles past the post and out for a corner. The Villa fans breathe a sigh of relief!
Emery makes another change in attack. Zaniolo enters the fray, with Bailey taking his place on the bench.
Sheffield United have started to grow into the game in the second half and are beginning to show a little more attacking intent, causing Villa some problems. Emery will be incredibly disappointed with the lack of chances his team have created. The Villans have managed just two shots since the break.
VAR is now called into action once again. The are checking whether Duran should be sent off after an altercation with Robinson. After a short delay, the referee waves play on.
GOOOOOAAAAALLLL!! 1-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED!! A clever pass finds Hamer who has burst forward from midfield into the box. He turns inside the penalty area, sending McGinn to the ground, before firing a cross into the danger zone. It falls to Archer, who takes aim and smashes it home! He's scored against his former club! Wilder's side have a shock lead!
Hamer came off the bench to produce a superb assist. After an excellent turn into the penalty area, his delivery to Archer's feet was inch-perfect.
Villa are heavily pushing for an equaliser after the goal from United has sparked them into life. A delivery is deep towards the back post from Zaniolo and Moreno finds himself unmarked before powering a header towards goal, but Foderingham makes a superb stop to deny him.
Wilder brings on some fresh legs in attack, with the goalscorer Archer replaced by McBurnie.
The fourth official indicated just a few moments ago that there would be a minimum of nine minutes of added time at the end of the game. There has been a host of VAR checks, so it's certainly not surprising.
Villa are struggling to find a breakthrough in the final few minutes of the game. Emery's side are passing it back and forth inside the Sheffield United half, but the lack of creativity will be a major concern for the Midlands outfit. To their credit, Wilder's men have defended superbly.
Zaniolo goes into the book for dissent after the referee opted against awarding him a free-kick.
GOOOAAAALLLL!! 1-1 ASTON VILLA EQUALISE LATE ON! Ramsey carries the ball through the middle and shifts it out wide to Luiz. The Brazilian gets it out of his feet and delivers into the penalty area, and Zaniolo rises above Foderingham who has come off his line, powering a header into the back of the net! Emery’s side finally turn their dominance into a goal!
Luiz's delivery tempted Foderingham to come off his line while also landing perfectly on the head of Zaniolo.
Trusty receives a yellow for an altercation in the back of the net after the goal was scored.
The Blades look to counter-attack, and Cash makes a tactical foul to prevent them going through on goal.
FULL-TIME: ASTON VILLA 1-1 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Aston Villa and Sheffield United share the spoils with the game ending 1-1. The first half produced little action with the Midlands outfit dominating the possession but struggling to break the away team down. There were minimal talking points in the opening 45 minutes, but the game sparked into life after the break. Emery thought his side had opened the scoring after Bailey fired in Watkins' cross, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR check. The Villans kept pushing, but it was the Blades who broke the deadlock, with Archer pouncing in the box to score against his former club. It looked as though Wilder's men had won it late on, but a Zaniolo header deep into stoppage time levelled the scoring. Villa will travel to Manchester United on Boxing Day as they look to go top of the Premier League table. Up next for Sheffield United, they will host fellow strugglers Luton Town at Bramall Lane. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Wolverhampton Wanderers produced a rampant display spearheaded by a Hwang Hee-chan brace as they secured an emphatic 4-1 victory against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. 
The South Korean scored twice in the first half, before going off injured, and goals from Mario Lemina and Jean-Ricner Bellegarde gave Wolves their biggest away win in the Premier League.
Yoane Wissa scored the hosts’ solitary goal as they slumped to a fourth straight defeat.
How the match unfolded
Thomas Frank made three changes from Brentford’s defeat against Aston Villa 10 days ago, with Nathan Collins replacing Mathias Jorgensen at the back, Yehor Yarmoliuk coming in for the suspended Ben Mee and Neal Maupay returning, with Mikkel Damsgaard dropping to the bench.
Wolves made one change from Sunday’s 2-1 win against Chelsea, with Santiago Bueno coming in for Craig Dawson. Gary O’Neil’s side were also boosted by the return of Pedro Neto, who was among the substitutes.
Despite a bright start from Brentford, it was Wolves who struck first as Lemina met a deep Pablo Sarabia cross to power in a header at the back post in the 13th minute.
The visitors’ one-goal advantage quickly became two 12 seconds from kick-off when Hwang beat Mark Flekken to an underhit backpass from ex-Wolves player Collins to roll the ball into an empty net.  
In an incredible opening to the match Brentford responded instantly as a clever flick from Maupay found Wissa, who stabbed a first-time shot past Jose Sa for his first league goal since October. 
The Bees came close to grabbing an equaliser just moments later when Keane Lewis-Potter whipped in a superb cross to the back post, but Vitaly Janelt’s header from close range was straight into the arms of Sa.
Just as the match was starting to settle, Wolves found a third. The visitors capitalised on a disorganised Brentford defence and picked out Hwang, who flicked the ball over Ethan Pinnock before firing a low shot past Flekken. This was to be Hwang’s final act of the evening, as he limped off soon after.
After the match, O'Neil allayed fears over Hwang's injury, saying the South Korean should be fit to play at the Asian Cup.
With seconds remaining of an enthralling first half, Maupay and Wissa combined again but the latter could only slice his shot wide.
Brentford started the second half with intent and came close to halvingthe deficit when Maupay slid a pass in behind the Wolves defence to Wissa, whose cutback found Lewis-Potter, but the young Englishman’s effort was tame.
The hosts had two chances to score again, with Lewis-Potter at the centre of both attacks, first clipping a cute cross to the back post that narrowly evaded Mads Roerslev, before darting to the byline and pulling a low cross back into a dangerous area.
Then Wolves came close, with Matheus Cunha latching on to a through-ball from Rayan Ait-Nouri, before sliding a low shot across goal that bounced off the far post.
Their fourth goal eventually came a few minutes later, Collins again ant fault as another loose pass put Wolves through on goal. It was Cunha again leading the charge, but this time the Brazilian laid off a pass to his left to allow Bellegarde to finish."

There were minimal talking points in the opening 45 minutes, but the game sparked into life after the break. Emery thought his side had opened the scoring after Bailey fired in Watkins' cross, but the goal was disallowed after a VAR check. The Villans kept pushing, but it was the Blades who broke the deadlock, with Archer pouncing in the box to score against his former club. It looked as though Wilder's men had won it late on, but a Zaniolo header deep into stoppage time levelled the scoring. Villa will travel to Team_14 on Boxing Day as they look to go top of the Premier League table. Up next for Team_17, they will host fellow strugglers Team_12 at Bramall Lane.

93517	Nott'm Forest	Man Utd	2023-12-30	The City Ground, Nottingham	29529.0	Tim Robinson		"Nuno Espirito Santo guided Nottingham Forest to a second win in a row, claiming a first home Premier League win over Manchester United, winning 2-1 to climb to 15th in the table thanks to Morgan Gibbs-White brilliant curling shot.
Man Utd’s hopes that their incredible comeback win over Aston Villa a week ago would mark a change in their fortunes were hit by a ninth league defeat of the season that leave them nine points off the top four.
How the match unfolded
Nuno made two changes from the side who won 3-1 at Newcastle United, with Ryan Yates and Nicolas Dominguez returning for Callum Hudson-Odoi and Ibrahim Sangare.
Erik ten Hag was forced into one change, with Antony coming in for the ill Rasmus Hojlund, meaning Marcus Rashford played down the middle.
It was a spirited start by Forest with Chris Wood, whose confidence was high after his Boxing Day hat-trick on Tyneside, having an early sight at goal but firing narrowly over.
Forest almost opened the scoring soon after when Raphael Varane miscued his clearance and watched the ball bounce across the face of the United goal and just wide. 
The hosts continued to search for the opener, former United winger Anthony Elanga cutting inside and laying a ball into Yates whose first-time shot flew over.
In a first half of few chances, United had just one shot on target, a deflected effort from Aaron Wan-Bissaka that Matt Turner saved easily in the 33rd minute.
Despite Forest having the brighter opening to the second half, United came closest to breaking the deadlock when Diogo Dalot struck a post with a well-hit shot from distance.
That sparked the match into life, with Morgan Gibbs-White earning a yellow card for a set of rash challenges, before Varane was also booked for tripping Elanga. 
In the 64th minute Forest got a deserved breakthrough. A patient passing move found Gonzalo Montiel on the right, who turned neatly before crossing for Dominguez to score with a first-time shot.
United came close to an immediate reply, Turner blocking an effort behind for a corner before then skewing a clearance and scrambling to amend his error.
Turner erred again but was punished this time as his poor pass out was intercepted by Garnacho, who squared to Rashford to whip a low finish into the bottom corner.
But with less than 10 minutes of normal time remaining Turner was able to redeem himself. From his save of Christian Eriksen, Forest countered. Elanga played in Gibbs-White, who wrapped a first-time shot beyond Andre Onana to restore their lead.
Deep into the 10 additional minutes of stoppage time Man Utd almost equalised, Eriksen spraying a corner out to Bruno Fernandes on the edge of the box but the captain’s sweetly struck effort deflected off Murillo before Turner tipped the ball over.
A first Forest win over Man Utd since November 1994 moves them up into 15th on 20 points, five above the bottom three. Man Utd remain seventh, nine points off the top four."			['']	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	Normal
93542	Bournemouth	Nott'm Forest	2024-02-04	Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth	11200.0	Rebecca Welch	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Nottingham Forest and Arsenal at The City Ground!
Forest were on a run of seven without a win (D1 L6) before Nuno Espirito Santo took over, with the Portuguese since overseeing just one loss in his six games at the helm (W3 D2), though that did come in their last Premier League outing when they were beaten 3-2 by Brentford. After seeing a flurry of goals in the first five games under Nuno, Forest played out a 0-0 draw away at Bristol City in their last match in the FA Cup, forcing them to another replay.
It was a 1-0 defeat in this exact fixture last season that ended Arsenal's title hopes, and the Gunners will be looking to avoid a similar scoreline here as they look to close the gap to Liverpool at the top of the table. They had a slight wobble before their mid-season break, winning just one of their seven games in all competitions (D3 L3), but came back revitalised with a thumping 5-0 win over Crystal Palace last time out. However, they're winless in their last three Premier League away games (D1 L2) and haven't won any of their last three trips to The City Ground in all competitions.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Matt Turner; Gonzalo Montiel, Andrew Omabamidele, Murillo, Harry Toffolo; Orel Mangala, Danilo; Nicolas Dominguez, Morgan Gibbs-White, Neco Williams; Chris Wood.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUBS: Odisseas Vlachodimos, Felipe, Ryan Yates, Joe Worrall, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Taiwo Awoniyi, Anthony Elanga, Wayne Hennessey, Brandon Aguilera.
ARSENAL STARTING XI (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Emile Smith Rowe; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.
ARSENAL SUBS: Reiss Nelson, Eddie Nketiah, Kai Havertz, Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jakub Kiwior, Jorginho, Leandro Trossard, Reuell Walters.
Nuno makes three changes from the side that drew with Bristol on Friday, as Toffolo, Gibbs-White and Williams are all brought in. Mangala retains his place, despite reports linking him with a possible move to Lyon today. Yates and Hudson-Odoi drop to the bench, where they are boosted by the returns of Felipe, Elanga and Awoniyi from injury. Nuno Tavares is ineligible to face his parent club.
Mikel Arteta makes just two changes to the side that beat Palace last time out. Smith Rowe and Martinelli, who scored twice after coming off the bench in that game, both come in. Gabriel and Rice are also fit to start after passing late fitness checks following respective ankle and thigh problems. Havertz and Trossard start on the bench.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Odegaard gets the game under way for Arsenal!
Forest crowd bodies down their left side, forcing Arsenal to switch it out to the opposite flank. Jesus plays a one-two with Martinelli to try and open up space on the edge of the box, but he can't get a sight of goal.
Jesus has started the game out on the left for the Gunners and he floats a cross into the box. It's just too high for Smith Rowe to get his head on, and Turner plucks it out of the air.
Forest are starting to press higher upfield now, and they're forcing Arsenal deeper into their own half. Gabriel just squeezes his pass past a stretching Williams, but Martinelli doesn't get too far with Dominguez tight to him.
Arsenal have won five of their last six Premier League games against Forest (L1), and are looking to do the double over them in the competition for just the second time (also in 1998-99).
Saka darts in behind down the right, but there's barely any space in the Forest penalty area. He tries to pull it back to the byline, but there are three red shirts between him and his closest team-mate.
Forest are struggling to get a foothold in the game so far, with Arsenal quickly winning it back whenever possession is turned over. The hosts are defending in numbers though, making things difficult for the Gunners.
BLOCK! Odegaard sees a low shot blocked from the right, and Arsenal quickly switch it out to the opposite flank, with Martinelli sliding it through for Smith Rowe. He squares it into the middle for Jesus, but his first-time shot deflects over off Omobamidele.
The offside flag goes up to end an Arsenal attack, and now there's a break in play, Turner goes down holding his right hand. He needs treatment, but he's quickly back on his feet to continue.
Forest's first push into the final third is quickly smothered, and Arsenal break quickly on the counter. Zinchenko tries to slide in Jesus on the left of the box, but the offside flag is up once more.
Raya goes long with a free-kick, and White gets in front of Toffolo down the right. A heavy touch at the wrong moment gets away from him though, and he runs it out of play before he can put a cross in.
Arsenal have had 71 per cent possession so far in this game, and they don't look like letting up the pressure any time soon. Martinelli drops a shoulder to lose Montiel down the right, but there are no Arsenal players in the box to get on the end of his cross.
Jesus drops deep in his own half to cut out a Forest attack before setting Martinelli on the break. He drives down the left and sees a cross blocked by Williams, who goes to ground. He's holding his wrist, but he gets back up without needing treatment.
Williams is penalised for a handball in midfield and Arsenal win a free-kick. After some debate, it's Odegaard that whips it into the box, but Turner rushes off his line to collect it.
Martinelli is getting a lot of joy down the left, and after Rice stops Gibbs-White's cross, he sets the Brazilian on his way. He fizzes a low cross into the box this time, but Murillo slides in to stop it from reaching Saka.
Saka gets a yard on Toffolo and lays it off to Odegaard, who touches it straight to Jesus. Instead of turning to have a shot, he tries to return it to the Arsenal captain, but it's one pass too many, and Forest clear their lines.
CHANCE! It's better from Arsenal here as Jesus slips away from Williams to burst along the edge of the box before touching it into Smith Rowe's feet. He spins to get a shot away, but he scoops it just wide of the near post.
Forest have barely managed a touch of the ball in the last five minutes as Arsenal continue to up the pressure. Jesus is in the middle of every attack as he lifts it over the top towards Martinelli, but Omabamidele stretches to nod it out of his path.
The Forest fans aren't happy with the referee at the moment, as they feel they should've had a free-kick. Dominguez looks to play a one-two with Williams, but he's blocked off from getting to the return pass. The referee waves him back to his feet.
BLOCK! There's a collision between Omabamidele and Montiel that sees the latter stay down in the box, but the referee doesn't stop play as it isn't a head injury. Martinelli carries on, curling a shot on goal, but it's blocked by Murillo.
Now that the danger has gone for Forest, Montiel goes down once more. He was caught on his shoulder by Omabamidele's studs and needs treatment. He's okay to carry on.
Again, Arsenal overwork it in the final third, and another chance goes begging. It's more good work by Jesus down the left as he fizzes it into the box, but Odegaard chooses to knock it onto Rice. There isn't enough on it though, and Danilo pokes it away.
Jesus picks up the first yellow card of the game. He's complaining about a decision not going his way and gets booked for dissent.
CHANCE! Danilo wins it back in midfield and the space just opens up in front of him to drive into. He takes it to the edge of the D before taking aim, but his shot sails just over Raya's crossbar.
SO CLOSE! Zinchenko's sliced cross isn't dealt with by Forest, and Smith Rowe keeps the move alive for Arsenal. His touch is heavy, but it ends up being a good pass to Saka, whose first-time shot trickles just wide of the near post after taking a deflection off Murillo.
Into the first of three added minutes, and Arsenal are trying to get a goal just before the break. They're still finding a lot of space down their left, with Zinchenko clipping it in this time, but Jesus' header loops high over the bar.
GOOD SAVE! In the final action of the first half, Saka checks back to lose Montiel before curling a deep cross into the far post. Jesus gets above Omabamidele to head it towards the top corner, but Turner stretches to tip it over.
HALF-TIME: NOTTINGHAM FOREST 0-0 ARSENAL.
Despite Arsenal's dominance over Forest in the first half, it's goalless at the break. The Gunners had 81 per cent possession but struggled to break down a compact Forest side in front of them. Their best chance came on the stroke of half-time as Jesus' header had to be scrambled over by Turner, with Smith Rowe also sending an attempt over on the half-hour mark. Forest barely got out of their own half, but Danilo had a good chance, only to send it over the bar when one-on-one with Raya.
As soon as the half-time whistle blew, Arteta set off on a jog down the tunnel, clearly eager to get his team inside. Everything has worked for them until they got it into the final third, and they need to come up with a plan on how to open up their opponents. Forest have defended as a unit, which Nuno will have been pleased to see. They'll likely keep biding their time, looking for the golden chance that could snatch something from this game.
There's a change at the break for Forest, and it's a straight swap up front. Wood struggled to get into the game, and he's replaced by Awoniyi.
Forest get us back under way for the second half!
Arsenal have picked up where they left off in the first half, with Saka linking up well with Jesus down the right. The Brazilian fizzes a low cross towards Smith Rowe, but Murillo hooks it away.
Zinchenko chips it forward for Martinelli, and it looks like the chance is gone when he trips, but he does well to still get a cross away. He can't pick out a team-mate either though, and Forest clear their lines once more.
Gibbs-White tries to pick out Awoniyi with an early pass, but Gabriel blocks it, only to gift possession back to the midfielder. He switches it out to Williams on the right instead, but Saliba gets in the way of that cross. That's much better by Forest!
SAVE! Awoniyi is wrestled down by Saliba to win a free-kick, and Gibbs-White curls a good delivery into the box. Williams rises highest to nod it towards goal, but it's straight down the middle at Raya.
GREAT SAVE! The game has opened up in the last couple of minutes, and Arsenal surge forward on the counter. It's not the cleanest strike by Saka as it bobbles in front of him and takes a slight nick off Montiel, but Turner still needs to get a strong arm behind it.
Jesus has his hands up at the far post, asking for Martinelli to pick him out as he's completely unmarked. His fellow Brazilian tries to do just that, but Murillo thumps it away for a corner in front of Turner, who had it covered.
OFF THE POST! It's great play from Arsenal, as Saka rolls it back to Odegaard, who dummies a shot before laying it off to Jesus on the right of the box. He's one-on-one with Turner and rifles a powerful shot past him, but it ricochets off the near post.
Forest have only won one of their last six Premier League games when drawing 0-0 at half-time (D3 L2), although that win did come in their most recent such match (2-1 v Manchester United in December).
Danilo spins away from two Arsenal defenders with clever turns, hooking the ball over his shoulder each time. There are half-hearted shouts from the stands for a penalty after he goes down under pressure from Gabriel in the box, but nothing's given.
Omabamidele darts in front of Smith Rowe to cut out Martinelli's cross, only to gift it straight back to the winger. He tries to pick out Jesus with his second attempt, but Danilo intercepts that one.
Forest are making another change here, and it's another adjustment to their frontline. Dominguez goes off, with Hudson-Odoi brought on in his place.
JESUS SCORES! Arsenal finally break the deadlock! After all of their hard work, Forest are opened up by a long throw-in from Zinchenko to Jesus, who has time to turn before driving into the box. The angle is tight, and he has no right to score from there, but his low shot goes through Turner's legs and rolls over the line. 1-0 Arsenal!
Zinchenko is assessing his options when the space just opens up for him to throw it straight to Jesus, though the forward still has a lot of work to do.
Nuno gives a shake of his head on the touchline as Forest get the game back under way. Williams pushes forward down the right, but can't get away from Zinchenko to pick out a cross.
Saliba cuts out Williams' cross, and the Gunners mount another dangerous counter. Saka has acres of space down the right and cuts inside to curl a shot on goal. It's blocked by Mangala, and Arsenal win their eighth corner of the game.
Arsenal's first change of the game sees Smith Rowe taken off for Havertz.
And there's another roll of the dice for Forest too, as Mangala makes way for Yates.
SAKA SCORES! It's a really poor attempt to get Forest upfield by Montiel as he gifts it straight to Odegaard on the edge of the centre circle. He wastes no time sweeping it out to Jesus on the left, and he gets his head up to spot Saka in space on the edge of the box. He hits a low shot across goal, and though Turner gets fingertips to it, he can't stop it from hitting the back of the net. 2-0 Arsenal!
Jesus has had a really bright game for Arsenal, and now he has an assist to go with his earlier goal.
Jesus has switched out to the right now, and he whips a pacy cross into Havertz on the far side. He can't get it under control for a shot but manages to poke it to Saka. Murillo desperately swings out a leg to clear it just in time.
That second Arsenal goal just seems to have knocked Forest's confidence slightly, and they're not pressing as high as before. The visitors aren't in a hurry to push forward, content to hold onto the ball in their own half.
Forest's final change of the game sees Elanga make his return from a thigh injury as he comes on for Williams.
Arsenal are making a double change as well. Martinelli goes off for Trossard.
And Jesus goes off to a warm reception from the away fans as he's replaced by Nketiah.
Jesus has now scored against 29 of the 31 sides he has played against in the Premier League (94 per cent), failing to do so only against Cardiff City (one app) and Manchester City (two apps).
WIDE! Arsenal break quickly on the counter once more, and Odegaard slides it into Trossard's path on the edge of the box. He puts his laces through the shot, but it swerves away from goal and wide of the post.
Nketiah is slightly off balance, but he still manages to volley a cross into the box, looking for Trossard on the penalty spot. Omabamidele is alert to send it out for another Arsenal corner, which comes to nothing.
Forest are still trying to play out from the back, but they can't find a way through Arsenal. Awoniyi plays a blind pass out to the right, not realising that none of his team-mates are there, and the Gunners are quickly back in possession.
It's a risky backpass from Danilo to Turner, and he doesn't get enough on it. Saka gambles by chasing it down, but he catches Toffolo as the defender tries to hook it away.
AWONIYI PULLS ONE BACK! Danilo goes for a more direct route this time, making a big switch to Montiel on the right, and he picks out a good cross into the middle. Awoniyi has two Arsenal defenders around him, but an awkward bounce favours him and wrongfoots Saliba. The forward reacts quickest to latch onto it and pokes it under Raya. VAR checks for an offside against Montiel, but he was onside. 2-1!
Montiel times his run perfectly to get in behind Zinchenko before picking out a good cross that causes confusion in the Arsenal penalty area.
Into the first of five added minutes here, and the Forest fans now believe they can snatch something late on. They're urging their team upfield and another loud cheer goes up as Elanga wins a corner.
Arteta is making a double change before Forest can take their corner because he wants to get two more defensive players on. Jorginho replaces Odegaard.
And Kiwior comes on in place of Zinchenko.
BLOCK! Raya's punched clearance isn't overly convincing, and it loops to Gibbs-White, who puts his laces through the half-volley. Kiwior is at full stretch to block it and it loops up for Awoniyi, but his effort is straight at the goalkeeper.
Murillo jumps to clear a long ball over the top, but as he does, Nketiah crashes head-first into his hip. The defender can't believe that a free-kick has gone against him, but it's giving Arsenal a chance to run the clock down.
Forest have one last chance to get the ball into the box, and Toffolo goes for a long throw-in. It's headed straight back to him by Rice, but his follow-up cross skims the top of Elanga's head.
FULL-TIME: NOTTINGHAM FOREST 1-2 ARSENAL.
Arsenal hold on to get a 2-1 win over Forest and close the gap to league leaders Liverpool. The Gunners dominated the first half but struggled in the final third to break down a compact Forest defence, though Jesus forced Turner into a good save right on the stroke of half-time. Things opened up after the break, and Jesus rifled a shot against the post before finally breaking the deadlock with a clever finish from a very tight angle. Shortly after, Arsenal got their second following a quick counter as Saka drilled his low shot across goal into the bottom corner. In the 89th minute, Awoniyi gave the hosts some hope, poking it past Raya to half the deficit, but they couldn't find another to get something from the game. It's three points that lift Arsenal into second place, now just two points behind Liverpool, who don't play until tomorrow, and it's the Reds that they face at the weekend. As for Forest, they stay in 16th, but the gap to the relegation zone is significantly smaller now due to results elsewhere. They travel to Bournemouth on Sunday. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Callum Hudson-Odoi earned Nottingham Forest a point as they drew 1-1 at AFC Bournemouth to move two points clear of the bottom three.
Justin Kluivert opened the scoring for the Cherries, but Hudson-Odoi levelled with a sweetly-struck shot on the stroke of half-time.
Bournemouth substitute Philip Billing was sent off for a dangerous challenge on Hudson-Odoi with six minutes remaining, but Andoni Iraola’s side held on for a second consecutive 1-1 draw.
How the match unfolded
Iraola made two changes from the side that drew at West Ham United, with Luis Sinisterra and Kluivert coming in for Marcus Tavernier and Alex Scott.
As for Forest, new signing Matz Sels started in goal, while fellow January arrivals Gio Reyna and Rodrigo Ribeiro were named among the substitutes. Taiwo Awoniyi returned in attack after scoring off the bench in the 2-1 defeat to Arsenal as one of six changes.
It only took Bournemouth five minutes to open the scoring, with Sinisterra’s corner taking a touch off Forest’s Neco Williams before falling to Kluivert, who finished at the far post.
Forest responded well to the early setback, with Awoniyi forcing two saves from Neto before Ryan Yates missed a glorious chance to equalise, poking tamely at the Bournemouth 'keeper.
But the visitors did score a deserved equaliser on 45 minutes through Hudson-Odoi.
Bournemouth were unable to clear a free-kick, and after picking up the ball just outside the penalty area, Hudson-Odoi drove forward before whipping a superb shot into the bottom-right corner for his first Premier League goal since September.
Both sides struggled to create clear-cut openings in the second half, with Awoniyi hesitating when presented with a sight of goal.
Billing was shown a red card late on, but Forest were unable to take advantage, with Morgan Gibbs-White scuffing a shot straight at Neto, as both sides had to settle for a point.
Nuno Espirito Santo’s team stay 16th on 21 points, six fewer than Bournemouth, who remain 12th.

Jesus plays a one-two with Martinelli to try and open up space on the edge of the box, but he can't get a sight of goal.\nJesus has started the game out on the left for the Gunners and he floats a cross into the box. It's just too high for Smith Rowe to get his head on, and Turner plucks it out of the air.\nForest are starting to press higher upfield now, and they're forcing Team_1 deeper into their own half. Gabriel just squeezes his pass past a stretching Williams, but Martinelli doesn't get too far with Dominguez tight to him.\nTeam_1 have won five of their last six Premier League games against Forest (L1), and are looking to do the double over them in the competition for just the second time (also in 1998-99).\nSaka darts in behind down the right, but there's barely any space in the Forest penalty area. He tries to pull it back to the byline, but there are three red shirts between him and his closest team-mate.\nForest are struggling to get a foothold in the game so far, with Team_1 quickly winning it back whenever possession is turned over. The hosts are defending in numbers though, making things difficult for the Gunners.\nBLOCK! Odegaard sees a low shot blocked from the right, and Team_1 quickly switch it out to the opposite flank, with Martinelli sliding it through for Smith Rowe. He squares it into the middle for Jesus, but his first-time shot deflects over off Omobamidele.\nThe offside flag goes up to end an Team_1 attack, and now there's a break in play, Turner goes down holding his right hand. He needs treatment, but he's quickly back on his feet to continue.\nForest's first push into the final third is quickly smothered, and Team_1 break quickly on the counter. Zinchenko tries to slide in Jesus on the left of the box, but the offside flag is up once more.\nRaya goes long with a free-kick, and White gets in front of Toffolo down the right. A heavy touch at the wrong moment gets away from him though, and he runs it out of play before he can put a cross in.\nTeam_1 have had 71 per cent possession so far in this game, and they don't look like letting up the pressure any time soon. Martinelli drops a shoulder to lose Montiel down the right, but there are no Team_1 players in the box to get on the end of his cross.\nJesus drops deep in his own half to cut out a Forest attack before setting Martinelli on the break. He drives down the left and sees a cross blocked by Williams, who goes to ground. He's holding his wrist, but he gets back up without needing treatment.\nWilliams is penalised for a handball in midfield and Team_1 win a free-kick. After some debate, it's Odegaard that whips it into the box, but Turner rushes off his line to collect it.\nMartinelli is getting a lot of joy down the left, and after Rice stops Gibbs-White's cross, he sets the Brazilian on his way. He fizzes a low cross into the box this time, but Murillo slides in to stop it from reaching Saka.\nSaka gets a yard on Toffolo and lays it off to Odegaard, who touches it straight to Jesus. Instead of turning to have a shot, he tries to return it to the Team_1 captain, but it's one pass too many, and Forest clear their lines.\nCHANCE! It's better from Team_1 here as Jesus slips away from Williams to burst along the edge of the box before touching it into Smith Rowe's feet. He spins to get a shot away, but he scoops it just wide of the near post.\nForest have barely managed a touch of the ball in the last five minutes as Team_1 continue to up the pressure. Jesus is in the middle of every attack as he lifts it over the top towards Martinelli, but Omabamidele stretches to nod it out of his path.\nThe Forest fans aren't happy with the referee at the moment, as they feel they should've had a free-kick. Dominguez looks to play a one-two with Williams, but he's blocked off from getting to the return pass. The referee waves him back to his feet.\nBLOCK! There's a collision between Omabamidele and Montiel that sees the latter stay down in the box, but the referee doesn't stop play as it isn't a head injury. Martinelli carries on, curling a shot on goal, but it's blocked by Murillo.\nNow that the danger has gone for Forest, Montiel goes down once more. He was caught on his shoulder by Omabamidele's studs and needs treatment. He's okay to carry on.\nAgain, Team_1 overwork it in the final third, and another chance goes begging. It's more good work by Jesus down the left as he fizzes it into the box, but Odegaard chooses to knock it onto Rice. There isn't enough on it though, and Danilo pokes it away.\nJesus picks up the first yellow card of the game. He's complaining about a decision not going his way and gets booked for dissent.\nCHANCE! Danilo wins it back in midfield and the space just opens up in front of him to drive into. He takes it to the edge of the D before taking aim, but his shot sails just over Raya's crossbar.\nSO CLOSE! Zinchenko's sliced cross isn't dealt with by Forest, and Smith Rowe keeps the move alive for Team_1. His touch is heavy, but it ends up being a good pass to Saka, whose first-time shot trickles just wide of the near post after taking a deflection off Murillo.\nInto the first of three added minutes, and Team_1 are trying to get a goal just before the break. They're still finding a lot of space down their left, with Zinchenko clipping it in this time, but Jesus' header loops high over the bar.\nGOOD SAVE! In the final action of the first half, Saka checks back to lose Montiel before curling a deep cross into the far post. Jesus gets above Omabamidele to head it towards the top corner, but Turner stretches to tip it over.\nHALF-TIME: Team_16 0-0 Team_1.\nDespite Team_1 dominance over Forest in the first half, it's goalless at the break. The Gunners had 81 per cent possession but struggled to break down a compact Forest side in front of them. Their best chance came on the stroke of half-time as Jesus' header had to be scrambled over by Turner, with Smith Rowe also sending an attempt over on the half-hour mark. Forest barely got out of their own half, but Danilo had a good chance, only to send it over the bar when one-on-one with Raya.\nAs soon as the half-time whistle blew, Arteta set off on a jog down the tunnel, clearly eager to get his team inside. Everything has worked for them until they got it into the final third, and they need to come up with a plan on how to open up their opponents. Forest have defended as a unit, which Nuno will have been pleased to see. They'll likely keep biding their time, looking for the golden chance that could snatch something from this game.\nThere's a change at the break for Forest, and it's a straight swap up front. Wood struggled to get into the game, and he's replaced by Awoniyi.\nForest get us back under way for the second half!\nTeam_1 have picked up where they left off in the first half, with Saka linking up well with Jesus down the right. The Brazilian fizzes a low cross towards Smith Rowe, but Murillo hooks it away.\nZinchenko chips it forward for Martinelli, and it looks like the chance is gone when he trips, but he does well to still get a cross away. He can't pick out a team-mate either though, and Forest clear their lines once more.\nGibbs-White tries to pick out Awoniyi with an early pass, but Gabriel blocks it, only to gift possession back to the midfielder. He switches it out to Williams on the right instead, but Saliba gets in the way of that cross. That's much better by Forest!\nSAVE! Awoniyi is wrestled down by Saliba to win a free-kick, and Gibbs-White curls a good delivery into the box. Williams rises highest to nod it towards goal, but it's straight down the middle at Raya.\nGREAT SAVE! The game has opened up in the last couple of minutes, and Team_1 surge forward on the counter. It's not the cleanest strike by Saka as it bobbles in front of him and takes a slight nick off Montiel, but Turner still needs to get a strong arm behind it.\nJesus has his hands up at the far post, asking for Martinelli to pick him out as he's completely unmarked. His fellow Brazilian tries to do just that, but Murillo thumps it away for a corner in front of Turner, who had it covered.\nOFF THE POST! It's great play from Team_1, as Saka rolls it back to Odegaard, who dummies a shot before laying it off to Jesus on the right of the box. He's one-on-one with Turner and rifles a powerful shot past him, but it ricochets off the near post.\nForest have only won one of their last six Premier League games when drawing 0-0 at half-time (D3 L2), although that win did come in their most recent such match (2-1 v Team_14 in December).\nDanilo spins away from two Team_1 defenders with clever turns, hooking the ball over his shoulder each time. There are half-hearted shouts from the stands for a penalty after he goes down under pressure from Gabriel in the box, but nothing's given.\nOmabamidele darts in front of Smith Rowe to cut out Martinelli's cross, only to gift it straight back to the winger. He tries to pick out Jesus with his second attempt, but Danilo intercepts that one.\nForest are making another change here, and it's another adjustment to their frontline. Dominguez goes off, with Hudson-Odoi brought on in his place.\nJESUS SCORES! Team_1 finally break the deadlock! After all of their hard work, Forest are opened up by a long throw-in from Zinchenko to Jesus, who has time to turn before driving into the box. The angle is tight, and he has no right to score from there, but his low shot goes through Turner's legs and rolls over the line. 1-0 Team_1!\nZinchenko is assessing his options when the space just opens up for him to throw it straight to Jesus, though the forward still has a lot of work to do.\nNuno gives a shake of his head on the touchline as Forest get the game back under way. Williams pushes forward down the right, but can't get away from Zinchenko to pick out a cross.\nSaliba cuts out Williams' cross, and the Gunners mount another dangerous counter. Saka has acres of space down the right and cuts inside to curl a shot on goal. It's blocked by Mangala, and Team_1 win their eighth corner of the game.\nTeam_1 first change of the game sees Smith Rowe taken off for Havertz.\nAnd there's another roll of the dice for Forest too, as Mangala makes way for Yates.\nSAKA SCORES! It's a really poor attempt to get Forest upfield by Montiel as he gifts it straight to Odegaard on the edge of the centre circle. He wastes no time sweeping it out to Jesus on the left, and he gets his head up to spot Saka in space on the edge of the box. He hits a low shot across goal, and though Turner gets fingertips to it, he can't stop it from hitting the back of the net. 2-0 Team_1!\nJesus has had a really bright game for Team_1, and now he has an assist to go with his earlier goal.\nJesus has switched out to the right now, and he whips a pacy cross into Havertz on the far side. He can't get it under control for a shot but manages to poke it to Saka. Murillo desperately swings out a leg to clear it just in time.\nThat second Team_1 goal just seems to have knocked Forest's confidence slightly, and they're not pressing as high as before. The visitors aren't in a hurry to push forward, content to hold onto the ball in their own half.\nForest's final change of the game sees Elanga make his return from a thigh injury as he comes on for Williams.\nTeam_1 are making a double change as well. Martinelli goes off for Trossard.\nAnd Jesus goes off to a warm reception from the away fans as he's replaced by Nketiah.\nJesus has now scored against 29 of the 31 sides he has played against in the Premier League (94 per cent), failing to do so only against Cardiff City (one app) and Team_13 (two apps).\nWIDE! Team_1 break quickly on the counter once more, and Odegaard slides it into Trossard's path on the edge of the box. He puts his laces through the shot, but it swerves away from goal and wide of the post.\nNketiah is slightly off balance, but he still manages to volley a cross into the box, looking for Trossard on the penalty spot. Omabamidele is alert to send it out for another Team_1 corner, which comes to nothing.\nForest are still trying to play out from the back, but they can't find a way through Team_1. Awoniyi plays a blind pass out to the right, not realising that none of his team-mates are there, and the Gunners are quickly back in possession.\nIt's a risky backpass from Danilo to Turner, and he doesn't get enough on it. Saka gambles by chasing it down, but he catches Toffolo as the defender tries to hook it away.\nAWONIYI PULLS ONE BACK! Danilo goes for a more direct route this time, making a big switch to Montiel on the right, and he picks out a good cross into the middle. Awoniyi has two Team_1 defenders around him, but an awkward bounce favours him and wrongfoots Saliba. The forward reacts quickest to latch onto it and pokes it under Raya. VAR checks for an offside against Montiel, but he was onside. 2-1!\nMontiel times his run perfectly to get in behind Zinchenko before picking out a good cross that causes confusion in the Team_1 penalty area.\nInto the first of five added minutes here, and the Forest fans now believe they can snatch something late on. They're urging their team upfield and another loud cheer goes up as Elanga wins a corner.\nArteta is making a double change before Forest can take their corner because he wants to get two more defensive players on. Jorginho replaces Odegaard.\nAnd Kiwior comes on in place of Zinchenko.\nBLOCK! Raya's punched clearance isn't overly convincing, and it loops to Gibbs-White, who puts his laces through the half-volley. Kiwior is at full stretch to block it and it loops up for Awoniyi, but his effort is straight at the goalkeeper.\nMurillo jumps to clear a long ball over the top, but as he does, Nketiah crashes head-first into his hip. The defender can't believe that a free-kick has gone against him, but it's giving Team_1 a chance to run the clock down.\nForest have one last chance to get the ball into the box, and Toffolo goes for a long throw-in. It's headed straight back to him by Rice, but his follow-up cross skims the top of Elanga's head.\nFULL-TIME: Team_16 1-2 Team_1.\nTeam_1 hold on to get a 2-1 win over Forest and close the gap to league leaders Team_11. The Gunners dominated the first half but struggled in the final third to break down a compact Forest defence, though Jesus forced Turner into a good save right on the stroke of half-time. Things opened up after the break, and Jesus rifled a shot against the post before finally breaking the deadlock with a clever finish from a very tight angle. Shortly after, Team_1 got their second following a quick counter as Saka drilled his low shot across goal into the bottom corner. In the 89th minute, Awoniyi gave the hosts some hope, poking it past Raya to half the deficit, but they couldn't find another to get something from the game. It's three points that lift Team_1 into second place, now just two points behind Team_11, who don't play until tomorrow, and it's the Reds that they face at the weekend. As for Forest, they stay in 16th, but the gap to the relegation zone is significantly smaller now due to results elsewhere. They travel to Team_3 on Sunday. That's all for today, goodbye!""]"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93407	Newcastle	Crystal Palace	2023-10-21	St. James' Park, Newcastle	52189.0	Tim Robinson	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Everton and Luton Town at Goodison Park!
It's been a good week for Everton - they picked up their first Premier League win of the season last time out, beating Brentford 3-1 on Saturday before following it up with an EFL Cup third-round win over Aston Villa in midweek to progress to the next round. They're looking to keep building on this momentum and turn around their fortunes at home after failing to win and score in all three of their games at Goodison Park so far.
Luton, on the other hand, are still looking for their first win in the league this season, but did get their first point on the board in a 1-1 draw with 10-man Wolves last weekend. They've lost their other four games in the competition, and come into this game after being knocked out of the EFL Cup by League One side, Exeter City, in their midweek match.
EVERTON STARTING XI (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ashley Young, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; James Garner, Amadou Onana, Idrissa Gueye, Dwight McNeil; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
EVERTON SUBS: Lewis Dobbin, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Michael Keane, Ben Godfrey, Arnaut Danjuma, Jack Harrison, Joao Virginia, Nathan Patterson.
LUTON TOWN STARTING XI (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Reece Burke, Tom Lockyer, Amari'i Bell; Issa Kabore, Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, Marvelous Nakamba, Alfie Doughty; Jacob Brown, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: Ryan Giles, Cauley Woodrow, Luke Berry, Joseph Johnson, Teden Mengi, Tahith Chong, Elijah Adebayo, Mads Andersen, Tim Krul.
Sean Dyche makes four changes from the side that knocked Villa out of the EFL Cup on Wednesday. Young, Gueye, McNeil and Doucoure are all brought in, while Mykolenko has passed a late fitness test to retain his place. Keane, Patterson, Harrison and Danjuma drop to the bench.
After ringing in the changes for their midweek loss to Exeter, Rob Edwards goes back to the side that drew with Wolves in their last Premier League game, with one enforced alteration. Albert Sambi Lokonga picked up a hamstring injury in that match, so he's out. Mpanzu comes in to replace him.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Ogbene gets the game under way for Luton!
It's Everton trying to pile on some early pressure and it's knocked back to Tarkowski who sends it long over the top. Doucoure has made a good run through the middle, but Lockyer gets across to cut it out.
CLOSE! Doucoure's pass out to McNeil on the left is short, but a lazy touch by Kabore helps it into the winger's feet anyway. It bounces up in front of him and he strikes it on the volley, but it flashes wide of the far post.
SAVE! It's lovely work from Everton down the left, but Mykolenko's cross is put out from a throw-in. The left-back gets it straight back from Doucoure and this time picks out a good ball, but Calvert-Lewin's header is straight at Kaminski.
It's a good, darting run from Ogbene down the left, and he pulls it back to Nakamba when he spots him in space on the edge of the box. He leans back as he takes the shot though, and it's always rising over the bar.
Luton are winless in their six league games against Everton (D3 L3), with this the first such meeting between the sides since a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park in March 1992.
WIDE! Luton are wide open at the back and Doucoure switches play wonderfully out to Garner in acres of space down the right. He cuts onto his left foot and then tries to place it, but instead curls it wide of the far post.
CHANCE! It's more good play from Everton as Onana threads it through to Doucoure. He can't get a sight of goal so knocks it back for Gueye on the edge of the box, but he fires his first-time shot wide of the near post.
Onana finds another pocket of space in midfield and he floats a lovely pass out to Garner on the right. He plays a dangerous low ball across the six-yard box, but nobody's there for Everton.
WIDE! Everton miss another good chance! They knock it neatly down the left, and Mykolenko flicks it to Onana. He tries to whip a shot towards the far bottom corner, but just can't get it on target.
Down the other end, Morris holds the ball up before teeing up Ogbene for another driving run down the left. He pulls it back to the penalty spot towards Brown, but Onana gets back in time to hook it away.
Luton are starting to grow into this game, and Bell plays a good reverse pass into Doughty on the left. He holds the ball up instead of putting it into the box, but does manage to win a corner.
OVER! The resulting corner is swung in by Doughty, and his out-swinging cross picks out Lockyer in the middle. He rises high to thump a header towards goal, but it flies over the bar.
Onana is screaming for the ball in midfield and Garner eventually picks him out. He tries to slide it into the box for Calvert-Lewin, but they're not on the same wavelength, so it's a comfortable take for Kaminski.
LOCKYER SCORES! Everton just haven't been able to cope with Luton on corners, and the visitors have punished them! Doughty swings another dangerous cross in and Morris thumps a header on goal. It hits the bottom of the crossbar and bounces in front of Young, who tries to clear it. He hits the ball straight against Lockyer, who throws himself in front of it, and it hits the back of the net. 1-0 Luton!
Everton are looking to regain some of their earlier dominance and it's hooked upfield to Calvert-Lewin again. This time, he fouls his man trying to nod it down, and Luton have a free-kick.
Mpanzu went down after being shrugged off the ball in midfield, and he's holding his side. He slowly gets back up to his feet, and he can carry on without treatment.
CHANCE! Everton's threat comes from their left again, and McNeil jinks past Morris before whipping a dangerous cross into Calvert-Lewin. He can't get enough contact on the ball though, and ends up glancing it wide.
Onana has nicked the ball off Morris, but Tarkowski bundles into the forward, giving away a needless free-kick, which Doughty is standing over.
MORRIS SCORES! The forward peels away from the line of Everton defenders on the edge of the box, and he's completely free at the far post. Doughty picks him out, and Morris meets the ball on the half-volley, sending it across goal and out of Pickford's reach. 2-0 Luton!
It's another delightful delivery from Doughty, who is causing Everton all sorts of problems with the set-pieces that he's taking.
The rain is coming down even heavier now, and the slick surface is causing a few problems. Morris nods it forward for Ogbene, and Young's pass almost plays in the winger, but he manages to get it back to Pickford.
Gueye finds himself in a pocket of space just outside the box and shapes to shoot before deciding against it. Instead, he touches it out to Mykolenko, but nobody is in the middle for the hosts to meet his cross.
OFF THE BAR! Everton work it well down their left once more, and McNeil floats a great cross towards the far post. Garner darts forward to meet it and thumps a header on goal. Kaminski is beaten, but it smacks off the crossbar.
Everton are still seeing a lot of the ball, but they're finding it difficult to break down Luton. Tarkowski lifts another long ball over the top that forces Calvert-Lewin wide, which means that nobody is in the box for the hosts again.
CALVERT-LEWIN PULLS ONE BACK! Pickford's long ball is only half-cleared by Luton and Garner swings a follow-up cross into the middle. Onana is onside as he pokes it on goal, but Kaminski denies him. The keeper then scrambles across to deny Doucoure from close range but he can't get to Calvert-Lewin's prod. VAR is having a long look, but it'll count!
VAR is checking two things on this goal. The first is whether or not there was a foul on Burke in the build-up, and that's cleared up pretty quickly. The second is whether or not Calvert-Lewin is offside. It's a tight call, and it's taking some time to figure out.
THE GOAL STANDS! Everton have their first home goal of the season! Burke was leaning slightly to the left, and it's his shoulder that was playing Calvert-Lewin onside. It's 2-1!
BLOCK! We're into six minutes of added time after that VAR check, and Everton win a free-kick on the left. Kaminski doesn't get any distance on his punched clearance and Garner hits it on the volley as it drops. Burke blocks it in front of the line.
There are big shouts for a handball from the home fans and players as it strikes Bell. He was stood very close to Garner with his arm low by his side, and the referee gives a shake of his head.
Everton are searching for a goal that would take them into the break level. They're switching it from side to side, and Mykolenko finally finds some space, but Kaminski plucks his cross straight out of the air.
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 1-2 LUTON TOWN.
Luton take a 2-1 lead over Everton into half-time. It was the hosts with all of the early chances, but they struggled to test Kaminski. Luton took the lead through Lockyer - Doughty's corner was thumped against the underside of the bar by Morris, and the Hatters captain threw himself in front of Young's clearance to send it into the goal. Morris then doubled their lead from another set-piece, peeling away to send an unmarked volley past Pickford. At the other end, Garner smacked the bar with a header before Calvert-Lewin prodded home Everton's first home goal of the season to pull one back.
Edwards will be fairly pleased with what he's seen from his side - they soaked up a lot of pressure before exploiting Everton's weaknesses on set-pieces to get their two goals. He'll want to restore that two-goal cushion though. Half-time came at the wrong time for the hosts as they were starting to assert some dominance again. Calvert-Lewin netted an important goal, and Dyche will want to build on that after the break.
There's a change apiece at the break, starting with Everton. Gueye is taken off, with Harrison on in his place.
And for Luton, it's Burke that's making way, with Andersen replacing him.
Everton get us back under way for the second half!
Luton are looking to make a strong start to the second half, and they're keeping Everton penned back in their own half. Ogbene tries to cut inside from the left, but Young stands his ground to stop him from getting into the box.
Everton haven't really got going so far in the second half. They're struggling to string passes together, and Luton look comfortable at the moment.
The space opens up for Brown in the box and as he shapes to shoot, Tarkowski slides in with a perfectly-timed tackle to take it off him. Doughty takes the resulting corner, but this one sails over everyone.
Everton work it quickly upfield, but they're struggling to get the ball into the box. They're still looking to their left side to make something happen, but it's not coming off.
Lockyer went down in need of treatment, and Luton aren't going to risk him. He makes his way off the pitch with the medical team, and Mengi comes on to make his Premier League debut.
Ogbene goes down, asking for a free-kick that doesn't come. From that, Pickford plays out from the back, looking to get his side upfield. Onana tries to slide it down the right for Harrison, but Doughty shields it out of play.
Everton are making their second change as they continue their search for an equaliser. Doucoure is taken off, with Beto on in his place.
CHANCE! It's better from Everton here as Tarkowski loops another long ball over the top. Calvert-Lewin watches it drop over his shoulder and hits it on the volley, but his effort dribbles just wide of the far post.
OFFSIDE! Luton go straight down the other end and put the ball in the net, but it won't count! Doughty clips a good cross into the far post and Brown nods it over Pickford. Morris is on the line to help it over the line, but a belated flag goes up against Brown.
Branthwaite and Morris collide during an aerial challenge and the referee waves on the medical teams due to both players holding their heads.
Morris and Branthwaite are both back on their feet now and they'll be able to carry on after finishing their treatment.
Luton win a throw-in, and Kabore looks like he's going to take it before handing it over to Andersen instead. The referee doesn't like that, and Kabore is booked for time-wasting.
Doughty's latest corner hits Garner as it's swung in, and VAR is just having a quick look at it. It did strike the midfielder on the arm, but he was moving it down to his side, and there won't be a penalty awarded to Luton.
Harrison gets a yard on Bell as he drives down the right and he clips a deep cross into the six-yard box. Kaminski chooses to leave it, and Beto reaches it on the far side, but can only put it into the side netting.
Harrison switches play out to Mykolenko on the left, and he lays it off into Beto's path. He has space for a shot, but chooses to leave it for McNeil instead, which allows Luton to get back and block it.
There are more big shouts for a penalty, this time from the home fans. McNeil plays a good reverse pass into Calvert-Lewin, who goes shoulder-to-shoulder with Mengi, and when the forward goes down, the referee waves the claim away.
GREAT CHANCE! McNeil has people to aim for in the box this time, and he curls it into the far post, where Garner nods it down. Beto has a free header and flicks it towards the near top corner from close range, but it sails over the bar.
Garner cuts open Luton's backline with a great pass into the box, and Beto races onto it. He stumbles over the ball and manages to scuff a shot just wide from a tight angle.
Luton are making their second change here. Morris, whose goal is the difference at the moment, is replaced by Adebayo.
And Everton's latest change sees Patterson coming on for Young.
Luton are sitting deep and trying to make life difficult for Everton in the final third. Harrison plays a hopeful ball into the box from the right, but it's an easy one for Kabore to deal with at the far post.
Luton have a problem here as Kaminski is down in his box with a groin problem. The physio is on to give him some treatment, but he's okay to carry on.
Luton are making another change as they get ready to defend this Everton corner. Doughty goes off, with Woodrow on in his place.
Final roll of the dice for Everton now as Danjuma is brought on for McNeil.
OVER! Everton are upping the pressure here and after the first cross is cleared, the hosts recycle it. Garner lifts it into the far post and Beto thumps a header across goal which sails over the bar.
Luton are still standing their ground at the back, and Everton are desperately trying to get it forward. At the moment, they're struggling to string together enough passes to do that.
Mpanzu makes another good interception and drives down the right. His only aim is to keep Everton out of Luton's half by dragging the hosts back towards their own goal.
WIDE! Tarkowski has played some wonderful long balls over the top today, and this one is no different as he drops it into Calvert-Lewin. He lets it bounce before firing on goal, but he hits the side netting.
Everton are very much going for the direct route as Tarkowski sends it long once more. This time, he picks out Onana on the right of the box and he nods it towards Beto, but Bell is there for Luton.
Luton have everyone back in their own half as they continue to protect what would be a precious first-ever Premier League win. Brown does well as he drags Mykolenko out to him and wins a goal-kick off the left-back.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 1-2 LUTON TOWN.
Luton win their first-ever Premier League game, beating Everton 2-1. All of the work was done in the first half from two set-pieces. The first was a corner, which Morris thumped against the crossbar, and Lockyer threw himself in front of Young's clearance to deflect it into the net. Then a free-kick, where Doughty picked out the unmarked Morris, and he volleyed past Pickford. Everton responded well, with Garner rattling the bar with a header before Calvert-Lewin poked a goal back from close range. The Toffees desperately pushed in the second half, but couldn't manage to test Kaminski.
It's a win that lifts Luton out of the relegation zone and up to 17th, only behind Everton now on goal difference. They'll play their game in hand against Burnley in midweek. That's four home defeats on the bounce for the Toffees, who go off to boos. They'll be hoping to change that against Bournemouth next weekend.
That's all for today, goodbye!"	"In-form Newcastle United earned a fourth win in five Premier League matches as eased past Crystal Palace 4-0 at St James’ Park. 
The home team got off to a dream start as Jacob Murphy opened the scoring in the fourth minute. Kieran Trippier’s sumptuous cushioned pass set up Murphy down the right channel to send a brilliant lob over Sam Johnstone and into the far corner. 
Anthony Gordon, back from suspension, missed a glorious chance to double the lead but could only hit the bar from close range. He made amends just before half-time, converting first-time Murphy’s brilliant cross at the far post. 
There was still time for a third Newcastle goal before the break, Sean Longstaff profiting from a slip by Marc Guehi to advance into the area and score. 
Murphy was also involved in the fourth with his cross-pass finding Callum Wilson to finish midway through the second half. 
The win lifts Newcastle to fifth, with 16 points. 
Palace are 11th with 12 points.
Referee: Tim Robinson. Assistants: Adrian Holmes, Simon Long. Fourth official: Keith Stroud. VAR: Simon Hooper. Assistant VAR: James Mainwaring."	Team_15	Team_8	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Team_9 and Team_12 at Goodison Park!\nIt's been a good week for Team_9 - they picked up their first Premier League win of the season last time out, beating Team_4 3-1 on Saturday before following it up with an EFL Cup third-round win over Team_2 in midweek to progress to the next round. They're looking to keep building on this momentum and turn around their fortunes at home after failing to win and score in all three of their games at Goodison Park so far.\nLuton, on the other hand, are still looking for their first win in the league this season, but did get their first point on the board in a 1-1 draw with 10-man Team_20 last weekend. They've lost their other four games in the competition, and come into this game after being knocked out of the EFL Cup by League One side, Exeter City, in their midweek match.\nTeam_9 STARTING XI (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ashley Young, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; James Garner, Amadou Onana, Idrissa Gueye, Dwight McNeil; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nTeam_9 SUBS: Lewis Dobbin, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Michael Keane, Ben Godfrey, Arnaut Danjuma, Jack Harrison, Joao Virginia, Nathan Patterson.\nTeam_12 STARTING XI (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Reece Burke, Tom Lockyer, Amari'i Bell; Issa Kabore, Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, Marvelous Nakamba, Alfie Doughty; Jacob Brown, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris.\nTeam_12 SUBS: Ryan Giles, Cauley Woodrow, Luke Berry, Joseph Johnson, Teden Mengi, Tahith Chong, Elijah Adebayo, Mads Andersen, Tim Krul.\nSean Dyche makes four changes from the side that knocked Villa out of the EFL Cup on Wednesday. Young, Gueye, McNeil and Doucoure are all brought in, while Mykolenko has passed a late fitness test to retain his place. Keane, Patterson, Harrison and Danjuma drop to the bench.\nAfter ringing in the changes for their midweek loss to Exeter, Rob Edwards goes back to the side that drew with Team_20 in their last Premier League game, with one enforced alteration. Albert Sambi Lokonga picked up a hamstring injury in that match, so he's out. Mpanzu comes in to replace him.\nThe teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!\nOgbene gets the game under way for Luton!\nIt's Team_9 trying to pile on some early pressure and it's knocked back to Tarkowski who sends it long over the top. Doucoure has made a good run through the middle, but Lockyer gets across to cut it out.\nCLOSE! Doucoure's pass out to McNeil on the left is short, but a lazy touch by Kabore helps it into the winger's feet anyway. It bounces up in front of him and he strikes it on the volley, but it flashes wide of the far post.\nSAVE! It's lovely work from Team_9 down the left, but Mykolenko's cross is put out from a throw-in. The left-back gets it straight back from Doucoure and this time picks out a good ball, but Calvert-Lewin's header is straight at Kaminski.\nIt's a good, darting run from Ogbene down the left, and he pulls it back to Nakamba when he spots him in space on the edge of the box. He leans back as he takes the shot though, and it's always rising over the bar.\nLuton are winless in their six league games against Team_9 (D3 L3), with this the first such meeting between the sides since a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park in March 1992.\nWIDE! Luton are wide open at the back and Doucoure switches play wonderfully out to Garner in acres of space down the right. He cuts onto his left foot and then tries to place it, but instead curls it wide of the far post.\nCHANCE! It's more good play from Team_9 as Onana threads it through to Doucoure. He can't get a sight of goal so knocks it back for Gueye on the edge of the box, but he fires his first-time shot wide of the near post.\nOnana finds another pocket of space in midfield and he floats a lovely pass out to Garner on the right. He plays a dangerous low ball across the six-yard box, but nobody's there for Team_9.\nWIDE! Team_9 miss another good chance! They knock it neatly down the left, and Mykolenko flicks it to Onana. He tries to whip a shot towards the far bottom corner, but just can't get it on target.\nDown the other end, Morris holds the ball up before teeing up Ogbene for another driving run down the left. He pulls it back to the penalty spot towards Brown, but Onana gets back in time to hook it away.\nLuton are starting to grow into this game, and Bell plays a good reverse pass into Doughty on the left. He holds the ball up instead of putting it into the box, but does manage to win a corner.\nOVER! The resulting corner is swung in by Doughty, and his out-swinging cross picks out Lockyer in the middle. He rises high to thump a header towards goal, but it flies over the bar.\nOnana is screaming for the ball in midfield and Garner eventually picks him out. He tries to slide it into the box for Calvert-Lewin, but they're not on the same wavelength, so it's a comfortable take for Kaminski.\nLOCKYER SCORES! Team_9 just haven't been able to cope with Luton on corners, and the visitors have punished them! Doughty swings another dangerous cross in and Morris thumps a header on goal. It hits the bottom of the crossbar and bounces in front of Young, who tries to clear it. He hits the ball straight against Lockyer, who throws himself in front of it, and it hits the back of the net. 1-0 Luton!\nTeam_9 are looking to regain some of their earlier dominance and it's hooked upfield to Calvert-Lewin again. This time, he fouls his man trying to nod it down, and Luton have a free-kick.\nMpanzu went down after being shrugged off the ball in midfield, and he's holding his side. He slowly gets back up to his feet, and he can carry on without treatment.\nCHANCE! Team_9 threat comes from their left again, and McNeil jinks past Morris before whipping a dangerous cross into Calvert-Lewin. He can't get enough contact on the ball though, and ends up glancing it wide.\nOnana has nicked the ball off Morris, but Tarkowski bundles into the forward, giving away a needless free-kick, which Doughty is standing over.\nMORRIS SCORES! The forward peels away from the line of Team_9 defenders on the edge of the box, and he's completely free at the far post. Doughty picks him out, and Morris meets the ball on the half-volley, sending it across goal and out of Pickford's reach. 2-0 Luton!\nIt's another delightful delivery from Doughty, who is causing Team_9 all sorts of problems with the set-pieces that he's taking.\nThe rain is coming down even heavier now, and the slick surface is causing a few problems. Morris nods it forward for Ogbene, and Young's pass almost plays in the winger, but he manages to get it back to Pickford.\nGueye finds himself in a pocket of space just outside the box and shapes to shoot before deciding against it. Instead, he touches it out to Mykolenko, but nobody is in the middle for the hosts to meet his cross.\nOFF THE BAR! Team_9 work it well down their left once more, and McNeil floats a great cross towards the far post. Garner darts forward to meet it and thumps a header on goal. Kaminski is beaten, but it smacks off the crossbar.\nTeam_9 are still seeing a lot of the ball, but they're finding it difficult to break down Luton. Tarkowski lifts another long ball over the top that forces Calvert-Lewin wide, which means that nobody is in the box for the hosts again.\nCALVERT-LEWIN PULLS ONE BACK! Pickford's long ball is only half-cleared by Luton and Garner swings a follow-up cross into the middle. Onana is onside as he pokes it on goal, but Kaminski denies him. The keeper then scrambles across to deny Doucoure from close range but he can't get to Calvert-Lewin's prod. VAR is having a long look, but it'll count!\nVAR is checking two things on this goal. The first is whether or not there was a foul on Burke in the build-up, and that's cleared up pretty quickly. The second is whether or not Calvert-Lewin is offside. It's a tight call, and it's taking some time to figure out.\nTHE GOAL STANDS! Team_9 have their first home goal of the season! Burke was leaning slightly to the left, and it's his shoulder that was playing Calvert-Lewin onside. It's 2-1!\nBLOCK! We're into six minutes of added time after that VAR check, and Team_9 win a free-kick on the left. Kaminski doesn't get any distance on his punched clearance and Garner hits it on the volley as it drops. Burke blocks it in front of the line.\nThere are big shouts for a handball from the home fans and players as it strikes Bell. He was stood very close to Garner with his arm low by his side, and the referee gives a shake of his head.\nTeam_9 are searching for a goal that would take them into the break level. They're switching it from side to side, and Mykolenko finally finds some space, but Kaminski plucks his cross straight out of the air.\nHALF-TIME: Team_9 1-2 Team_12.\nLuton take a 2-1 lead over Team_9 into half-time. It was the hosts with all of the early chances, but they struggled to test Kaminski. Luton took the lead through Lockyer - Doughty's corner was thumped against the underside of the bar by Morris, and the Hatters captain threw himself in front of Young's clearance to send it into the goal. Morris then doubled their lead from another set-piece, peeling away to send an unmarked volley past Pickford. At the other end, Garner smacked the bar with a header before Calvert-Lewin prodded home Team_9 first home goal of the season to pull one back.\nEdwards will be fairly pleased with what he's seen from his side - they soaked up a lot of pressure before exploiting Team_9 weaknesses on set-pieces to get their two goals. He'll want to restore that two-goal cushion though. Half-time came at the wrong time for the hosts as they were starting to assert some dominance again. Calvert-Lewin netted an important goal, and Dyche will want to build on that after the break.\nThere's a change apiece at the break, starting with Team_9. Gueye is taken off, with Harrison on in his place.\nAnd for Luton, it's Burke that's making way, with Andersen replacing him.\nTeam_9 get us back under way for the second half!\nLuton are looking to make a strong start to the second half, and they're keeping Team_9 penned back in their own half. Ogbene tries to cut inside from the left, but Young stands his ground to stop him from getting into the box.\nTeam_9 haven't really got going so far in the second half. They're struggling to string passes together, and Luton look comfortable at the moment.\nThe space opens up for Brown in the box and as he shapes to shoot, Tarkowski slides in with a perfectly-timed tackle to take it off him. Doughty takes the resulting corner, but this one sails over everyone.\nTeam_9 work it quickly upfield, but they're struggling to get the ball into the box. They're still looking to their left side to make something happen, but it's not coming off.\nLockyer went down in need of treatment, and Luton aren't going to risk him. He makes his way off the pitch with the medical team, and Mengi comes on to make his Premier League debut.\nOgbene goes down, asking for a free-kick that doesn't come. From that, Pickford plays out from the back, looking to get his side upfield. Onana tries to slide it down the right for Harrison, but Doughty shields it out of play.\nTeam_9 are making their second change as they continue their search for an equaliser. Doucoure is taken off, with Beto on in his place.\nCHANCE! It's better from Team_9 here as Tarkowski loops another long ball over the top. Calvert-Lewin watches it drop over his shoulder and hits it on the volley, but his effort dribbles just wide of the far post.\nOFFSIDE! Luton go straight down the other end and put the ball in the net, but it won't count! Doughty clips a good cross into the far post and Brown nods it over Pickford. Morris is on the line to help it over the line, but a belated flag goes up against Brown.\nBranthwaite and Morris collide during an aerial challenge and the referee waves on the medical teams due to both players holding their heads.\nMorris and Branthwaite are both back on their feet now and they'll be able to carry on after finishing their treatment.\nLuton win a throw-in, and Kabore looks like he's going to take it before handing it over to Andersen instead. The referee doesn't like that, and Kabore is booked for time-wasting.\nDoughty's latest corner hits Garner as it's swung in, and VAR is just having a quick look at it. It did strike the midfielder on the arm, but he was moving it down to his side, and there won't be a penalty awarded to Luton.\nHarrison gets a yard on Bell as he drives down the right and he clips a deep cross into the six-yard box. Kaminski chooses to leave it, and Beto reaches it on the far side, but can only put it into the side netting.\nHarrison switches play out to Mykolenko on the left, and he lays it off into Beto's path. He has space for a shot, but chooses to leave it for McNeil instead, which allows Luton to get back and block it.\nThere are more big shouts for a penalty, this time from the home fans. McNeil plays a good reverse pass into Calvert-Lewin, who goes shoulder-to-shoulder with Mengi, and when the forward goes down, the referee waves the claim away.\nGREAT CHANCE! McNeil has people to aim for in the box this time, and he curls it into the far post, where Garner nods it down. Beto has a free header and flicks it towards the near top corner from close range, but it sails over the bar.\nGarner cuts open Luton's backline with a great pass into the box, and Beto races onto it. He stumbles over the ball and manages to scuff a shot just wide from a tight angle.\nLuton are making their second change here. Morris, whose goal is the difference at the moment, is replaced by Adebayo.\nAnd Team_9 latest change sees Patterson coming on for Young.\nLuton are sitting deep and trying to make life difficult for Team_9 in the final third. Harrison plays a hopeful ball into the box from the right, but it's an easy one for Kabore to deal with at the far post.\nLuton have a problem here as Kaminski is down in his box with a groin problem. The physio is on to give him some treatment, but he's okay to carry on.\nLuton are making another change as they get ready to defend this Team_9 corner. Doughty goes off, with Woodrow on in his place.\nFinal roll of the dice for Team_9 now as Danjuma is brought on for McNeil.\nOVER! Team_9 are upping the pressure here and after the first cross is cleared, the hosts recycle it. Garner lifts it into the far post and Beto thumps a header across goal which sails over the bar.\nLuton are still standing their ground at the back, and Team_9 are desperately trying to get it forward. At the moment, they're struggling to string together enough passes to do that.\nMpanzu makes another good interception and drives down the right. His only aim is to keep Team_9 out of Luton's half by dragging the hosts back towards their own goal.\nWIDE! Tarkowski has played some wonderful long balls over the top today, and this one is no different as he drops it into Calvert-Lewin. He lets it bounce before firing on goal, but he hits the side netting.\nTeam_9 are very much going for the direct route as Tarkowski sends it long once more. This time, he picks out Onana on the right of the box and he nods it towards Beto, but Bell is there for Luton.\nLuton have everyone back in their own half as they continue to protect what would be a precious first-ever Premier League win. Brown does well as he drags Mykolenko out to him and wins a goal-kick off the left-back.\nFULL-TIME: Team_9 1-2 Team_12.\nLuton win their first-ever Premier League game, beating Team_9 2-1. All of the work was done in the first half from two set-pieces. The first was a corner, which Morris thumped against the crossbar, and Lockyer threw himself in front of Young's clearance to deflect it into the net. Then a free-kick, where Doughty picked out the unmarked Morris, and he volleyed past Pickford. Team_9 responded well, with Garner rattling the bar with a header before Calvert-Lewin poked a goal back from close range. The Toffees desperately pushed in the second half, but couldn't manage to test Kaminski.\nIt's a win that lifts Luton out of the relegation zone and up to 17th, only behind Team_9 now on goal difference. They'll play their game in hand against Team_6 in midweek. That's four home defeats on the bounce for the Toffees, who go off to boos. They'll be hoping to change that against Team_3 next weekend.\nThat's all for today, goodbye!""]"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93576	Crystal Palace	Burnley	2024-02-24	Selhurst Park, London	24042.0	Lewis Smith	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Everton and Crystal Palace at Goodison Park.
As Everton await their verdict after the club appealed against their 10-point deduction earlier in this season, Sean Dyche’s side currently sit in 18th place in the Premier League and are battling to stay in the division. Everton have drawn their last two Premier League matches at Goodison Park – they haven’t drawn three in a row at home since a run of four in January/February 2015. Today, they host a Palace side who haven’t secured the three points in their last eight visits to the Toffees. Dyche’s men need to build some momentum after a tricky run of form, having not won in their last seven league fixtures (D3 L4). A win would see Everton climb above Luton Town and out of the relegation zone.
Palace will be playing their first game without Roy Hodgson, who left the club earlier today and was replaced by Oliver Glasner. Paddy McCarthy and Ray Lewington will lead the team at Goodison Park before Glasner starts his role as manager. The Eagles have lost their last three away Premier League matches, shipping 11 goals, and they will be looking for their first win against Everton in the league since 2021. This will be Palace’s second successive Premier League match played on a Monday, after their 3-1 defeat to Chelsea last week. Indeed, it will be the Eagles’ 16th Monday fixture in the competition over the last four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), at least two more than any other club.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ben Godfrey; Dwight McNeil, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner, Ashley Young; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Amadou Onana, Jack Harrison, Joao Virginia, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Lewis Dobbin.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-3-3): Sam Johnstone; Tyrick Mitchell, Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Daniel Munoz; Jefferson Lerma, Chris Richards, Adam Wharton; Odsonne Edouard, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: James Tomkins, Matheus Franca, Nathaniel Clyne, Naouirou Ahamada, Dean Henderson, Jairo Riedewald, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh-Chibueze, Jadan Raymond.
Dyche has made just one change from Everton’s previous fixture against Manchester City, where the Toffees were defeated 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Doucoure returns to the starting XI after a spell on the treatment table. Harrison is the player to make way, and he will drop to the bench.
Meanwhile, Palace have made three alterations from their defeat at home to Chelsea last time out. There’s a change between the sticks, with Henderson dropping to the bench and Johnstone coming into the side. Ward is also named in the starting XI, and he will replace Will Hughes, who fails to make the squad. The third and final change sees Edouard selected ahead of Franca in attack for the Eagles.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Wharton gets the game under way for Palace at Goodison Park!
Palace are lining up with Richards in a back three with Andersen and Ward, with Munoz and Mitchell as wing-backs. The Eagles have opted for a slight change of system to their usual formation, with the capital club struggling in the Premier League so far this season.
Palace have an opportunity to test Everton from a corner, with Wharton standing over it. He delivers towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin is there to head it away. The ball comes back to Wharton on the left-hand side, but the young midfielder's cross goes straight into the hands of Pickford between the sticks.
Everton are starting to show a bit of attacking intent as Mykolenko slots a throughball towards Calvert-Lewin. He holds it up and finds McNeil, but his cross is overhit. Godfrey races over to prevent a throw-in, and manages to win one for the Toffees deep inside the Palace half, but it comes to nothing.
The Toffees keep possession well before Tarkowski sends a long, searching ball to Mykolenko, and Ward is forced to head behind for a corner. Garner is there to take and he delivers towards the penalty spot, but Edouard is able to head it away. The Eagles then look to counter-attack, but Garner gives away a free-kick near the halfway line.
Everton win the ball back and Doucoure leads the counter-attack for Everton. He holds it up, waiting for his team-mates to join him, and he switches the play to Godfrey. The full-back gets it out of his feet and delivers into the penalty area towards Calvert-Lewin, but Johnstone is able to come off his line and catch it.
Chance for Palace! Branthwaite fails to clear the ball and Mateta can turn and drive towards the penalty area. He finds Edouard just inside the box, and the French striker gets it out of his feet and shifts it onto his left. He strikes it low and hard towards goal, but Pickford gets his body behind it and makes a comfortable save.
Wharton's throughball finds Mateta, but he's offside and Everton will have a free-kick. Pickford is there to take it and he sends it long in search of Calvert-Lewin, who has made a run in and behind the Palace defence. He's burst away from his marker, but he can't quite latch onto it and it falls to Johnstone.
Another long ball from Pickford in behind sends McNeil and Ward chasing towards the Palace goal. The Eagles defender wins the battle, but his clearance is tame and it falls to Doucoure just outside the penalty area. The Everton midfielder strikes it from outside of the box, but it just goes wide of the post and behind for a goal-kick.
Calvert-Lewin holds the ball up well and finds Garner, and Everton recycle possession. It comes to Tarkowski who sends a long ball towards Mykolenko, but Palace deal with it and Ayew clears. The Toffees come again and Tarkowski searches for McNeil's run in behind, but Andersen does well to head the ball back to his goalkeeper.
So close to an opener for Everton! Garner flicks the ball into the feet of Doucoure, who does well to shift it out wide to McNeil. The winger whips a dangerous delivery into the penalty area towards Calvert-Lewin, who rises above Andersen and heads towards goal, but it whistles past the post and behind for a goal-kick.
Pickford gets away with one! Andersen hits a long pass behind the Everton defensive line, and the goalkeeper rushes out of his box to deal with it. Pickford goes to clear the ball, but it cannons off Edouard. Thankfully for the England international, it flies off the side of the pitch for a throw-in to the Toffees.
Garner fires a pass into the feet of Calvert-Lewin, who turns expertly away from Lerma, and the Palace midfielder brings him down right on the edge of the box. McNeil and Garner are standing over it and the latter will take, but he whips it over the bar and into the stands behind the goal.
Everton are pushing for the opener! McNeil turns and finds Mykolenko on the left-hand side. The Ukrainian left-back sends a first-time cross into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin leaps above his marker but can't quite get to it, and Young fails to connect properly at the back post. He could only flick the ball away from danger.
Palace have a free-kick in a promising position as Gueye trips Mitchell on the left, deep inside the Everton half. Wharton will be the player to take and he delivers towards the front post, but Doucoure will clear. It eventually comes to Andersen who crosses into the box, but Tarkowski gets his head to it and the Toffees can clear the danger.
Palace have only managed one shot since the game got under way, with the Eagles struggling to show any threat in the final third. The Toffees have produced five shots, but they are yet to test Johnstone between the sticks. It's been a game of little quality in attack for either side.
Big chance for Palace! Ayew turns just outside the Everton penalty area and the Eagles have an overload on the right-hand side. He fires a pass out wide to Munoz who plays it first time into Lerma just inside the box, but he snatches at his shot with his weak foot and it flies over the bar. A bit of composure there and he could have scored!
McNeil goes down under the challenge of Wharton but the referee waves play on. Palace can now break away and Edouard drives down the left-hand side and into the penalty area, and Tarkowski gives away a corner. Wharton will deliver and takes aim towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin clears. The ball comes back into the box and Richards heads towards goal, but Tarkowski puts it behind once again.
Off the line! Palace are pushing now. Another corner comes into the Everton penalty area and Mateta climbs highest to win the header. It's flying towards the bottom corner and Pickford might not get there, but Young is there to hack the ball away on the line. The Toffees get away with one!
It's become a scrappy game as we head towards half-time, with neither side able to keep hold of possession for too long, gifting it back to the opposition. Both teams need to show a little more control in midfield if they want to secure a positive result in this match.
Goodison Park is growing frustrated as Everton have an ideal opportunity to counter-attack, but McNeil opts to turn back towards his own goal and keep possession. The Toffees need to take some more risks as they approach the final third. It wouldn't be a surprise to see either manager make a change early in the second half.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of one minute of added time at the end of the first half.
HALF-TIME: EVERTON 0-0 CRYSTAL PALACE
Everton and Palace go into the break at 0-0. It's been a game of minimal chances from either side at Goodison Park, with a real lack of attacking quality on show. There have been just two shots on target for both teams combined, with neither team creating more than 0.39 expected goals (xG). The Toffees have enjoyed slightly more of the possession, but Dyche will be demanding a lot more from his players when they get into the final third. The lack of goals in the first half might not be a surprise to regular watchers of Palace and Everton, as they have been goalless at half-time 12 and 10 times respectively in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.
Both Everton and Palace have plenty of attacking options on the bench, and it certainly wouldn't be a surprise to see some early changes when the second half gets under way. The Toffees could call upon Dobbin or Harrison to provide something different on the wing, with Young and McNeil struggling to make an impact on the game. The Eagles may turn to the likes of Franca or Ahamada to add a little flair in the final third. Will we see some goals after the break?
Everton and Palace share the points as the game finishes 1-1 at Goodison Park. The first half was a quiet affair with both teams struggling to create any clear-cut chances. The two teams headed into the break at 0-0, but the second half had plenty of action. The Toffees enjoyed more of the attacking play and were unfortunate not to take the lead, as Tarkowski and Doucoure both saw efforts scrambled off the line from a corner. Just a few moments later, Palace broke the deadlock as Ayew fired a wonderful strike into the top corner, leaving Pickford with no chance. Dyche's side threw everything at it to try and find an equaliser, and they eventually found one as Onana powered a header into the back of the net from a McNeil set-piece. Everton are now winless in their last eight Premier League matches (D4 L4) since a four-game winning run in December. It’s their longest run without a win since failing to win any of their last eight games under Frank Lampard (October 2022 – January 2023). Palace secure an impressive point on the road, considering the uncertainty behind the scenes with Hodgson leaving the club earlier in the day. That's all for today, goodbye!
Garner gets the second half under way for Everton at Goodison Park!
Young upends Mitchell on the left-hand side and Palace can now fill the penalty area from a free-kick. Wharton is standing over it and he delivers into the box, sending a searching ball to the back post. However, the referee has spotted a foul on Tarkowski and Everton are awarded a free-kick.
Mateta goes down inside the penalty area after a challenge from Branthwaite, but the referee waves play on. The travelling Palace supporters aren't happy, though the official isn't having any of it and the game continues.
Tarkowski fires a ball into the feet of Calvert-Lewin who is brought down by Andersen and Everton win a free-kick. They take it quickly and McNeil receives the ball out wide before delivering into the penalty area, but Mitchell is there and Palace are able to clear the danger comfortably.
Chance for Everton! Mykolenko finds Calvert-Lewin with a superb pass between the lines, and the English striker turns and carries the ball down the line. He flicks the ball into the feet of Young who spots McNeil just outside the box. He shifts it to Garner on the edge of the box and he takes aim towards goal, but his strike flies over the bar.
Chance for Palace now! Mateta wins the ball off Tarkowski and Mitchell has made a bursting run down the left-hand side and into the box. Mateta finds him and he only has Pickford to beat, but the Everton goalkeeper rushes off his line to close the angle and makes a smart stop. The Eagles might feel that was a good opportunity to take the lead.
Edouard should do better! Palace have a corner and it's floated into the penalty area. Andersen leaps above the Everton defence and heads towards goal. It falls to Edouard from inside the six-yard box, but he gets his acrobatic effort all wrong and the ball goes flying into the stands. The Toffees will have a goal-kick.
Close for Everton! Garner wins a free-kick and the Toffees flood the penalty area. It's delivered into the box and headed away, but only as far as Mykolenko who attempts an ambitious volley. It's flying towards goal, but Palace fling plenty of bodies in front of the shot and are able to make the block.
What a chance for Everton! A corner comes into the box from Garner and Tarkowski meets it with his head, but Johnstone makes a superb stop! It falls to Gueye on the edge of the area and he strikes it towards goal. A deflection finds Doucoure, who helps it on at the back post but it's cleared off the line with Godfrey flying in! The Toffees are pushing!
Dyche makes a change on the right-hand side of attack, with Young making way for Harrison.
There's an alteration in the middle of the park for the Toffees, with Gueye removed for Onana to enter the fray.
Mateta held the ball up superbly, allowing him to bring Ayew into play, with the Palace forward doing the rest.
GOOAAAAAALLLL!! 1-0 PALACE!! It's a screamer! The ball comes to Mateta who tussles with Branthwaite, but the striker holds it up well just outside of the box. Onana makes a tackle but it falls to Ayew, who gets it out of his feet and unleashes a thunderous right-footed strike towards the top-left corner, and it flies into the back of the net. What a finish!
The Toffees might feel the goal was against the run of play after they came so close to finding the back of the net just a few minutes earlier, but it was a rare attack from Everton. Ayew took his goal superbly, and Dyche needs to come up with something to get his side back into the game at Goodison Park.
Dyche makes an attacking change for Everton, with Portuguese striker Beto coming on for Doucoure.
Palace make their first alteration of the game, with Ahamada introduced in place of Edouard.
Everton have switched to a 4-4-2 setup as they chase an equaliser, with Beto coming on and partnering Calvert-Lewin in attack. Palace are sitting deep as they look to hold onto their lead, with the Toffees throwing everything at it to get back into the game.
Mitchell does well to win a corner from Harrison and Palace send their defenders forward. It's whipped into the penalty area by Wharton towards Richards, but he can't quite connect with it properly. The Eagles regain possession and push down the right, but the Toffees win a throw-in.
So close to an equaliser! McNeil cuts inside from the left and creates space for himself to deliver into the box. He floats the ball towards the back post and Calvert-Lewin rises to head towards goal, but it whistles past the post and behind for a goal-kick. It was a great chance for the Everton striker. The Toffees are starting to turn the screw!
Ayew has gone down inside the Everton half, and Mitchell quickly joins him on the deck on the left-hand side. The Everton supporters aren't happy as time ticks away. After a short delay, both players are back on their feet and play can continue.
What a chance for Everton! Tarkowski floats the ball into the penalty area and Calvert-Lewin does well to head the ball down to the edge of the box. It falls to Garner who looks to place it into the corner, but Johnstone makes a superb save to deny him and it goes behind for a corner.
GOOOAAAAAALLLLL!!! 1-1!! Everton equalise! From the resulting corner, McNeil stands over it and whips a dangerous delivery towards the back post. Onana leaps higher than everyone inside the box and powers a header into the back of the net! Johnstone couldn't deal with the set-piece and the Toffees are back in it! Only Arsenal (11) have scored more goals from corners than Everton (10) in the Premier League this season, and what a time to add another!
McNeil's corner was delivered perfectly onto the head of Onana, who nodded it home after Johnstone appeared caught in two minds and was unable to punch away.
Tarkowski sends a long ball towards Mykolenko on the left, and he controls the ball into the path of McNeil, who wins a free-kick from Lerma in a dangerous position. McNeil will take and it's delivered into the box. Tarkowski is there to head it, but he sends it over the bar from just a few yards out. He has to do better!
Ayew goes into the referee's book for dissent.
Palace make another change, as young midfielder Ozoh enters the fray. January signing Wharton heads to the bench.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of six minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Everton are still throwing everything forward despite finding an equaliser. Palace appear happy with the point, with Johnstone taking plenty of time when the ball drops to his feet. It would be a great result for the Eagles, who have struggled at Goodison Park in the past.
Lerma is the latest player to receive a yellow card for a late challenge.
FULL-TIME: EVERTON 1-1 CRYSTAL PALACE
Everton and Palace share the points as the game finishes 1-1 at Goodison Park. The first half was a quiet affair with both teams struggling to create any clear-cut chances. The two teams headed into the break at 0-0, but the second half had plenty of action. The Toffees enjoyed more of the attacking play and were unfortunate not to take the lead, as Tarkowski and Doucoure both saw efforts scrambled off the line from a corner. Just a few moments later, Palace broke the deadlock as Ayew fired a wonderful strike into the top corner, leaving Pickford with no chance. Dyche's side threw everything at it to try and find an equaliser, and they eventually found one as Onana powered a header into the back of the net from a McNeil set-piece. Everton are now winless in their last eight Premier League matches (D4 L4) since a four-game winning run in December. It’s their longest run without a win since failing to win any of their last eight games under Frank Lampard (October 2022 – January 2023). Palace secure an impressive point on the road, considering the uncertainty behind the scenes with Hodgson leaving the club earlier in the day. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Oliver Glasner enjoyed a dream debut as Crystal Palace’s new manager with three goals in 11 minutes to give the Eagles a comfortable 3-0 win against 10-man Burnley.
The Austrian became only the second of 15 Palace managers to win their opening Premier League match, making an inspired double change on 66 minutes to break the Clarets’ resistance after Josh Brownhill had been shown a straight red card in the first half for a foul on Jefferson Lerma.
Just two minutes after Glasner’s tactical switch, Jordan Ayew crossed for Chris Richards to open the scoring, before substitute Matheus Franca set up Ayew for a second after 71 minutes. Franca then drew a penalty that Jean-Philippe Mateta converted for Palace’s third.
Glasner named an unchanged starting XI from the side that drew 1-1 with Everton on Monday, while Vincent Kompany’s Burnley suffered a fresh blow in their relegation fight with confirmation that midfielder Aaron Ramsey is out of the rest of the season with a knee injury sustained in their 5-0 defeat by Arsenal last Saturday.
Palace nearly got off to a dream start for their new manager when a clever 12th-minute set-piece routine between Ayew and Adam Wharton found Lerma on the edge of the box, but the Colombian fired over.
In a fairly quiet opening, Palace dominated possession but found a Burnley defence - that had shipped three goals in each of their last three away matches - in a stubborn mood.
However the dismissal of Brownhill for a shirt tug on Lerma, when the Palace midfielder intercepted a backpass to go through on goal, left the Clarets with a numerical disadvantage, and nearly an hour still to play.
Odsonne Edouard grazed the top of the bar with the resulting free-kick as the Eagles went close moments after Kompany had replaced Zeki Amdouni with Josh Cullen in a tactical switch to give the Clarets an extra man in midfield.
The second half quickly shaped up in the same manner as the first - Burnley soaking up the pressure, looking to spring on the counter, while continuing to frustrate their hosts with great defensive blocks to deny Edouard and Daniel Munoz.
Indeed the visitors, who did not have a shot on goal in the opening 45 minutes, registered their first clear chance just before the hour-mark when Lorenz Assignon’s floated delivery picked out David Datro Fofana at the back post, but the Chelsea loanee’s header lacked power and direction.
Glasner then made the substitutions that would break Burnley’s resilience, replacing Wharton and Edouard with Naouirou Ahamada and Franca.
Ayew sparked wild scenes of celebration by Glasner when he crossed for Richards to head home the opener - the new manager celebrating on the pitch - with Tyrick Mitchell and Franca combining to set up Ayew, who made it 2-0 from close range in the 71st minute.
Mateta added a third with 11 minutes remaining, calmly sending Trafford the wrong way from the spot after Franca had been fouled by Burnley substitute Vitinho.
Fofana thought he had reduced the arrears three minutes from time, when he nodded in a loose ball but his goal is ruled out for offside on Assignon after a VAR review.
Palace's first win in four matches moves them to 14th spot on 28 points, eight clear of the relegation zone."	Team_8	Team_6	"[""Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_9 and Team_8 at Goodison Park.\nAs Team_9 await their verdict after the club appealed against their 10-point deduction earlier in this season, Sean Dyche’s side currently sit in 18th place in the Premier League and are battling to stay in the division. Team_9 have drawn their last two Premier League matches at Goodison Park – they haven’t drawn three in a row at home since a run of four in January/February 2015. Today, they host a Palace side who haven’t secured the three points in their last eight visits to the Toffees. Dyche’s men need to build some momentum after a tricky run of form, having not won in their last seven league fixtures (D3 L4). A win would see Team_9 climb above Team_12 and out of the relegation zone.\nPalace will be playing their first game without Roy Hodgson, who left the club earlier today and was replaced by Oliver Glasner.\xa0Paddy McCarthy and Ray Lewington will lead the team at Goodison Park before Glasner starts his role as manager.\xa0The Eagles have lost their last three away Premier League matches, shipping 11 goals, and they will be looking for their first win against Team_9 in the league since 2021. This will be Palace’s second successive Premier League match played on a Monday, after their 3-1 defeat to Team_7 last week. Indeed, it will be the Eagles’ 16th Monday fixture in the competition over the last four seasons (2020-21 to 2023-24), at least two more than any other club.\nTeam_9 (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford;\xa0Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ben Godfrey; Dwight McNeil, Idrissa Gueye, James Garner,\xa0Ashley Young; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nTeam_9 SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Amadou Onana, Jack Harrison, Joao Virginia, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Lewis Dobbin.\nTeam_8 (4-3-3): Sam Johnstone; Tyrick Mitchell, Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Daniel Munoz; Jefferson Lerma, Chris Richards, Adam Wharton; Odsonne Edouard, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Jordan Ayew.\nTeam_8 SUBS: James Tomkins, Matheus Franca, Nathaniel Clyne, Naouirou Ahamada, Dean Henderson, Jairo Riedewald, David Ozoh, Franco Umeh-Chibueze, Jadan Raymond.\nDyche has made just one change from Team_9’s previous fixture against Team_13, where the Toffees were defeated 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium. Doucoure returns to the starting XI after a spell on the treatment table. Harrison is the player to make way, and he will drop to the bench.\nMeanwhile, Palace have made three alterations from their defeat at home to Team_7 last time out. There’s a change between the sticks, with Henderson dropping to the bench and Johnstone coming into the side. Ward is also named in the starting XI, and he will replace Will Hughes, who fails to make the squad. The third and final change sees Edouard selected ahead of Franca in attack for the Eagles.\nThe players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.\nWharton gets the game under way for Palace at Goodison Park!\nPalace are lining up with Richards in a back three with Andersen and Ward, with Munoz and Mitchell as wing-backs. The Eagles have opted for a slight change of system to their usual formation, with the capital club struggling in the Premier League so far this season.\nPalace have an opportunity to test Team_9 from a corner, with Wharton standing over it. He delivers towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin is there to head it away. The ball comes back to Wharton on the left-hand side, but the young midfielder's cross goes straight into the hands of Pickford between the sticks.\nTeam_9 are starting to show a bit of attacking intent as Mykolenko slots a throughball towards Calvert-Lewin. He holds it up and finds McNeil, but his cross is overhit. Godfrey races over to prevent a throw-in, and manages to win one for the Toffees deep inside the Palace half, but it comes to nothing.\nThe Toffees keep possession well before Tarkowski sends a long, searching ball to Mykolenko, and Ward is forced to head behind for a corner. Garner is there to take and he delivers towards the penalty spot, but Edouard is able to head it away. The Eagles then look to counter-attack, but Garner gives away a free-kick near the halfway line.\nTeam_9 win the ball back and Doucoure leads the counter-attack for Team_9. He holds it up, waiting for his team-mates to join him, and he switches the play to Godfrey. The full-back gets it out of his feet and delivers into the penalty area towards Calvert-Lewin, but Johnstone is able to come off his line and catch it.\nChance for Palace! Branthwaite fails to clear the ball and Mateta can turn and drive towards the penalty area. He finds Edouard just inside the box, and the French striker gets it out of his feet and shifts it onto his left. He strikes it low and hard towards goal, but Pickford gets his body behind it and makes a comfortable save.\nWharton's throughball finds Mateta, but he's offside and Team_9 will have a free-kick. Pickford is there to take it and he sends it long in search of Calvert-Lewin, who has made a run in and behind the Palace defence. He's burst away from his marker, but he can't quite latch onto it and it falls to Johnstone.\nAnother long ball from Pickford in behind sends McNeil and Ward chasing towards the Palace goal. The Eagles defender wins the battle, but his clearance is tame and it falls to Doucoure just outside the penalty area. The Team_9 midfielder strikes it from outside of the box, but it just goes wide of the post and behind for a goal-kick.\nCalvert-Lewin holds the ball up well and finds Garner, and Team_9 recycle possession. It comes to Tarkowski who sends a long ball towards Mykolenko, but Palace deal with it and Ayew clears. The Toffees come again and Tarkowski searches for McNeil's run in behind, but Andersen does well to head the ball back to his goalkeeper.\nSo close to an opener for Team_9! Garner flicks the ball into the feet of Doucoure, who does well to shift it out wide to McNeil. The winger whips a dangerous delivery into the penalty area towards Calvert-Lewin, who rises above Andersen and heads towards goal, but it whistles past the post and behind for a goal-kick.\nPickford gets away with one! Andersen hits a long pass behind the Team_9 defensive line, and the goalkeeper rushes out of his box to deal with it. Pickford goes to clear the ball, but it cannons off Edouard. Thankfully for the England international, it flies off the side of the pitch for a throw-in to the Toffees.\nGarner fires a pass into the feet of Calvert-Lewin, who turns expertly away from Lerma, and the Palace midfielder brings him down right on the edge of the box. McNeil and Garner are standing over it and the latter will take, but he whips it over the bar and into the stands behind the goal.\nTeam_9 are pushing for the opener! McNeil turns and finds Mykolenko on the left-hand side. The Ukrainian left-back sends a first-time cross into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin leaps above his marker but can't quite get to it, and Young fails to connect properly at the back post. He could only flick the ball away from danger.\nPalace have a free-kick in a promising position as Gueye trips Mitchell on the left, deep inside the Team_9 half. Wharton will be the player to take and he delivers towards the front post, but Doucoure will clear. It eventually comes to Andersen who crosses into the box, but Tarkowski gets his head to it and the Toffees can clear the danger.\nPalace have only managed one shot since the game got under way, with the Eagles struggling to show any threat in the final third. The Toffees have produced five shots, but they are yet to test Johnstone between the sticks. It's been a game of little quality in attack for either side.\nBig chance for Palace! Ayew turns just outside the Team_9 penalty area and the Eagles have an overload on the right-hand side. He fires a pass out wide to Munoz who plays it first time into Lerma just inside the box, but he snatches at his shot with his weak foot and it flies over the bar. A bit of composure there and he could have scored!\nMcNeil goes down under the challenge of Wharton but the referee waves play on. Palace can now break away and Edouard drives down the left-hand side and into the penalty area, and Tarkowski gives away a corner. Wharton will deliver and takes aim towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin clears. The ball comes back into the box and Richards heads towards goal, but Tarkowski puts it behind once again.\nOff the line! Palace are pushing now. Another corner comes into the Team_9 penalty area and Mateta climbs highest to win the header. It's flying towards the bottom corner and Pickford might not get there, but Young is there to hack the ball away on the line. The Toffees get away with one!\nIt's become a scrappy game as we head towards half-time, with neither side able to keep hold of possession for too long, gifting it back to the opposition. Both teams need to show a little more control in midfield if they want to secure a positive result in this match.\nGoodison Park is growing frustrated as Team_9 have an ideal opportunity to counter-attack, but McNeil opts to turn back towards his own goal and keep possession. The Toffees need to take some more risks as they approach the final third. It wouldn't be a surprise to see either manager make a change early in the second half.\nThe fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of one minute of added time at the end of the first half.\nHALF-TIME: Team_9 0-0 Team_8\nTeam_9 and Palace go into the break at 0-0. It's been a game of minimal chances from either side at Goodison Park, with a real lack of attacking quality on show. There have been just two shots on target for both teams combined, with neither team creating more than 0.39 expected goals (xG). The Toffees have enjoyed slightly more of the possession, but Dyche will be demanding a lot more from his players when they get into the final third. The lack of goals in the first half might not be a surprise to regular watchers of Palace and Team_9, as they have been goalless at half-time 12 and 10 times respectively in the Premier League this season, more than any other side.\nBoth Team_9 and Palace have plenty of attacking options on the bench, and it certainly wouldn't be a surprise to see some early changes when the second half gets under way. The Toffees could call upon Dobbin or Harrison to provide something different on the wing, with Young and McNeil struggling to make an impact on the game. The Eagles may turn to the likes of Franca or Ahamada to add a little flair in the final third. Will we see some goals after the break?\nTeam_9 and Palace share the points as the game finishes 1-1 at Goodison Park. The first half was a quiet affair with both teams struggling to create any clear-cut chances. The two teams headed into the break at 0-0, but the second half had plenty of action. The Toffees enjoyed more of the attacking play and were unfortunate not to take the lead, as Tarkowski and Doucoure both saw efforts scrambled off the line from a corner.

It’s their longest run without a win since failing to win any of their last eight games under Frank Lampard (October 2022 – January 2023). Palace secure an impressive point on the road, considering the uncertainty behind the scenes with Hodgson leaving the club earlier in the day. That's all for today, goodbye!\nGarner gets the second half under way for Team_9 at Goodison Park!\nYoung upends Mitchell on the left-hand side and Palace can now fill the penalty area from a free-kick. Wharton is standing over it and he delivers into the box, sending a searching ball to the back post. However, the referee has spotted a foul on Tarkowski and Team_9 are awarded a free-kick.\nMateta goes down inside the penalty area after a challenge from Branthwaite, but the referee waves play on. The travelling Palace supporters aren't happy, though the official isn't having any of it and the game continues.\nTarkowski fires a ball into the feet of Calvert-Lewin who is brought down by Andersen and Team_9 win a free-kick. They take it quickly and McNeil receives the ball out wide before delivering into the penalty area, but Mitchell is there and Palace are able to clear the danger comfortably.\nChance for Team_9! Mykolenko finds Calvert-Lewin with a superb pass between the lines, and the English striker turns and carries the ball down the line. He flicks the ball into the feet of Young who spots McNeil just outside the box. He shifts it to Garner on the edge of the box and he takes aim towards goal, but his strike flies over the bar.\nChance for Palace now! Mateta wins the ball off Tarkowski and Mitchell has made a bursting run down the left-hand side and into the box. Mateta finds him and he only has Pickford to beat, but the Team_9 goalkeeper rushes off his line to close the angle and makes a smart stop. The Eagles might feel that was a good opportunity to take the lead.\nEdouard should do better! Palace have a corner and it's floated into the penalty area. Andersen leaps above the Team_9 defence and heads towards goal. It falls to Edouard from inside the six-yard box, but he gets his acrobatic effort all wrong and the ball goes flying into the stands. The Toffees will have a goal-kick.\nClose for Team_9! Garner wins a free-kick and the Toffees flood the penalty area. It's delivered into the box and headed away, but only as far as Mykolenko who attempts an ambitious volley. It's flying towards goal, but Palace fling plenty of bodies in front of the shot and are able to make the block.\nWhat a chance for Team_9! A corner comes into the box from Garner and Tarkowski meets it with his head, but Johnstone makes a superb stop! It falls to Gueye on the edge of the area and he strikes it towards goal. A deflection finds Doucoure, who helps it on at the back post but it's cleared off the line with Godfrey flying in!

93336	Man City	Newcastle	2023-08-19	Etihad Stadium, Manchester		Robert Jones	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League match between Arsenal and Nottingham Forest at the Emirates Stadium.
The opening weekend of the Premier League continues with reigning champions Manchester City setting the early tempo with a commanding 3-0 win over Burnley on Friday. Arsenal will aim to follow suit as they look to launch their title challenge against the side that ended their pursuit last season.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): Aaron Ramsdale; Thomas Partey, Ben White, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBS: Karl Hein, Gabriel Magalhaes, Emile Smith Rowe, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST (3-4-3): Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall, Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Ryan Yates, Orel Mangala, Ola Aina; Danilo, Brennan Johnson, Morgan Gibbs-White.
SUBS: Ethan Horvath, Neco Williams, Cheikhou Kouyate, Taiwo Awoniyi, Chris Wood, Moussa Niakhite, Anthony Elanga, Remo Freuler, Lewis O'Brien.
Mikel Arteta makes just a single change from last weekend's Community Shield victory - albeit a hugely intriguing one with Nketiah replacing Gabriel, who drops to the bench. In a subsequent tactical reshuffle, White moves across into the heart of defence with Thomas starting at right-back. Havertz moves into an attacking three-man midfield alongside Odegaard and Rice, with Nketiah leading the line.
Meanwhile, Matt Turner starts in goal in the week he joined Forest from Arsenal. The former Gunner is one of two new signings named in Steve Cooper's starting line-up along with Aina, who joined on a free transfer. Interestingly, there is no place for Awoniyi, who enjoyed a strong finish to last season - scoring the winner against Arsenal in May.
It is not the first time the two sides are meeting on the opening weekend of a Premier League season. Indeed, they did the same a quarter of a century ago, Marc Overmars scoring the winner as Arsenal prevailed 2-1 at Highbury.
Kick-off has been delayed by 30 minutes due to an issue at the turnstiles. Stay tuned for further updates.
The stadium is gradually filling up with plenty of fans now taking their seats. We should not be too far from starting here.
Later than planned, but the players are finally making their way out onto the field. Kick-off at the Emirates is moments away.
Michael Oliver is today's referee. He blows his whistle and Forest get the match under way.
Both sides will be looking to address their respective form from last season. Arsenal kept just four Premier League clean sheets on home soil, while Forest had the worst away record in the division - winning just one of 19 matches and registered just eight points.
Arsenal quickly settling into their rhythm and Saka earns a corner via Aina's deflection. But Forest deal with two deliveries into their box.
The Gunners are unbeaten in each of their last nine home league meetings with Forest, winning five and drawing four.
Saka cuts inside from the right wing and seeks out Nketiah with a clever reverse pass. However, it is just lacking the required accuracy and Turner comes out to collect.
Today, Forest are aiming to end a run of four successive opening-day defeats. Although, the start to the game suggests they face a tough task in breaking the streak.
CHANCE! Johnson must do better! Against the run of play, Forest are in behind Arsenal, who went to sleep at the back. Johnson is all on his own as he latches onto Boly's header and beats Ramsdale, but cannot keep his shot on target.
At the other end, Odegaard threads a neat throughball looking for Nketiah. Turner is quickly out to smother the ball, though the Arsenal forward is subsequently ruled offside.
Forest's lacking of a clinical edge was evident with that Johnson opportunity going begging. They only scored three times during pre-season and failed to find the net in each of their final four warm-up matches.
Arsenal continuing to enjoy most of the possession in their opening match of the season. But the Gunners must look to record more attempts on goal.
We are still goalless inside the opening 20 minutes at the Emirates, where Arsenal have fond memories of their last two meetings with Forest. Indeed, both culminated in commanding 5-0 victories for the Gunners. More of the same today would do very nicely for the hosts.
An anxious moment for Forest as Turner's attempted clearance is charged down by Nketiah. Thankfully for the visitors, the ball ricochets well wide of the target, but their hearts will have momentarily been in their mouths.
Forest are trying to gain a foothold in the contest having enjoyed just over 13 per cent of the possession so far. But they just cannot keep the ball from their opponents for long enough at the moment.
The anticipation rises inside the Emirates as Saka has space in the penalty area. His attempted cross ricochets behind off McKenna. Can the hosts make the most of this opportunity?
NKETIAH!!! 1-0 ARSENAL! The Gunners have the breakthrough. Martinelli is the provider as he teases Danilo with neat footwork, before a wonderful turn results in the ball dropping to Nketiah. The forward cuts inside before his drilled shot beats Turner via a slight deflection.
Martinelli teased Danilo before his turn helped the ball into the path of Nketiah, who broke the deadlock.
Aina catches Saka late and receives the first yellow card of the game.
Arsenal have the lead and rightly so after the first half an hour at the Emirates. The Gunners have dominated proceedings and are good value for their advantage.
SAKA!!! 2-0 ARSENAL! What a goal! Forest appear to have dealt with a corner, but Gibbs-White is robbed of possession. Following a neat subsequent exchange of passes, Saka takes aim and bends a stunning 25-yard effort into the far corner.
Saliba provided the lay-off and Saka did the rest in sublime fashion.
Arsenal have a two-goal lead and it is no more than they deserve. The Gunners are in complete control of this contest.
Today, Forest were hoping to party like it's 1999. Indeed, that was the last time they won a Premier League match in London - beating Wimbledon 3-1 at Selhurst Park. But barring a miraculous turnaround here, they will have to wait at least another year for such celebrations.
Arsenal go in search of more goals as they embark on another venture into the Forest penalty area. Nketiah shoots from a tight angle, but it is never troubling the target.
The half-time whistle cannot come quickly enough for Forest as we enter the last five minutes of the first period. They are certainly regretting that wasted Johnson opportunity earlier on.
You must go back to the 1988-89 season for the last time Forest won away at Arsenal, Brian Clough's side prevailing 3-1 at Highbury that day. But as things stand, the wait will almost certainly go on here.
Good effort! On his first Premier League appearance since departing West Ham United, Rice tries his luck from distance. But Turner gets down well to hold onto the former Hammers skipper's attempt.
We are into the first of three additional minutes at the end of this first half.
Timber is in need of medical attention after hurting himself during a strong challenge on Johnson.
Timber has his name taken for that challenge on Johnson. The new signing limps towards the touchline and it is unclear whether or not he will be able to continue here.
Timber is back on the field for the final few seconds of the first half.
HALF-TIME: ARSENAL 2-0 NOTTINGHAM FOREST
Arsenal are well in control as they take a two-goal lead into half-time at the Emirates. Goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka have left Nottingham Forest with a huge mountain to climb in the second half.
Forest have been very much second-best so far, having enjoyed just under 16 per cent of the possession. Although, it could have been a different story had Brennan Johnson converted an earlier opportunity, the Wales forward shooting wide with only Aaron Ramsdale to beat.
We are off and running again at the Emirates with Arsenal kicking things off once more.
Timber goes down again, instantly pulling up as he went to control the ball. It looks like his first Premier League start may end prematurely.
The Emirates applauds Timber, who cannot continue and limps off to be replaced by Tomiyasu.
This marks the 11th time in 12 years that Arsenal are launching their Premier League campaign in London. The only exception was a 1-0 victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park on the opening weekend of 2019-20.
As things stand, it looks like it will be more away-day blues for Forest, who lost 13 Premier League games on the road last season. That is something they must address this term in order to stay clear of relegation danger.
The visitors enjoy a rare opportunity to attack and send a long throw into the box. The ball ricochets kindly for Yates, who draws a smart save from Ramsdale, but the flag is subsequently raised for offside.
It remains to be seen whether or not Ramsdale will be Arsenal's number one for much longer with the Gunners reportedly keen to sign David Raya from Brentford. The England goalkeeper will be eager to remain first choice under Arteta.
Arsenal still 2-0 to the good as we hit the hour mark at the Emirates. The Gunners remain well in control, but it is important they do not become complacent.
Forest have never in their history lost their opening match in five successive seasons. However, that could happen here unless they turn things around.
The visitors attempt to threaten from a free-kick inside their own half. The delivery is flicked on but, at full stretch, Worrall is unable to keep the ball in play.
Forest could look to introduce Awoniyi in an attempt to potentially salvage something from the game. The striker scored in each of their final four Premier League games last season.
Arsenal look for a third goal that would certainly settle the contest. Odegaard whips the ball into the box, but Forest clear.
Aina's ambitious attempt deflects behind for a corner via Thomas. But Forest are unable to make the most of the opportunity.
Forest make a change with Danilo making way for Awoniyi.
Aina is also given a breather by Cooper with Williams.
Arsenal also make a change with Trossard replacing Nketiah.
OFF THE POST! Rice almost has his first goal for Arsenal. The England midfielder goes for placement with a grass-cutting 25-yard attempt, but Turner does brilliantly to get down and tip the ball onto the woodwork.
Forest threaten from a corner at the other end. Boly gets up to meet the delivery, but Rice does just about enough to put him off.
Another Forest change sees Johnson replaced by Elanga, who comes on for his debut.
Mangala drags back Odegaard in an attempt to stop a counter, and goes into the book.
AWONIYI!!! HOPE FOR FOREST! 2-1! The visitors pull a goal back as the two substitutes combine. Elanga races away on the counter before crossing for Awoniyi, who applies a brilliant first-time finish at the near post.
Elanga took full advantage as he galloped into the space down the Arsenal right before crossing for Awoniyi to apply the finishing touch.
Suddenly, Forest have their tails up and go in search of the equaliser. The ball drops for Gibbs-White on the volley, but his 20-yard attempt goes over.
Awoniyi has found the net for a fifth successive game. Stan Collymore is the only Forest player to embark on a longer streak in the Premier League, scoring in six straight matches in 1995.
A tactical change by Arsenal with Gabriel on to replace Martinelli.
The atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense around the Emirates. Arsenal appeared well in control and on course for a comfortable three points. But we are now set for a dramatic finish.
A very attacking change from Forest with Wood on to replace Worrall.
Forest also make a change as Kouyate replaces Mangala.
Arsenal aim to kill the game off with Havertz looking to get in behind. But Aurier makes up vital ground to intercept.
White is the next player into the book for a foul on Williams.
We have just passed the midway point in stoppage time, with seven minutes added by the referee. Forest are still seeking the equaliser, but Arsenal look like they will hold on.
Just 60 seconds of stoppage time remain at the Emirates. Arsenal are nearly there...
Arsenal counter in the dying moments and almost score a third. Saka lays the ball off for Odegaard, who curls a shot narrowly wide of the far post.
FULL-TIME: ARSENAL 2-1 NOTTINGHAM FOREST
Arsenal make a winning start to the 2023-24 Premier League season, but only just. The Gunners dominated most of the contest and established a well-deserved 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka. But substitute Taiwo Awoniyi struck eight minutes from time to give Nottingham Forest hope and ensure a nervy finish at the Emirates. It was just too late, though, as the hosts held on for maximum points.
Forest, who can draw positives from the way they finished the game, will look to bounce back against Sheffield United next Friday. Meanwhile, Arsenal will aim to make it two wins from two against Crystal Palace three days later.

Team_13	Team_15	"[""Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League match between Team_1 and Team_16 at the Emirates Stadium.\nThe opening weekend of the Premier League continues with reigning champions Team_13 setting the early tempo with a commanding 3-0 win over Team_6 on Friday. Team_1 will aim to follow suit as they look to launch their title challenge against the side that ended their pursuit last season.\nTeam_1 (4-3-3):\xa0Aaron Ramsdale; Thomas Partey, Ben White, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli.\nSUBS: Karl Hein, Gabriel Magalhaes, Emile Smith Rowe, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson.\nTeam_16 (3-4-3): Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall, Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Ryan Yates, Orel Mangala, Ola Aina; Danilo, Brennan Johnson, Morgan Gibbs-White.\nSUBS: Ethan Horvath, Neco Williams, Cheikhou Kouyate, Taiwo Awoniyi, Chris Wood, Moussa Niakhite, Anthony Elanga, Remo Freuler, Lewis O'Brien.\nMikel Arteta makes just a single change from last weekend's Community Shield victory - albeit a hugely intriguing one with Nketiah replacing Gabriel, who drops to the bench. In a subsequent tactical reshuffle, White moves across into the heart of defence with Thomas starting at right-back. Havertz moves into an attacking three-man midfield alongside Odegaard and Rice, with Nketiah leading the line.\nMeanwhile, Matt Turner starts in goal in the week he joined Forest from Team_1. The former Gunner is one of two new signings named in Steve Cooper's starting line-up along with Aina, who joined on a free transfer. Interestingly, there is no place for Awoniyi, who enjoyed a strong finish to last season - scoring the winner against Team_1 in May.\nIt is not the first time the two sides are meeting on the opening weekend of a Premier League season. Indeed, they did the same a quarter of a century ago, Marc Overmars scoring the winner as Team_1 prevailed 2-1 at Highbury.\nKick-off has been delayed by 30 minutes due to an issue at the turnstiles. Stay tuned for further updates.\nThe stadium is gradually filling up with plenty of fans now taking their seats. We should not be too far from starting here.\nLater than planned, but the players are finally making their way out onto the field. Kick-off at the Emirates is moments away.\nMichael Oliver is today's referee. He blows his whistle and Forest get the match under way.\nBoth sides will be looking to address their respective form from last season. Team_1 kept just four Premier League clean sheets on home soil, while Forest had the worst away record in the division - winning just one of 19 matches and registered just eight points.\nTeam_1 quickly settling into their rhythm and Saka earns a corner via Aina's deflection. But Forest deal with two deliveries into their box.\nThe Gunners are unbeaten in each of their last nine home league meetings with Forest, winning five and drawing four.\nSaka cuts inside from the right wing and seeks out Nketiah with a clever reverse pass. However, it is just lacking the required accuracy and Turner comes out to collect.\nToday, Forest are aiming to end a run of four successive opening-day defeats. Although, the start to the game suggests they face a tough task in breaking the streak.\nCHANCE! Johnson must do better! Against the run of play, Forest are in behind Team_1, who went to sleep at the back. Johnson is all on his own as he latches onto Boly's header and beats Ramsdale, but cannot keep his shot on target.\nAt the other end, Odegaard threads a neat throughball looking for Nketiah. Turner is quickly out to smother the ball, though the Team_1 forward is subsequently ruled offside.\nForest's lacking of a clinical edge was evident with that Johnson opportunity going begging. They only scored three times during pre-season and failed to find the net in each of their final four warm-up matches.\nTeam_1 continuing to enjoy most of the possession in their opening match of the season. But the Gunners must look to record more attempts on goal.\nWe are still goalless inside the opening 20 minutes at the Emirates, where Team_1 have fond memories of their last two meetings with Forest. Indeed, both culminated in commanding 5-0 victories for the Gunners. More of the same today would do very nicely for the hosts.\nAn anxious moment for Forest as Turner's attempted clearance is charged down by Nketiah. Thankfully for the visitors, the ball ricochets well wide of the target, but their hearts will have momentarily been in their mouths.\nForest are trying to gain a foothold in the contest having enjoyed just over 13 per cent of the possession so far.

93495	Luton	Newcastle	2023-12-23	Kenilworth Road, Luton	11042.0	Darren England	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Arsenal and Brighton at the Emirates Stadium.
The hosts have enjoyed another excellent start to the season, though the memories of Manchester City pipping them to the title last term will still be haunting them. Results like the 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa last time out in the Premier League will not help the nerves, as will the strong form of current leaders Liverpool. A win here will see the Gunners move top, temporarily at least ahead of Liverpool's game with Manchester United later on Sunday.
Brighton started the campaign in brilliant fashion, winning five of their first six Premier League matches. However, a barren six-game spell that saw the Seagulls go over two months without a league victory took the momentum out of their fight for the European spots. Roberto De Zerbi's men have won two of their last four in the league, though, and Brighton fans will be hoping they can once again find the momentum they had at the start of the season.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBS: Reiss Nelson, Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe, Aaron Ramsdale, Jakub Kiwior, Cedric Soares, Leandro Trossard, Myles Anthony Lewis-Skelly, Reuell Walters.
BRIGHTON (4-2-3-1): Bart Verbruggen; Joel Veltman, Jan-Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, James Milner; Pascal Gross, Billy Gilmour; Simon Adingra, Adam Lallana, Kaoru Mitoma; Evan Ferguson.
SUBS: Facundo Buonanotte, Danny Welbeck, Igor, Jason Steele, Carlos Balepa, Mahmoud Dahoud, Jack Hinshelwood, Joao Pedro, Jakub Moder.
After ringing the changes for the dead rubber Champions League clash against PSV during midweek, Arteta reverts to the same starting XI that lost at Villa Park last weekend. Jorginho is a notable absence from the squad, though Smith Rowe is fit enough to make the bench after making his return from injury off the bench against PSV.
De Zerbi makes three alterations from the 1-1 home draw with Burnley last weekend as Mitoma, Veltman and Gilmour come in for Pedro, Dahoud and Baleba. Welbeck, who played for Arsenal between 2014 and 2019, will look to haunt his former side off the bench if he is called upon.
The two teams enter the pitch at the Emirates Stadium ahead of this big game in the Premier League. Can Arsenal get back to winning ways? We will find out shortly!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way in North London!
It has been a very bright start from Arsenal, who are looking to pin back Brighton and find an early goal. It's vital De Zerbi's men make it through these early stages without conceding.
Arsenal have lost their last three home games against Brighton in all competitions – only against Manchester City (seven between 2018 and 2023) have they lost more consecutively at the Emirates Stadium.
Van Hecke and Dunk have already been busy, tasked with dealing with a couple of wicked crosses into their penalty area. They will need to play well if the Seagulls are to come away with a result.
Ten minutes on the clock at the Emirates Stadium, and while Arsenal have shaded the opening exchanges, they are yet to really carve open this Brighton defence. Arteta will be wanting the likes of Saka and Martinelli to run at their full-backs to try and create something.
The first shot on target falls to Saka as he cuts in and fires, though his effort is tame and straight down the throat of Verbruggen, who makes a comfortable save.
Arsenal threaten again as clever link-up play between Rice and Saka gives the latter the ball in a dangerous position, though his shot is blocked by a well-placed Dunk.
WIDE! Odegaard cuts in from the right onto his favoured left foot and makes the space for a shot. His curling effort looks to be bending into the far corner, though the ball ends up flying just wide of the left post. That is the closest the Gunners have come so far.
Milner is perhaps lucky to avoid a booking after wiping out Saka near the touchline. The challenge was very late, and you suspect the veteran would have seen yellow had there been more minutes on the clock.
46.4 per cent of the action was in the Brighton third over the opening 15 minutes. It has been a dominant performance from Arsenal in terms of territory, though the scoreline remains 0-0.
Jesus makes the space for a shot from range after shifting onto his right foot and firing, but his effort is poor and straight at Verbruggen.
De Zerbi may be forced into an early change here as Veltman goes down with a problem. Hinshelwood is a potential option off the bench if Veltman does have to come off.
It appears Veltman will try and soldier on. Arteta will be instructing Martinelli to have a run at the defender to take advantage of any potential discomfort Veltman is in.
Gabriel gets up brilliantly to leap above Milner and meet a delivery from the left, though his header fails to trouble Verbruggen as he makes another routine stop.
Veltman goes down again and it appears his race is finally run. He did try and battle on, but against a side the calibre of Arsenal, that may not have proved too helpful to his side's efforts.
Veltman does indeed limp off, and 18-year-old Hinshelwood is on in his place.
Brighton have won four of their seven away games against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium – it’s the highest win rate (57 per cent) of any visiting English side at the ground since it opened in 2006.
Martinelli whips a teasing ball across the face of goal, but Dunk coolly chests it back to his goalkeeper before any lurking Arsenal forward can get there. That was cool as you like from the centre-back.
A big opportunity goes begging for Arsenal as Odegaard plays a delightful pass in behind the Brighton defence for Saka. The England international cuts the ball back for Martinelli, only for the left winger to lash high and wide of the target.
The home side has won just two of the last 10 Premier League meetings between Arsenal and Brighton (three draws, five defeats), with the Seagulls winning 2-1 at Amex Stadium in June 2020, and Arsenal winning 2-0 at the Emirates in May 2021.
Zinchenko wins a foul after being brought down by Adingra, but the Arsenal man's attempts to play a quick free-kick are brought back by the referee, much to the home crowd's frustration.
White receives the first yellow card of the contest after cynically halting the progress of Mitoma down the Brighton left as the Seagulls looked to counter.
Brighton hearts are in mouths again as Martinelli gets to the byline before trying to cross. Verbruggen diverts the ball back into the danger area, but a couple of his defenders converge to block Havertz's shot.
Brighton are yet to record a shot in this game. It's been all one-way traffic, yet the scoreline remains goalless as we close in on half-time.
Mitoma drags back Saka and receives a booking for his troubles. Arteta also receives a yellow card for his protestations on the sidelines.
The fourth official puts up his board and indicates there will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
It has been a very frustrating first half for the Gunners, who just cannot quite seem to find a way through this resilient Brighton defence.
Saka pounces upon a loose ball in the Brighton defence before racing into the box and firing, though his effort is always rising and flies high over the crossbar.
HALF-TIME: ARSENAL 0-0 BRIGHTON
The half-time whistle blows as the teams head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 0-0 at the Emirates Stadium. It was a first half dominated by Arsenal, holding the majority of the possession and going close through the likes of Odegaard and Martinelli. Verbruggen has been busy between the Brighton sticks, but his work and some wasteful Arsenal finishing ensure we go to the break goalless.
Brighton are yet to record a shot, but their rearguard action has largely kept Arsenal at bay. There is a long time to go, however, and De Zerbi will be wanting more of an attacking threat to get his side up the pitch and stop the wave after wave of Arsenal attacks that we saw for spells in the first half.
The hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half. Can they find a way through this Brighton defence over the next 45 minutes?
Arsenal have now stopped the opposition from scoring a first-half goal in 11 of their 17 games. No team has done this more in the Premier League this season.
For the first time in 49 Premier League games under De Zerbi, Brighton didn't attempt a single shot in the first half.
A loose pass by Verbruggen inexplicably gives the ball away in a terrible area. Rice gets it to Saka, who then squares it to Odegaard. However, the Arsenal captain cannot quite get his feet sorted in time and Van Hecke gets across to make a vital block.
GOOOAAALLL!!! JESUS PUTS ARSENAL AHEAD!!! For all of Brighton's strong defending, the manner in which they have gone behind will frustrate De Zerbi no end. Van Hecke gets up to meet Saka's inswinging corner delivery. However, he can only nod the ball on towards the back post, where an unmarked Jesus is waiting to head into the back of the net and put the Gunners 1-0 up!
Having just got their noses in front, the hosts are looking for a quick second to tighten their grip on this contest. It's vital Brighton make it through the next period of the game just the one goal behind.
Arsenal have a record of 10 wins, one draw and no defeats when scoring the opening goal in the Premier League this season. They usually go on and take maximum points when they get ahead in games.
Having taken the lead via a corner, no team has scored more goals from set-pieces (excluding penalties) in the Premier League this season than Arsenal (10 - level with Everton).
De Zerbi responds to going behind with a trio of substitutions. The first sees Lallana make way for Buonanotte.
Ferguson struggled to make an impact during his time on the field, and he is replaced by Pedro up top.
De Zerbi also brings on Igor for Milner in defence.
What impact will those Brighton changes have? There is plenty of time here, but the visitors will have to conjure up more of a threat going forward.
Brighton's first shot of the game falls the way of Hinshelwood, but his header from a cross is straight at Raya. That will provide a bit of encouragement, however, that the visitors can go and find a way back into this contest.
Buonanotte momentarily goes down in midfield after a coming-together with Saliba. The Arsenal man gets the ball, but the follow-through seems to have caught Buonanotte on the ankle.
CLOSE! White flicks on a Martinelli corner at the near post, and the ball looks to be flying in. However, Dunk somehow gets back in the nick of time to make a crucial last-ditch intervention, nodding the ball over his own crossbar. That was a goal-saving header from the Brighton captain.
Brighton's substitutes have scored more goals (10) and have more goal involvements (13) than those of any other team in the Premier League this season. Can De Zerbi's introductions make an impact again over these final 20 minutes?
There are some faint appeals for a penalty from the Brighton fans as Mitoma goes down under White's challenge, but the protests are half-hearted at best and the referee waves play on.
SAVE! Verbruggen keeps the deficit at just the one with a vital stop. Arsenal catch Brighton on the counter and the ball ends up with Odegaard. He holds off a couple of Brighton defenders to get a shot away, but Verbruggen does well to parry it behind for a corner.
CHANCE! Arsenal will kick themselves if they do not go on to win this game. This time, it's Havertz who gets on the end of Martinelli's cross from the left, only to head over the crossbar from close range.
Gilmour goes in the book for a crunching challenge on Jesus in midfield.
De Zerbi's changes have had little impact so far. Arsenal have continued to dominate, but as long as the lead is just the one goal, the home crowd could be in for a nervy final 12 or so minutes.
Welbeck comes on to a warm reception from both sets of fans. Adingra is the man to make way.
Arteta makes his first changes of the game. Jesus, whose goal could prove to be the winner, trudges off for Nketiah.
Trossard also enters the fray, coming on for Martinelli on the Gunners' left wing.
WHAT A CHANCE!!! Brighton have barely had a kick going forward, but they really should be level! Pedro slides a neat pass down the left for Mitoma, who fires a cross into the box. Gross is there in the middle, and it looks for all the world like he will turn home for a Seagulls equaliser. However, he somehow manages to shoot the wrong side of the post! What a let-off for Arsenal!
Another chance to put the game to bed goes begging for Arsenal as a marauding run from Rice takes him all the way into the Brighton box. He bursts past Van Hecke before firing goalwards, but Verbruggen is able to block the midfielder's effort.
Hinshelwood gets up well to meet Gross' delivery from the left, but the youngster doesn't get the contact he wants on the ball and it ends up bouncing harmlessly wide.
GOOOAAALLL!!! GAME OVER!!! Havertz surely makes the points safe with a fine finish! A sweeping Arsenal counter sees Odegaard find Nketiah. With options to his left and right, Nketiah picks the right one by sliding the ball into the path of Havertz. The Germany international strides towards goal before dinking over the goalkeeper and in to make it 2-0 to Arsenal!
Nketiah's pass was superb to allow Havertz to potentially put the game to bed.
Having just put his team two goals to the good, Havertz is replaced by the returning Smith Rowe.
With the game surely won, Saka is taken off for Nelson.
Gross is booked for dissent. This has been a frustrating outing for the Seagulls.
We are into six minutes of additional time at the end of this match. A Brighton comeback looks unlikely now.
Smith Rowe nearly marks his return from injury with a goal as he fires Trossard's cutback goalwards, only for Verbruggen to make the save.
Kiwior comes on for the final stages, with Zinchenko the man to make way.
Arsenal have now scored 11 goals in the last 15 minutes of the second half. Only Liverpool (14) have scored more during that period in the Premier League this season.
FULL-TIME: ARSENAL 2-0 BRIGHTON
The full-time whistle blows as Arsenal celebrate a comfortable 2-0 win against Brighton at the Emirates Stadium. It was a frustrating first half for the Gunners, who dominated the possession and territory without finding a way through the Seagulls defence. That changed not long after the interval, however, as Van Hecke failed to deal with a Saka corner, allowing Jesus to nod home at the near post. Havertz then made the points safe in the latter stages, firing home after Nketiah's clever throughball had played him in to put the result beyond doubt. The win moves Arsenal top, temporarily at least ahead of Liverpool's game with Manchester United at Anfield later on Sunday. For Brighton, this loss and West Ham's win against Wolves means they drop to ninth. They will look to get back on track away at Crystal Palace on Thursday, while the Gunners will look to land a huge blow in the title race when they take on Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. That is all we have from the Emirates Stadium, so thanks for your company and goodbye!"	"Andros Townsend scored his first goal for Luton Town against his former club Newcastle United as the Hatters won 1-0 at Kenilworth Road to move two points from safety.
Townsend headed in at close range in the 25th minute, celebrating with a tribute to captain Tom Lockyer, and Luton then kept their first clean sheet of the season to secure a vital victory.
Before the match, both sets of fans unveiled banners in support of Luton captain Lockyer, who suffered a cardiac arrest in their fixture against AFC Bournemouth last Saturday, which was abandoned. There was also a minute of applause for the player and those who helped him in the fourth minute.
Although Luton started on the front foot, they had to make three blocks in quick succession to stop Newcastle from scoring in the 14th minute.
Thomas Kaminski then produced a brilliant reflex save five minutes later to deny Callum Wilson’s header from close range.
Newcastle were made to pay for their missed chances when their former player Townsend gave Luton the lead in the 25th minute. Barkley flicked the ball on from Alfie Doughty’s corner and Townsend was unmarked at the back post to head home.
Barkley came close to doubling Luton’s lead with a thunderous strike from distance in the 33rd minute, but the ball crashed off the crossbar and into the control of Martin Dubravka.
The Newcastle ‘keeper then made a crucial save just two minutes later with his foot to keep out Elijah Adebayo after Barkley played him through on goal with a great pass.
Eddie Howe’s injury list continued to grow as Newcastle captain Jamaal Lascelles was forced off the pitch before the break.
Luton hit the crossbar for the second time in the match just three minutes into the second half as Jacob Brown’s effort cannoned off the woodwork.
Bruno Guimaraes missed a huge chance for Newcastle two minutes later after he fired wide from a well-worked corner routine.
The visitors had the ball in the back of the net just after the hour-mark through substitute Alexander Isak, but the goal was ruled out for offside.
Newcastle piled on the pressure in the closing stages in search of a late equaliser, but they were unable to find a way past Kaminski.
Luton remain in 18th place on 12 points while Newcastle are now in seventh on 29 points.

Team_15	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_1 and Team_5 at the Emirates Stadium.\nThe hosts have enjoyed another excellent start to the season, though the memories of Team_13 pipping them to the title last term will still be haunting them. Results like the 1-0 defeat at Team_2 last time out in the Premier League will not help the nerves, as will the strong form of current leaders Team_11. A win here will see the Gunners move top, temporarily at least ahead of Team_11 game with Team_14 later on Sunday.\nTeam_5 started the campaign in brilliant fashion, winning five of their first six Premier League matches. However, a barren six-game spell that saw the Seagulls go over two months without a league victory took the momentum out of their fight for the European spots. Roberto De Zerbi's men have won two of their last four in the league, though, and Team_5 fans will be hoping they can once again find the momentum they had at the start of the season.\nTeam_1 (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.\nSUBS: Reiss Nelson, Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe, Aaron Ramsdale, Jakub Kiwior, Cedric Soares, Leandro Trossard, Myles Anthony Lewis-Skelly, Reuell Walters.\nTeam_5 (4-2-3-1): Bart Verbruggen; Joel Veltman, Jan-Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, James Milner; Pascal Gross, Billy Gilmour; Simon Adingra, Adam Lallana, Kaoru Mitoma; Evan Ferguson.\nSUBS: Facundo Buonanotte, Danny Welbeck, Igor, Jason Steele, Carlos Balepa, Mahmoud Dahoud, Jack Hinshelwood, Joao Pedro, Jakub Moder.\nAfter ringing the changes for the dead rubber Champions League clash against PSV during midweek, Arteta reverts to the same starting XI that lost at Villa Park last weekend. Jorginho is a notable absence from the squad, though Smith Rowe is fit enough to make the bench after making his return from injury off the bench against PSV.\nDe Zerbi makes three alterations from the 1-1 home draw with Team_6 last weekend as Mitoma, Veltman and Gilmour come in for Pedro, Dahoud and Baleba. Welbeck, who played for Team_1 between 2014 and 2019, will look to haunt his former side off the bench if he is called upon.\nThe two teams enter the pitch at the Emirates Stadium ahead of this big game in the Premier League. Can Team_1 get back to winning ways? We will find out shortly!\nThe visitors kick us off and we are under way in North London!\nIt has been a very bright start from Team_1, who are looking to pin back Team_5 and find an early goal. It's vital De Zerbi's men make it through these early stages without conceding.\nTeam_1 have lost their last three home games against Team_5 in all competitions – only against Team_13 (seven between 2018 and 2023) have they lost more consecutively at the Emirates Stadium.\nVan Hecke and Dunk have already been busy, tasked with dealing with a couple of wicked crosses into their penalty area. They will need to play well if the Seagulls are to come away with a result.\nTen minutes on the clock at the Emirates Stadium, and while Team_1 have shaded the opening exchanges, they are yet to really carve open this Team_5 defence. Arteta will be wanting the likes of Saka and Martinelli to run at their full-backs to try and create something.\nThe first shot on target falls to Saka as he cuts in and fires, though his effort is tame and straight down the throat of Verbruggen, who makes a comfortable save.\nTeam_1 threaten again as clever link-up play between Rice and Saka gives the latter the ball in a dangerous position, though his shot is blocked by a well-placed Dunk.\nWIDE! Odegaard cuts in from the right onto his favoured left foot and makes the space for a shot. His curling effort looks to be bending into the far corner, though the ball ends up flying just wide of the left post. That is the closest the Gunners have come so far.\nMilner is perhaps lucky to avoid a booking after wiping out Saka near the touchline. The challenge was very late, and you suspect the veteran would have seen yellow had there been more minutes on the clock.\n46.4 per cent of the action was in the Team_5 third over the opening 15 minutes. It has been a dominant performance from Team_1 in terms of territory, though the scoreline remains 0-0.\nJesus makes the space for a shot from range after shifting onto his right foot and firing, but his effort is poor and straight at Verbruggen.\nDe Zerbi may be forced into an early change here as Veltman goes down with a problem. Hinshelwood is a potential option off the bench if Veltman does have to come off.\nIt appears Veltman will try and soldier on. Arteta will be instructing Martinelli to have a run at the defender to take advantage of any potential discomfort Veltman is in.\nGabriel gets up brilliantly to leap above Milner and meet a delivery from the left, though his header fails to trouble Verbruggen as he makes another routine stop.\nVeltman goes down again and it appears his race is finally run. He did try and battle on, but against a side the calibre of Team_1, that may not have proved too helpful to his side's efforts.\nVeltman does indeed limp off, and 18-year-old Hinshelwood is on in his place.\nTeam_5 have won four of their seven away games against Team_1 at the Emirates Stadium – it’s the highest win rate (57 per cent) of any visiting English side at the ground since it opened in 2006.\nMartinelli whips a teasing ball across the face of goal, but Dunk coolly chests it back to his goalkeeper before any lurking Team_1 forward can get there. That was cool as you like from the centre-back.\nA big opportunity goes begging for Team_1 as Odegaard plays a delightful pass in behind the Team_5 defence for Saka. The England international cuts the ball back for Martinelli, only for the left winger to lash high and wide of the target.\nThe home side has won just two of the last 10 Premier League meetings between Team_1 and Team_5 (three draws, five defeats), with the Seagulls winning 2-1 at Amex Stadium in June 2020, and Team_1 winning 2-0 at the Emirates in May 2021.\nZinchenko wins a foul after being brought down by Adingra, but the Team_1 man's attempts to play a quick free-kick are brought back by the referee, much to the home crowd's frustration.\nWhite receives the first yellow card of the contest after cynically halting the progress of Mitoma down the Team_5 left as the Seagulls looked to counter.\nTeam_5 hearts are in mouths again as Martinelli gets to the byline before trying to cross. Verbruggen diverts the ball back into the danger area, but a couple of his defenders converge to block Havertz's shot.\nTeam_5 are yet to record a shot in this game. It's been all one-way traffic, yet the scoreline remains goalless as we close in on half-time.\nMitoma drags back Saka and receives a booking for his troubles. Arteta also receives a yellow card for his protestations on the sidelines.\nThe fourth official puts up his board and indicates there will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.\nIt has been a very frustrating first half for the Gunners, who just cannot quite seem to find a way through this resilient Team_5 defence.\nSaka pounces upon a loose ball in the Team_5 defence before racing into the box and firing, though his effort is always rising and flies high over the crossbar.\nHALF-TIME: Team_1 0-0 Team_5\nThe half-time whistle blows as the teams head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 0-0 at the Emirates Stadium. It was a first half dominated by Team_1, holding the majority of the possession and going close through the likes of Odegaard and Martinelli. Verbruggen has been busy between the Team_5 sticks, but his work and some wasteful Team_1 finishing ensure\xa0we go to the break goalless.\nTeam_5 are yet to record a shot, but their rearguard action has largely kept Team_1 at bay. There is a long time to go, however, and De Zerbi will be wanting more of an attacking threat to get his side up the pitch and stop the wave after wave of Team_1 attacks that we saw for spells in the first half.\nThe hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half. Can they find a way through this Team_5 defence over the next 45 minutes?\nTeam_1 have now stopped the opposition from scoring a first-half goal in 11 of their 17 games. No team has done this more in the Premier League this season.\nFor the first time in 49 Premier League games under De Zerbi, Team_5 didn't attempt a single shot in the first half.\nA loose pass by Verbruggen inexplicably gives the ball away in a terrible area. Rice gets it to Saka, who then squares it to Odegaard. However, the Team_1 captain cannot quite get his feet sorted in time and Van Hecke gets across to make a vital block.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! JESUS PUTS Team_1 AHEAD!!! For all of Team_5 strong defending, the manner in which they have gone behind will frustrate De Zerbi no end. Van Hecke gets up to meet Saka's inswinging corner delivery. However, he can only nod the ball on towards the back post, where an unmarked Jesus is waiting to head into the back of the net and put the Gunners 1-0 up!\nHaving just got their noses in front, the hosts are looking for a quick second to tighten their grip on this contest. It's vital Team_5 make it through the next period of the game just the one goal behind.\nTeam_1 have a record of 10 wins, one draw and no defeats when scoring the opening goal in the Premier League this season. They usually go on and take maximum points when they get ahead in games.\nHaving taken the lead via a corner, no team has scored more goals from set-pieces (excluding penalties) in the Premier League this season than Team_1 (10 - level with Team_9).\nDe Zerbi responds to going behind with a trio of substitutions. The first sees Lallana make way for Buonanotte.\nFerguson struggled to make an impact during his time on the field, and he is replaced by Pedro up top.\nDe Zerbi also brings on Igor for Milner in defence.\nWhat impact will those Team_5 changes have? There is plenty of time here, but the visitors will have to conjure up more of a threat going forward.\nTeam_5 first shot of the game falls the way of Hinshelwood, but his header from a cross is straight at Raya. That will provide a bit of encouragement, however, that the visitors can go and find a way back into this contest.\nBuonanotte momentarily goes down in midfield after a coming-together with Saliba. The Team_1 man gets the ball, but the follow-through seems to have caught Buonanotte on the ankle.\nCLOSE! White flicks on a Martinelli corner at the near post, and the ball looks to be flying in. However, Dunk somehow gets back in the nick of time to make a crucial last-ditch intervention, nodding the ball over his own crossbar. That was a goal-saving header from the Team_5 captain.\nTeam_5 substitutes have scored more goals (10) and have more goal involvements (13) than those of any other team in the Premier League this season. Can De Zerbi's introductions make an impact again over these final 20 minutes?\nThere are some faint appeals for a penalty from the Team_5 fans as Mitoma goes down under White's challenge, but the protests are half-hearted at best and the referee waves play on.\nSAVE! Verbruggen keeps the deficit at just the one with a vital stop. Team_1 catch Team_5 on the counter and the ball ends up with Odegaard. He holds off a couple of Team_5 defenders to get a shot away, but Verbruggen does well to parry it behind for a corner.\nCHANCE! Team_1 will kick themselves if they do not go on to win this game. This time, it's Havertz who gets on the end of Martinelli's cross from the left, only to head over the crossbar from close range.\nGilmour goes in the book for a crunching challenge on Jesus in midfield.\nDe Zerbi's changes have had little impact so far. Team_1 have continued to dominate, but as long as the lead is just the one goal, the home crowd could be in for a nervy final 12 or so minutes.\nWelbeck comes on to a warm reception from both sets of fans.

93384	Fulham	Chelsea	2023-10-02	Craven Cottage, London	24445.0	Tim Robinson	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between West Ham and Manchester City.
The London Stadium plays host to two sides protecting unbeaten starts to the Premier League season. Man City have won all four of their matches, while West Ham have won three and drawn one of their four games so far.
WEST HAM (4-1-4-1): Alphonse Areola; Vladimir Coufal, Kurt Zouma, Nayef Aguerd, Emerson; Edson Alvarez; Jarrod Bowen, Tomas Soucek, James Ward-Prowse, Lucas Paqueta; Michail Antonio.
SUBS: Lukasz Fabianski, Aaron Cresswell, Pablo Fornals, Mohammed Kudus, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Danny Ings, Angelo Ogbonna, Said Benrahma, Thilo Kehrer.
MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri, Phil Foden; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Jeremy Doku; Erling Haaland.
SUBS: Stefan Ortega, Scott Carson, Kalvin Phillips, Nathan Ake, Sergio Gomez, Matheus Nunes, Oscar Bobb, Rico Lewis.
David Moyes makes a single change from West Ham's win over Luton Town last time out. Soucek is back after concussion to replace Benrahma, who drops to the bench, while Ward-Prowse and Coufal also start. Mavropanos could make his debut as a substitute.
Meanwhile, Pep Guardiola makes two changes from the win over Fulham. Gvardiol and Silva are in for Ake and Kovacic, who joins Kevin De Bruyne, John Stones and Jack Grealish in the treatment room. New signing Nunes could make his debut from the bench.
City are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League meetings with West Ham. The Hammers' only longer streak without victory was a 16-match spell against Manchester United between 1993 and 2001.
The teams make their way out onto the pitch and kick-off is fast approaching at the London Stadium.
The referee blows his whistle and City get us under way.
The reigning champions go straight onto the attack with some neat link-up play down the right. Walker finds Foden, who centres the ball, but it ricochets kindly into Areola's arms.
Good defending! Walker shows great vision to pick out Haaland, who looks to slip the ball through for Foden. But Coufal tracks his run well and makes an important sliding intervention.
City continue to ask questions of the West Ham defence. Doku gets away from Coufal and crosses, but Zouma is well-placed to head clear.
GREAT SAVES! Areola twice comes to West Ham's rescue! Foden's corner finds Rodri, whose powerful header is beaten away by Areola. A follow-up shot from Haaland is then cleared off the line, before the goalkeeper denies Dias from point-blank range.
West Ham did well to somehow survive that City corner. The hosts have Areola to thank, but Soucek was also alert in clearing off the line.
The Hammers are enjoying their joint-best start to a Premier League season, having also collected 10 points from their opening four games under Harry Redknapp back in 1999-2000.
It is great to see Guardiola back on the City bench today after his recent back operation. The Spaniard has never lost against West Ham in the Premier League.
HAALAND MISSES! He is human, you know! Doku teases defenders before slipping the ball through for Gvardiol, who drills it across the face of goal. Haaland is unmarked at the far post, but can only steer the ball wide from inside the six-yard box.
AGUERD SHOULD SCORE! West Ham force their first corner of the game. Bowen's delivery is flicked on at the near post by Soucek, but Aguerd cannot react quickly enough to apply the finishing touch in the six-yard box.
Doku has been lively so far. Receiving a diagonal ball from Akanji, he teases Coufal once more. The winger then goes for goal from a tight angle, but his shot is straight at Areola.
West Ham have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 Premier League matches against the reigning champions. But the hosts have maintained their concentration levels so far to keep City at bay.
Foden receives the ball on the edge of the box and gets a shot away, but Zouma is well-placed to deflect it wide for a corner.
City are unbeaten in eight Premier League away games against West Ham, scoring 24 goals along the way and conceding just six.
West Ham threaten and Antonio is found, but Akanji shows great strength to dispossess the Hammers forward.
Sarcastic cheers echo around the London Stadium as Foden's attempted corner curls out of play. West Ham can relax for a moment with a goal-kick.
Rodri skips away from Edson Alvarez and shoots from the edge of the box. It is a clean strike, but straight at Areola.
City have dominated proceedings so far with over 70 per cent of the possession. But the visitors are still in search of the breakthrough.
There is a break in play as Antonio and Dias stay down following an aerial collision. But after taking a moment to gather themselves, both players are soon back on their feet.
Moyes does not boast a great record against City in recent times. The Scot claimed 40 of a possible 66 Premier League points from the Citizens during his time at Everton, but has won just two from 39 since then.
WARD-PROWSE!!! 1-0 WEST HAM! The hosts lead against the run of play! West Ham quickly break as Coufal exchanges passes with Bowen and gets away down the right. The full-back then provides a brilliant cross to the far post, where the unmarked Ward-Prowse buries a header.
Dispossessing Doku, Coufal burst into the action with a neat one-two with Bowen, before his delicious cross was headed home by Ward-Prowse.
Opening the scoring, Ward-Prowse has now been directly involved in a goal in each of his last six Premier League appearances. That is his best such streak in the English top flight.
Edson Alvarez throws the ball away to prevent City from taking a quick free-kick, and is booked.
There is a long way to go yet at the London Stadium. But as things stand, West Ham would leapfrog City to second place in the Premier League table.
OFF THE LINE! West Ham somehow survive! Once again, Doku teases Coufal and sends a low cross towards the far post. Haaland is unmarked and turns the ball towards goal, but Aguerd is alert to prevent it from creeping over the line.
City continue to seek the equaliser. Rodri lets fly from distance with a fierce effort that whistles fractionally wide of the target.
We are into the first of two additional minutes at the end of this first half. The visitors keep threatening, but West Ham remain stubborn.
Gvardiol catches Bowen late and has his name taken.
HALF-TIME: WEST HAM 1-0 MANCHESTER CITY
West Ham lead Manchester City 1-0 at the break. Although on the back foot for most of the first half, the Hammers broke the deadlock in the 36th minute with James Ward-Prowse heading home Vladimir Coufal's cross to continue his rich vein of form.
City trail at the London Stadium despite enjoying 64.1 per cent of the possession during the first half, while also registering 17 shots on goal to their opponents' three.
We are off and running again at the London Stadium.
DOKU!!! 1-1! CITY ARE LEVEL! After a brilliant first half, Doku makes a superb start to the second. Found by Julian Alvarez, he cuts inside and into the area before sweeping the ball into the far corner.
Julian Alvarez marauded forward into the West Ham half and played the ball out to Doku, who did the rest in sublime fashion.
What a start to the second half by City! The words of Guardiola are clearly still ringing in their ears. They are looking incredibly purposeful here.
City force a corner after Foden's shot deflects wide. The subsequent delivery eventually drops to Gvardiol, who cannot keep his volley down.
The visitors have a free-kick in a dangerous position after Edson Alvarez upends Rodri. This is a decent opportunity to turn the contest on its head.
OFF THE POST! The woodwork denies City! Julian Alvarez steps up and whips a wonderful effort towards the near corner, only to see his attempt crash against the post.
WHAT A SAVE! Areola denies Haaland! Rodri intercepts possession and drives forward before scooping the ball over the top of the defence for Haaland, whose acrobatic volley is beaten away by Areola.
Still, the goal eludes Haaland today. City's number nine has now had six shots on goal - more than any other player - without success. But he will continue to plug away.
West Ham turn defence into attack with Paqueta sending Antonio on his way. However, the latter's touch is too heavy and Ederson is quickly out to deny him.
City attack down the other end and Rodri tries his luck from distance. But his left-footed effort is high and wide of the target.
CHANCE! Silva whips a delicious ball into the box. Haaland attacks it, but can only head straight at Areola.
Great challenge! Emerson leads West Ham's charge with a powerful run into the heart of the City defence. But Akanji denies him a shot on goal with a brilliantly timed sliding tackle.
GOOD SAVE! Ward-Prowse's corner is met by Zouma, whose powerful header is well kept out by Ederson.
This is a thoroughly entertaining contest at the London Stadium. Both sides are providing plenty of attacking threat as they go in search of the game's third goal.
GOOD SAVE! Space opens for Gvardiol to let fly from distance. The full-back's effort takes a slight deflection, but Areola tracks the ball well and pushes it away.
Moyes is going to make a change. Kudus is introduced for the hosts with Antonio making way.
City make a change as well. Nunes comes on for his debut in place of Foden.
Benrahma also replaces Edson Alvarez, who is unable to continue after picking up a knock.
We are approaching the final 20 minutes at the London Stadium. Can either side find a winning goal, or are we set for a stalemate?
West Ham last beat City in the Premier League in September 2015. The Hammers have every chance of ending that wait here, but must maintain their performance levels.
The Hammers look to threaten down the left flank with Benrahma leading the charge. But Walker tracks him all the way and eventually snuffs out the danger.
SILVA!!! 2-1 CITY! The turnaround is complete! After Nunes' cross is cleared, City maintain the pressure. Silva latches onto Julian Alvarez's scooped pass, before clipping the ball beyond Areola.
Julian Alvarez provided the assist with a delightful lofted ball over the top of the West Ham defence.
The reigning champions hit the front at the London Stadium. It has been quite a battle for Guardiola's side today, but they have eventually edged their noses ahead.
Soucek is late on Akanji and goes into the book.
GREAT SAVE! Walker demonstrates his incredible pace as he beats Zouma to Silva's clever pass and bursts away down the right. He crosses for Haaland, but Areola once again denies City's number nine with tremendous reflexes.
That is now eight shots without success today for Haaland, though Areola has been in wonderful form to keep him at bay. He will keep trying, though.
HAALAND!!! 3-1 CITY! Haaland gets his goal! Silva is found by Julian Alvarez in acres of space on the right. The winger comes inside and picks out Haaland, who takes a touch before drilling past Areola.
Silva was afforded far too much space to come in from the right wing and pick out Haaland.
West Ham make two changes. One of them sees Kehrer replace Coufal.
Ings is also introduced by Moyes with Soucek making way.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try and try again! That has certainly been the case for Haaland, whose patience and persistence eventually pays dividends.
Rodri goes into the book for tripping Kudus.

FULL-TIME: WEST HAM 1-3 MANCHESTER CITY
Manchester City stay perfect and return to the top of the Premier League table after coming from behind to beat West Ham 3-1. The hosts took a first-half lead at the London Stadium through James Ward-Prowse's header. But the visitors responded as Jeremy Doku levelled within 60 seconds of the restart. Bernardo Silva then completed the turnaround in the 76th minute, before Erling Haaland sealed the points four minutes from time.
Both sides are in European action against Serbian opposition in midweek. City launch their Champions League title defence against Red Star Belgrade on Tuesday, while West Ham begin their Europa League campaign against Backa Topola two days later.
That's all for today. Thank you for joining us. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Mykhailo Mudryk's first goal for Chelsea and an Armando Broja strike in the space of 82 seconds helped secure a 2-0 victory at Fulham for the Blues' first away win of the season.
Broja, starting his first Premier League match since last November, missed a glorious chance to give Chelsea a second-minute lead.
The striker capitalised on a defensive mix-up before rounding Bernd Leno, but with only a few defenders on the line, Broja sent his effort high and wide.
That miss did not prove costly, though, as Chelsea took the lead on 18 minutes through Mudryk, who controlled Levi Colwill's pass over the top of Fulham's defence before sliding the ball through Leno's legs for his first goal for the club.
And less than two minutes later, Broja doubled Chelsea's lead.
From the kick-off, Fulham played the ball back to Tim Ream, whose pass was intercepted by Cole Palmer. The winger, making his first Premier League start for the club, then fed the ball into Broja, and despite Ream's attempted recovery clearance, the ball deflected off Broja and into the net.
The visitors nearly put the contest to bed just after the hour-mark when substitute Ian Maatsen struck a post, with the resulting effort from Enzo Fernandez being saved by Leno.
Fulham did have a great chance to reduce the deficit through substitute Sasa Lukic, but he could only shoot straight at Robert Sanchez from six yards out.
It was a deserved victory for Mauricio Pochettino's side as Chelsea move up to 11th on eight points, ahead of 13th-placed Fulham on goal difference.
Fulham report | Chelsea report
Marco Silva: ""At this level and against these types of teams, we cannot make mistakes. We were punished by the mistakes that we made. We had all the conditions to avoid that type of situation [two goals in 82 seconds]. First goal is soft, and of course, the second goal, the way we lost the ball, even our reaction - we should react much stronger. It took the confidence from us; our first half was not at a good level at all."" 
Mauricio Pochettino: ""It was important for us to build our confidence and our trust in ourselves. The performances have been very good but we didn't translate that to results; we did today, we got what we deserved. It's always important for offensive players to score goals, [Mudryk] has been doing well but unfortunately he felt something in his quad at half-time; for Broja to score too after a long time out. We need to make people believe, but when everyone is fit we are going to be so competitive.""

Team_10	Team_7	"[""Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_19 and Team_13.\nThe London Stadium plays host to two sides protecting unbeaten starts to the Premier League season. Team_13 have won all four of their matches, while Team_19 have won three and drawn one of their four games so far.\nTeam_19 (4-1-4-1): Alphonse Areola; Vladimir Coufal, Kurt Zouma, Nayef Aguerd, Emerson; Edson Alvarez; Jarrod Bowen, Tomas Soucek, James Ward-Prowse, Lucas Paqueta; Michail Antonio.\nSUBS: Lukasz Fabianski, Aaron Cresswell, Pablo Fornals, Mohammed Kudus, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Danny Ings, Angelo Ogbonna, Said Benrahma, Thilo Kehrer.\nTeam_13 (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol; Rodri, Phil Foden; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Jeremy Doku; Erling Haaland.\nSUBS: Stefan Ortega, Scott Carson, Kalvin Phillips, Nathan Ake, Sergio Gomez, Matheus Nunes, Oscar Bobb, Rico Lewis.\nDavid Moyes makes a single change from Team_19 win over Team_12 last time out. Soucek is back after concussion to replace Benrahma, who drops to the bench, while Ward-Prowse and Coufal also start. Mavropanos could make his debut as a substitute.\nMeanwhile, Pep Guardiola makes two changes from the win over Team_10. Gvardiol and Silva are in for Ake and Kovacic, who joins Kevin De Bruyne, John Stones and Jack Grealish in the treatment room. New signing Nunes could make his debut from the bench.\nCity are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League meetings with Team_19. The Hammers' only longer streak without victory was a 16-match spell against Team_14 between 1993 and 2001.\nThe teams make their way out onto the pitch and kick-off is fast approaching at the London Stadium.\nThe referee blows his whistle and City get us under way.\nThe reigning champions go straight onto the attack with some neat link-up play down the right. Walker finds Foden, who centres the ball, but it ricochets kindly into Areola's arms.\nGood defending! Walker shows great vision to pick out Haaland, who looks to slip the ball through for Foden. But Coufal tracks his run well and makes an important sliding intervention.\nCity continue to ask questions of the Team_19 defence. Doku gets away from Coufal and crosses, but Zouma is well-placed to head clear.\nGREAT SAVES! Areola twice comes to Team_19 rescue! Foden's corner finds Rodri, whose powerful header is beaten away by Areola. A follow-up shot from Haaland is then cleared off the line, before the goalkeeper denies Dias from point-blank range.\nTeam_19 did well to somehow survive that City corner. The hosts have Areola to thank, but Soucek was also alert in clearing off the line.\nThe Hammers are enjoying their joint-best start to a Premier League season, having also collected 10 points from their opening four games under Harry Redknapp back in 1999-2000.\nIt is great to see Guardiola back on the City bench today after his recent back operation. The Spaniard has never lost against Team_19 in the Premier League.\nHAALAND MISSES! He is human, you know! Doku teases defenders before slipping the ball through for Gvardiol, who drills it across the face of goal. Haaland is unmarked at the far post, but can only steer the ball wide from inside the six-yard box.\nAGUERD SHOULD SCORE! Team_19 force their first corner of the game. Bowen's delivery is flicked on at the near post by Soucek, but Aguerd cannot react quickly enough to apply the finishing touch in the six-yard box.\nDoku has been lively so far. Receiving a diagonal ball from Akanji, he teases Coufal once more. The winger then goes for goal from a tight angle, but his shot is straight at Areola.\nTeam_19 have conceded two or more goals in nine of their last 10 Premier League matches against the reigning champions. But the hosts have maintained their concentration levels so far to keep City at bay.\nFoden receives the ball on the edge of the box and gets a shot away, but Zouma is well-placed to deflect it wide for a corner.\nCity are unbeaten in eight Premier League away games against Team_19, scoring 24 goals along the way and conceding just six.\nTeam_19 threaten and Antonio is found, but Akanji shows great strength to dispossess the Hammers forward.\nSarcastic cheers echo around the London Stadium as Foden's attempted corner curls out of play. Team_19 can relax for a moment with a goal-kick.\nRodri skips away from Edson Alvarez and shoots from the edge of the box. It is a clean strike, but straight at Areola.\nCity have dominated proceedings so far with over 70 per cent of the possession. But the visitors are still in search of the breakthrough.\nThere is a break in play as Antonio and Dias stay down following an aerial collision. But after taking a moment to gather themselves, both players are soon back on their feet.\nMoyes does not boast a great record against City in recent times. The Scot claimed 40 of a possible 66 Premier League points from the Citizens during his time at Team_9, but has won just two from 39 since then.\nWARD-PROWSE!!! 1-0 Team_19! The hosts lead against the run of play! Team_19 quickly break as Coufal exchanges passes with Bowen and gets away down the right. The full-back then provides a brilliant cross to the far post, where the unmarked Ward-Prowse buries a header.\nDispossessing Doku, Coufal burst into the action with a neat one-two with Bowen, before his delicious cross was headed home by Ward-Prowse.\nOpening the scoring, Ward-Prowse has now been directly involved in a goal in each of his last six Premier League appearances. That is his best such streak in the English top flight.\nEdson Alvarez throws the ball away to prevent City from taking a quick free-kick, and is booked.\nThere is a long way to go yet at the London Stadium. But as things stand, Team_19 would leapfrog City to second place in the Premier League table.\nOFF THE LINE! Team_19 somehow survive! Once again, Doku teases Coufal and sends a low cross towards the far post. Haaland is unmarked and turns the ball towards goal, but Aguerd is alert to prevent it from creeping over the line.\nCity continue to seek the equaliser. Rodri lets fly from distance with a fierce effort that whistles fractionally wide of the target.\nWe are into the first of two additional minutes at the end of this first half. The visitors keep threatening, but Team_19 remain stubborn.\nGvardiol catches Bowen late and has his name taken.\nHALF-TIME: Team_19 1-0 Team_13\nTeam_19 lead Team_13 1-0 at the break. Although on the back foot for most of the first half, the Hammers broke the deadlock in the 36th minute with James Ward-Prowse heading home Vladimir Coufal's cross to continue his rich vein of form.\nCity trail at the London Stadium despite enjoying 64.1 per cent of the possession during the first half, while also registering 17 shots on goal to their opponents' three.\nWe are off and running again at the London Stadium.\nDOKU!!! 1-1! CITY ARE LEVEL! After a brilliant first half, Doku makes a superb start to the second. Found by Julian Alvarez, he cuts inside and into the area before sweeping the ball into the far corner.\nJulian Alvarez marauded forward into the Team_19 half and played the ball out to Doku, who did the rest in sublime fashion.\nWhat a start to the second half by City! The words of Guardiola are clearly still ringing in their ears. They are looking incredibly purposeful here.\nCity force a corner after Foden's shot deflects wide. The subsequent delivery eventually drops to Gvardiol, who cannot keep his volley down.\nThe visitors have a free-kick in a dangerous position after Edson Alvarez upends Rodri. This is a decent opportunity to turn the contest on its head.\nOFF THE POST! The woodwork denies City! Julian Alvarez steps up and whips a wonderful effort towards the near corner, only to see his attempt crash against the post.\nWHAT A SAVE! Areola denies Haaland! Rodri intercepts possession and drives forward before scooping the ball over the top of the defence for Haaland, whose acrobatic volley is beaten away by Areola.\nStill, the goal eludes Haaland today. City's number nine has now had six shots on goal - more than any other player - without success. But he will continue to plug away.\nTeam_19 turn defence into attack with Paqueta sending Antonio on his way. However, the latter's touch is too heavy and Ederson is quickly out to deny him.\nCity attack down the other end and Rodri tries his luck from distance. But his left-footed effort is high and wide of the target.\nCHANCE! Silva whips a delicious ball into the box. Haaland attacks it, but can only head straight at Areola.\nGreat challenge! Emerson leads Team_19 charge with a powerful run into the heart of the City defence. But Akanji denies him a shot on goal with a brilliantly timed sliding tackle.\nGOOD SAVE! Ward-Prowse's corner is met by Zouma, whose powerful header is well kept out by Ederson.\nThis is a thoroughly entertaining contest at the London Stadium. Both sides are providing plenty of attacking threat as they go in search of the game's third goal.\nGOOD SAVE! Space opens for Gvardiol to let fly from distance. The full-back's effort takes a slight deflection, but Areola tracks the ball well and pushes it away.\nMoyes is going to make a change. Kudus is introduced for the hosts with Antonio making way.\nCity make a change as well. Nunes comes on for his debut in place of Foden.\nBenrahma also replaces Edson Alvarez, who is unable to continue after picking up a knock.\nWe are approaching the final 20 minutes at the London Stadium. Can either side find a winning goal, or are we set for a stalemate?\nTeam_19 last beat City in the Premier League in September 2015. The Hammers have every chance of ending that wait here, but must maintain their performance levels.\nThe Hammers look to threaten down the left flank with Benrahma leading the charge. But Walker tracks him all the way and eventually snuffs out the danger.\nSILVA!!! 2-1 CITY! The turnaround is complete! After Nunes' cross is cleared, City maintain the pressure. Silva latches onto Julian Alvarez's scooped pass, before clipping the ball beyond Areola.\nJulian Alvarez provided the assist with a delightful lofted ball over the top of the Team_19 defence.\nThe reigning champions hit the front at the London Stadium. It has been quite a battle for Guardiola's side today, but they have eventually edged their noses ahead.\nSoucek is late on Akanji and goes into the book.\nGREAT SAVE! Walker demonstrates his incredible pace as he beats Zouma to Silva's clever pass and bursts away down the right. He crosses for Haaland, but Areola once again denies City's number nine with tremendous reflexes.\nThat is now eight shots without success today for Haaland, though Areola has been in wonderful form to keep him at bay. He will keep trying, though.\nHAALAND!!! 3-1 CITY! Haaland gets his goal! Silva is found by Julian Alvarez in acres of space on the right. The winger comes inside and picks out Haaland, who takes a touch before drilling past Areola.\nSilva was afforded far too much space to come in from the right wing and pick out Haaland.\nTeam_19 make two changes. One of them sees Kehrer replace Coufal.\nIngs is also introduced by Moyes with Soucek making way.\nIf at first you don't succeed, try, try and try again! That has certainly been the case for Haaland, whose patience and persistence eventually pays dividends.\nRodri goes into the book for tripping Kudus.\nDoku is given a well-earned rest as he goes off to be replaced by Gomez.\nWe are into the first of six additional minutes at the end of this game.\nCity in complete control as the clock ticks down towards what should be a fifth straight victory. The visitors neatly knock the ball around and maintain possession.\nThe visitors make a triple-change. Haaland is given a breather with Lewis coming on.\nGvardiol also makes way for City, with Ake on for the final moments.\nThe last of the changes sees Bobb replace Silva.\nPaqueta has his name taken for a trip on Bobb.\nFULL-TIME: Team_19 1-3 Team_13\nTeam_13 stay perfect and return to the top of the Premier League table after coming from behind to beat Team_19 3-1.

Both teams are seeking their first points of the season after suffering defeats on the opening weekend. Forest went down 2-1 at Arsenal while United were beaten 1-0 at home by Crystal Palace.
NOTTINGHAM FOREST (3-4-3): Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall, Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Danilo, Orel Mangala, Neco Williams; Brennan Johnson, Taiwo Awoniyi, Morgan Gibbs-White.
SUBS: Ethan Horvath, Cheikhou Kouyate, Chris Wood, Harry Toffolo, Moussa Niakhite, Anthony Elanga, Ryan Yates, Remo Freuler, Hwang Ui-Jo.

Steve Cooper makes two changes from the defeat at Arsenal. Awoniyi is recalled to the starting XI after scoring from the bench at the Emirates, while Williams is also brought in with Aina and Yates dropping to the bench. Niakhite is also named among the substitutes after recovering from an elbow injury. Omar Richards, Felipe and Wayne Hennessey are long-term absentees.
Paul Heckingbottom also makes a couple of alterations from the opening weekend. Hamer makes his debut after signing from Coventry City with Vinicius also brought into the starting XI. Basham drops to the bench while Baldock misses out through injury. He joins a lengthy list of absentees including Oli McBurnie, John Fleck, Rhys Norrington-Davies, Jayden Bogle, Rhian Brewster, Daniel Jebbison and Ismaila Coulibaly.
This is the first Premier League meeting between the sides since May 1993. United won 2-0 at the City Ground that day to relegate Brian Clough's Forest from the top flight.
The players are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is just moments away.
The referee blows his whistle and the match is under way.
AWONIYI!!! 1-0 FOREST! The hosts make their positive start tell! Following a patient build-up, the ball is laid back to Aurier, whose cross is powered home by the head of Awoniyi.
Aurier floated a delicious ball into the box for Awoniyi to attack.
Awoniyi becomes the first Forest player to score in six successive Premier League games since Stan Collymore in 1995.
United look to respond immediately and force a corner. However, it comes to nothing as Forest defend well.
It has been an exciting opening to the game at the City Ground. Forest turned a purposeful start into the first goal of the contest, delighting the home crowd.
Forest have only lost once in their last 13 home league games against United. That sole defeat came back in December 2008.
The hosts were strong on home soil last season, losing just five of their 19 Premier League games here.
Good try! Forest counter with Awoniyi feeding Gibbs-White, who gets a shot away from the edge of the box, but Foderingham gets down to it.
United are trying to generate a threat on the Forest goal, but are unable to find a way through their stubborn hosts at the moment.
Forest push in search of a second goal and are awarded a corner. But it comes to nothing as United deal with the delivery.
The visitors look to get in behind the Forest defence, but the hosts just about manage to scramble the ball away.
Slowly but surely, United are beginning to gain a foothold in this contest. Although, they are still to register their first shot on goal.
The Blades have failed to win their first away league game in each of the last 11 seasons stretching back to a 2-0 win over Oldham Athletic in 2011-12.
Williams appeals for a penalty after taking a tumble in the box, but the referee is not interested.
Forest continue to threaten down the left flank, but Foderingham rises to collect a ball into the box.
Johnson cuts in from the right and unleashes a shot that deflects behind for a corner. Can the hosts capitalise?
CHANCE! Boly is unmarked as he meets Gibbs-White's corner delivery, but he is unable to keep his header down.
Good effort! United register their first shot following an attack down the right. Danilo clears but only as far as Vinicius, whose curling 25-yard strike is pushed away by Turner.
Boly drags Traore down and receives the first yellow card of the game.
The Blades enjoy a positive spell and almost get in behind the Forest defence, who manage to deflect a dangerous low ball behind for a corner.
A nervy moment for Foderingham, who races out of goal but is beaten to the ball by Gibbs-White. Thankfully for the visitors, they have cover and the ball ricochets kindly for Foderingham to eventually tidy up.
A break in play here with Johnson in need of attention. The Forest forward stayed down shortly after seeing his shot blocked from just outside the box.
After receiving attention from the medical team, Johnson is soon back on his feet and returns to the thick of the action.
Aurier demonstrates his frustration towards the referee, who wanted a word with the Forest wing-back. But he goes a bit too far and has his name taken.
Gibbs-White shows clever footwork to get out of a tight situation and race towards the United defence. But his eventual shot is a poor one that goes high into the stands.
We are into the first of two additional minutes at the end of this first half.
Norwood is the latest player to go into the referee's notebook.
HALF-TIME: NOTTINGHAM FOREST 1-0 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Nottingham Forest lead Sheffield United by a goal to nil at the break. Taiwo Awoniyi's third-minute header separates the sides at the City Ground. The goal came after a hugely positive start to the contest from the hosts, who are certainly good value for their half-time lead.
Although they started slowly, United grew into the contest and ended up enjoying more possession during the first half. However, they only registered a single shot on target - something they must improve after the break.
The visitors make a change at the break with Larouci replacing Lowe.
Off we go again! Forest get the ball rolling once more.
HAMER!!! 1-1! What a strike! And what a start to the second half by the visitors! United make a positive start to the second half and force a corner that is only cleared as far as Hamer, who sets himself before bending a stunning 20-yard strike into the top corner.
That was a debut goal to remember for Hamer. Straight into the team following his move from Coventry, he has wasted no time in making his mark.
Close! The visitors almost turn things around with the ball breaking kindly for Vinicius. He goes for placement 20 yards from goal, but his precise effort is just wide of the target.
The Blades have won just three of their last 29 away games in the Premier League, losing 22 of those. But they are well in with a shout here.
OFFSIDE! Forest think they have regained the lead as Awoniyi gets in behind and neatly lifts the ball into the net. However, his joy is short-lived when the offside flag is rightly raised.
Vinicius is unable to continue after picking up an earlier knock. He is replaced by Basham.
We are still level as we hit the hour mark at the City Ground. Will it remain this way, or will one of the teams take the spoils?
Danilo tries his luck from distance. But his ambitious attempt is high, wide and never troubling the goal.
Forest have a faint appeal for a penalty, but the referee is not interested and, instead, the hosts can threaten from a corner.
GOOD SAVE! Danger for the visitors as the ball ricochets kindly for Forest inside the penalty box. Aurier and Boly get shots away, but Foderingham shows great reflexes to deny the latter.
A positive spell for Forest, who are aiming to record four successive Premier League home wins for the first time since January 1996.
Forest make a double-change. The first sees Yates replace Mangala.
Elanga also enters the action with Boly making way.
Forest build up the pressure down the right flank. The ball falls kindly for Danilo on the edge of the box, but his tame effort is blocked.
Hamer is booked for a foul on Gibbs-White.
A change for the visitors with Osula replaced by Brooks.
The Blades have not recorded a draw in any of their last 25 Premier League outings. As things stand, that streak will end here.
A nervy moment for Forest as Turner is unable to gather the ball under pressure. But the goalkeeper was fouled and the referee penalises the visitors.
CHANCE! Forest are almost a punished for a real defensive mix-up! McKenna and Worrall get in each other's way as they go for the same ball, enabling Traore to race away. However, Turner comes to the hosts' rescue with fine reflexes to deny the United forward.
The hosts will know they got away with one there. A real lack of communication between their defenders was almost punished, and could have cost them the game.
Traore is unable to continue and goes off to be replaced by Hackford.
Awoniyi is given a breather. He is replaced by Wood for the final six minutes.
Osborn takes a little too long taking a throw-in and is booked for time-wasting.
We are into the final two minutes of regulation time. Can either side find a winner in these latter stages?
WOOD!!! 2-1 FOREST! The hosts may have just won it! After a corner is cleared, Worrall keeps the danger alive, finding Aurier on the wing. In plenty of space, the latter sets himself and delivers a delicious cross that is brilliantly guided in by Wood.
Aurier gets his second assist of the game with another lovely cross that was begging to be attacked.
As we enter the first of eight additional minutes, Kouyate replaces Danilo in the first of two more Forest changes.
Niakhite also comes on with Johnson given a breather.
What an impact by Wood! Introduced for Awoniyi, he took just five minutes to make a significant impact - one that could have earned his team all three points.
Chance! The hosts are very much in control of proceedings as the clock ticks down. The ball is fizzed across the box towards Elanga, but the ball ricochets against him and over the bar.
Just 60 seconds remain and United have the ball, but they need to get it forward and into the Forest penalty area.
The ball is swung into the Forest box, but after receiving a timely shout from a team-mate, Aurier lets it run behind for a goal kick. The hosts are almost there.
FULL-TIME: NOTTINGHAM FOREST 2-1 SHEFFIELD UNITED
Chris Wood was the hero as his late header secured Nottingham Forest's first points of the Premier League season. The substitute headed the winner in the 89th minute after Gustavo Hamer's debut goal cancelled out Taiwo Awoniyi's early header. Despite a spirited effort at the City Ground, Sheffield United remain pointless after their opening two games.
Both sides are back in action next weekend. Forest look to build on their momentum when they travel to Old Trafford to face Manchester United. Meanwhile, Sheffield United look to get their first points on the board when they entertain reigning champions Manchester City.

But he goes a bit too far and has his name taken.\nGibbs-White shows clever footwork to get out of a tight situation and race towards the United defence. But his eventual shot is a poor one that goes high into the stands.\nWe are into the first of two additional minutes at the end of this first half.\nNorwood is the latest player to go into the referee's notebook.\nHALF-TIME: Team_16 1-0 Team_17\nTeam_16 lead Team_17 by a goal to nil at the break. Taiwo Awoniyi's third-minute header separates the sides at the City Ground. The goal came after a hugely positive start to the contest from the hosts, who are certainly good value for their half-time lead.\nAlthough they started slowly, United grew into the contest and ended up enjoying more possession during the first half. However, they only registered a single shot on target - something they must improve after the break.\nThe visitors make a change at the break with Larouci replacing Lowe.\nOff we go again! Forest get the ball rolling once more.\nHAMER!!! 1-1! What a strike! And what a start to the second half by the visitors! United make a positive start to the second half and force a corner that is only cleared as far as Hamer, who sets himself before bending a stunning 20-yard strike into the top corner.\nThat was a debut goal to remember for Hamer. Straight into the team following his move from Coventry, he has wasted no time in making his mark.\nClose! The visitors almost turn things around with the ball breaking kindly for Vinicius. He goes for placement 20 yards from goal, but his precise effort is just wide of the target.\nThe Blades have won just three of their last 29 away games in the Premier League, losing 22 of those. But they are well in with a shout here.\nOFFSIDE! Forest think they have regained the lead as Awoniyi gets in behind and neatly lifts the ball into the net. However, his joy is short-lived when the offside flag is rightly raised.\nVinicius is unable to continue after picking up an earlier knock. He is replaced by Basham.\nWe are still level as we hit the hour mark at the City Ground. Will it remain this way, or will one of the teams take the spoils?\nDanilo tries his luck from distance. But his ambitious attempt is high, wide and never troubling the goal.\nForest have a faint appeal for a penalty, but the referee is not interested and, instead, the hosts can threaten from a corner.\nGOOD SAVE! Danger for the visitors as the ball ricochets kindly for Forest inside the penalty box. Aurier and Boly get shots away, but Foderingham shows great reflexes to deny the latter.\nA positive spell for Forest, who are aiming to record four successive Premier League home wins for the first time since January 1996.\nForest make a double-change. The first sees Yates replace Mangala.\nElanga also enters the action with Boly making way.\nForest build up the pressure down the right flank. The ball falls kindly for Danilo on the edge of the box, but his tame effort is blocked.\nHamer is booked for a foul on Gibbs-White.\nA change for the visitors with Osula replaced by Brooks.\nThe Blades have not recorded a draw in any of their last 25 Premier League outings. As things stand, that streak will end here.\nA nervy moment for Forest as Turner is unable to gather the ball under pressure. But the goalkeeper was fouled and the referee penalises the visitors.\nCHANCE! Forest are almost a punished for a real defensive mix-up! McKenna and Worrall get in each other's way as they go for the same ball, enabling Traore to race away. However, Turner comes to the hosts' rescue with fine reflexes to deny the United forward.\nThe hosts will know they got away with one there. A real lack of communication between their defenders was almost punished, and could have cost them the game.\nTraore is unable to continue and goes off to be replaced by Hackford.\nAwoniyi is given a breather. He is replaced by Wood for the final six minutes.\nOsborn takes a little too long taking a throw-in and is booked for time-wasting.\nWe are into the final two minutes of regulation time. Can either side find a winner in these latter stages?\nWOOD!!! 2-1 FOREST! The hosts may have just won it! After a corner is cleared, Worrall keeps the danger alive, finding Aurier on the wing. In plenty of space, the latter sets himself and delivers a delicious cross that is brilliantly guided in by Wood.\nAurier gets his second assist of the game with another lovely cross that was begging to be attacked.\nAs we enter the first of eight additional minutes, Kouyate replaces Danilo in the first of two more Forest changes.\nNiakhite also comes on with Johnson given a breather.\nWhat an impact by Wood! Introduced for Awoniyi, he took just five minutes to make a significant impact - one that could have earned his team all three points.\nChance! The hosts are very much in control of proceedings as the clock ticks down. The ball is fizzed across the box towards Elanga, but the ball ricochets against him and over the bar.\nJust 60 seconds remain and United have the ball, but they need to get it forward and into the Forest penalty area.\nThe ball is swung into the Forest box, but after receiving a timely shout from a team-mate, Aurier lets it run behind for a goal kick. The hosts are almost there.\nFULL-TIME: Team_16 2-1 Team_17\nChris Wood was the hero as his late header secured Team_16 first points of the Premier League season. The substitute headed the winner in the 89th minute after Gustavo Hamer's debut goal cancelled out Taiwo Awoniyi's early header. Despite a spirited effort at the City Ground, Team_17 remain pointless after their opening two games.\nBoth sides are back in action next weekend. Forest look to build on their momentum when they travel to Old Trafford to face Team_14. Meanwhile, Team_17 look to get their first points on the board when they entertain reigning champions Team_13.\nThat's all. Thank you for following our live coverage.

93564	Fulham	Aston Villa	2024-02-17	Craven Cottage, London	24401.0	Lewis Smith	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Newcastle United and Luton Town at St. James' Park.
Newcastle ended a four-match losing run in the Premier League with a 3-1 win over Aston Villa in their last outing. The Villans had won 16 of their previous 17 games at home in the top flight, but a brace from Fabian Schar and an own goal from Alex Moreno helped the Magpies to a comfortable three-goal lead before Ollie Watkins netted a consolation. A third straight-away victory in all competitions lifted Eddie Howe's men into eighth position. Newcastle are 14 points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, meaning their chances of qualifying for the Champions League for the second successive season is very unlikely. However, they will still be hoping that a place in the Europa League or Europa Conference League is in their grasp. Despite this, the Magpies must improve their form at St. James' Park, with the hosts losing back-to-back fixtures against Nottingham Forest and Manchester City.
Luton are in good form in the Premier League and have won three of their last five matches to take themselves out of the relegation zone and into 17th position. Securing two consecutive triumphs over Newcastle and Sheffield United at the start of the run, the Hatters lost 3-2 to Chelsea before collecting a point against Burnley. However, Rob Edwards' men returned to winning ways with their most emphatic win of the season in their previous match, with a hat-trick from Elijah Adebayo and a goal from Chiedozie Ogbene helping them secure a 4-0 win over European hopefuls Brighton. It was a special victory for Luton, with captain Tom Lockyer making his first appearance at Kenilworth Road since suffering a cardiac arrest in December's game at Bournemouth. The visitors will now be looking to complete a famous double over Newcastle for the first time since the 1937-38 campaign.
NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Kieran Trippier, Fabian Schar, Sven Botman, Dan Burn; Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Lewis Miley; Miguel Almiron, Jacob Murphy, Anthony Gordon.
NEWCASTLE UNITED SUBS: Paul Dummett, Callum Wilson, Matt Ritchie, Harvey Barnes, Emil Krafth, Loris Karius, Lewis Hall, Tino Livramento, Joe White.
LUTON TOWN (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Teden Mengi, Gabriel Osho, Amari'i Bell; Chiedozie Ogbene, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Ross Barkley, Alfie Doughty; Jordan Clark, Elijah Adebayo; Carlton Morris.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Issa Kabore, Tahith Chong, Reece Burke, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Jacob Brown, Tim Krul, Andros Townsend.
Newcastle make one enforced change to the side that beat Villa 3-1 in their last Premier League outing. Alexander Isak went off with a groin injury and is replaced in the attack by Almiron. However, there is a double boost for the injury-hit Magpies, with Barnes and Wilson back on the bench after a spell on the sidelines.
Luton make one alteration to the team that thumped Brighton 4-0 in midweek. Mengi comes into the defence and starts ahead of Burke. Former Newcastle winger Townsend, who scored the only goal in the reverse fixture, is on the bench.
This is the first time Newcastle are hosting Luton in a league match since September 1992, beating them 2-0 in the second tier under Kevin Keegan. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.
Luton get this Premier League clash under way. The Hatters will be hoping for another fast start, with Rob Edwards' men scoring twice in the first 137 seconds against Brighton in their last outing.
Luton start with an aggressive press and are looking to win possession in Newcastle's half. However, it opens the Hatters up for a counter, with Gordon racing down the right, cutting inside before having a pass across the box intercepted by Lokonga.
CHANCE! Luton are causing some early danger. Ogbene uses his speed to get on the end of a direct pass down the right. He gets beyond Burn and attempts to roll a pass across the box, but Schar slides across to make the interception.
Newcastle are passing the ball around their defensive third and are allowing Luton to come onto them. Schar takes too long in possession and Clark tackles him, but it rolls harmlessly back to Dubravka.
GOALLLL! LONGSTAFF SCORES! 1-0 NEWCASTLE! The hosts take an early lead. Miley collects possession just inside Luton's half and chips a superb pass down the right to Trippier. The right-back gets to the byline and cuts it back to Longstaff, who arrives in the box and drives his low effort into the bottom-left corner.
Miley's lofted pass down the right is excellent and it is matched by the pace of Trippier, who surges into the open space. The full-back then delivers an excellent cross into a dangerous area, with Longstaff burying his first-time strike.
Newcastle have lost just one of their last 17 Premier League games against promoted sides (winning nine and drawing seven), though it was their most recent match in the reverse fixture against Luton. Indeed, Luton could be just the second promoted side to do the double over the Magpies in the last seven seasons, after Leeds in 2020-21.
Ogbene is showing some real intent down the right. He bursts into the box and gets beyond Burn before cutting the ball back into the middle, but Schar clears it away for a throw-in.
Guimaraes is down just inside Luton's half and needs a few moments before returning to his feet. He looks to be struggling slightly. Howe will be hoping that it is nothing serious.
The battle between Ogbene and Burn on the right will be one to keep an eye on. The Luton winger is much quicker than the Magpies defender and is looking to go past him at every opportunity.
Adebayo runs down the left and wins Luton's first corner. Newcastle bring everyone back and load the box. Doughty finds Morris with an outswinging cross, but his tame header is caught with ease by Dubravka.
Burn makes a mess of a heavy touch on the right and is put under pressure by Ogbene, who wins possession well in an advanced position. However, he cannot get away from Burn, with the defender quickly winning it back.
Luton are sloppy in possession in their own half, with Newcastle winning it back on the left. Almiron collects it and attempts to curl an inviting cross into the box, but Kaminski rushes off his line to claim it.
GOALLL! LUTON ARE LEVEL! 1-1! Barkley is over a deep free-kick inside Newcastle's half on the right and he whips a cross onto the head of Morris. The striker knocks it across the box to Osho, who gets away from his maker and powers his header into the net.
Luton are always threatening from set-pieces and show their qualities again. Morris gets above his maker and finds Osho, who makes no mistake with an emphatic header from close range.
GOALLLL! LONGSTAFF SCORES AGAIN! 2-1 NEWCASTLE! The Magpies are ahead again. Gordon races away on the counter down the left and uses his pace to get beyond Osho. The winger then drives into the box and cuts onto his right foot before having a shot saved by Kaminski. However, Longstaff is quickest to the rebound to score.
Luton are winless in their last 21 league visits to the Magpies (drawing five and losing 16).
Trippier has a corner on the right and he curls an inswinging cross into the box. However, it goes over the head of everyone and out for a goal-kick. Osho was grabbing Botman and was fortunate not to be punished.
Kaminski is looking unconvincing in possession, with the Luton goalkeeper passing the ball straight out for a corner under pressure. Trippier tries a clever pass towards the outside of the box, but Clark reads it and makes the interception.
Doughty loses possession in Luton's half to Murphy, who attempts to whip a right-footed cross into the box from the right. However, Kaminski is quick off his line to catch it. The Hatters will be punished if they continue to lose the ball in their defensive third.
Adebayo looks to dribble past Botman to get into the box on the right but is stopped by the centre-back. He thinks he should have a free-kick, but the referee ignores his claims. The striker then shows his frustrations and fouls Schar.
Gordon arrives on the edge of the box on the right and offloads a pass to Murphy. He sets it across to Guimaraes, who makes a deep run from midfield to create an option, but he takes a heavy touch and the chance is gone.
Newcastle are having all the chances at the moment. Trippier strolls down the right and looks for options, finding Murphy on the overlap. He then cuts a pass across to Gordon, who makes a mess of the shot, sending his effort wide.
Ogbene trips an onrushing Miley next to the touchline on the left and gifts Newcastle a free-kick in a crossing position. Trippier switches sides to take it, but his ball into the box is cleared away with ease.
Luton's second corner is taken on the right by Doughty. However, his outswinging cross is headed away. The Hatters retain possession but are forced back to the halfway line by Newcastle's press.
GOALLL! BARKLEY SCORES! 2-2! Luton equalises for the second time. Barkley wins possession off Longstaff and drives towards the edge of the box before sliding a pass down the left to Doughty. His low strike is saved by Dubravka, but Barkley is there to thump in the rebound.
Barkley has now scored six goals in 16 appearances in the Premier League against Newcastle. He loves scoring against the Magpies and comes up with a valuable equaliser.
Adebayo has the ball on the right and directs a low cross towards Morris. However, the striker is put under pressure by Botman and cannot get it under control. Dubravka then claims it with ease.
There will be four minutes of additional time.
Morris gives away a needless foul just inside Newcastle's half with a push, giving the Magpies a chance to throw men forward towards the end of the first half. However, Mengi heads it clear just inside Luton's box.
Newcastle pass their way out of pressure and build an attack down the right after a clever pass from Gordon. Trippier and Murphy combine, with the latter sending a searching cross into the box that is put behind by Mengi.
HALF-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 2-2 LUTON TOWN
Luton twice came from behind against Newcastle to send the teams into the break level at St. James' Park with the score 2-2. Longstaff netted the opener for the hosts inside seven minutes, getting onto the end of Trippier's low cross to power his low, first-time strike into the bottom-left corner. Osho then replied with a header from close range before the Magpies regained the lead moments later. Gordon made a surging run down the left before cutting into the box and unleashing a curling effort. Kaminski pushed it away, but Longstaff was there to score the rebound for his second goal of the contest. However, Barkley ensured that an entertaining first 45 minutes ended level. He dispossessed Longstaff and rolled a pass down the left side of the box to Doughty, who had his low strike saved. The ball dropped straight to the feet of Barkley, with the midfielder taking a touch to compose himself before thumping in the equaliser.
Luton created better opportunities before the break and created an xG (expected goals) of 1.27 compared to Newcastle's 0.99. Barkley had their most touches (47) and completed 88.2 per cent of his passes in an impressive midfield display. However, the Hatters must be more careful in the defensive third, as they have often gifted the ball to the Magpies, who haven't been able to capitalise. As for the hosts, they will be disappointed with their lack of control at home. Howe's men have had just 48.7 per cent of the possession, with most of their best opportunities coming from counters.
Howe makes a change before the restart to try and make Newcastle's attack more threatening. He brings on Wilson to add a recognised striker, with the England international making his first appearance since December 26. Gordon is off.
Newcastle get the ball rolling again.
Almiron twists in possession on the right and slides a fantastic throughball to Trippier, who races forward before going down under pressure from Doughty. He wants a free-kick on the edge of the box, but nothing is given.
SAVE! Huge opportunity for Newcastle. Wilson does brilliantly to collect the ball with his back to goal before flicking it around to Miley. He then finds Murphy, who gets into the box and dribbles past a defender before having a low drive saved by the foot of Kaminski.
Ogbene brings the ball forward down the right, waiting for support before sliding a pass down the wing to Clark. He attempts to loft a cross into the middle towards Adebayo, but it goes over his head and away from danger.
Murphy has a shot blocked just inside the box, but Newcastle retain possession through Miley, who gives it back to him. The winger then gets beyond a defender before lashing a shot wide of the near post on the left.
PENALTY SHOUT! Luton have a free-kick on the edge of the box, but the Hatters want a penalty. Ogbene drives beyond Burn on the right and gets past him before getting dragged back right on the edge.
Burn is shown a yellow card for dragging back Ogbene on the edge of the box. The VAR check is ongoing for a possible penalty.
PENALTY TO LUTON! The Hatters have the chance to get themselves ahead. Burn was dragging back Ogbene on the edge of the box, but the foul continued inside and a penalty is given. Morris has the ball in his hand.
WHAT! Morris strikes the penalty to the right of the goal and into the net, but the referee isn't ready and Morris is forced to take it again.
GOALLL! MORRIS SCORES! 3-2 LUTON! The Hatters are ahead for the first time. Morris takes a slow run before slotting his effort down the right side of the goal. Dubravka dives the other way.
Lokonga is shown a yellow card after dragging back Guimaraes around the halfway mark.
GOALLL! ADEBAYO SCORES! 4-2 LUTON! The Hatters score again! Trippier advances forward and leaves Doughty plenty of space to run into. He slides a pass across to Barkley, who is on the edge of the box. The midfielder then rolls a pass down the right to Adebayo, who drives his low strike across the goal and into the bottom-left corner.
Barkley has been excellent for Luton and adds an assist to his goal. He could shoot on the edge of the box but waits for the run of  Adebayo, who is completely free and finishes clinically.
Barnes makes his first appearance since September after a serious injury. He is on for Almiron in the attack.
Burn has had a torrid time at left-back and gave away a penalty for Luton's third goal. The electric Livramento replaces him in the defence to try and add some attacking qualities.
Adebayo has scored seven goals in his last eight Premier League appearances and netted the Hatters’ first top-flight hat-trick since September 1990 (Lars Elstrup vs Norwich) in their 4-0 win over Brighton.
GOALLLLL! TRIPPIER GETS ONE BACK FOR NEWCASTLE! The hosts needed that! Miley finds Guimaraes on the left, with the midfielder curling a cross with the outside of his boot towards Trippier. The right-back gets ahead of his marker and sends a first-time effort into the bottom-left corner. Luton lead 4-3.
A moment of brilliance from Guimaraes. He is on the corner of the box on the left and finds Trippier with an inventive cross with the outside of his boot. Trippier makes a bursting run and scores to get Newcastle's third goal.
Luton make a change immediately after Newcastle's goal. Mpanzu is on to replace Clark in this frantic contest.
Newcastle have lost their last two Premier League home games, as many as in their previous 16 at St James’ Park (winning 13 and drawing one). They last lost three in a row between January and February 2021 under Steve Bruce. They have the momentum and the home fans on their side, but Luton are still ahead.
Trippier is over a free-kick on the right in a crossing position. Wilson attacks it and Barkley heads it into the air. Kaminski pushes it away but not convincingly, with Schar's effort deflecting wide.
GOALLL! BARNES SCORES! 4-4! Newcastle come from two goals behind to level the score! Barnes receives possession from Miley on the edge of the box and shifts the ball onto his left foot before curling a low effort into the bottom-left corner. He went for accuracy rather than power to find the equaliser.
Miley is involved again, this time with a short pass on the edge of the box. However, the goal is all about Barnes, who curls his strike from range into the bottom-left corner.
Murphy makes a late slide tackle on Ogbene and is shown a yellow card.
WIDE! Newcastle are pushing for their fifth goal. Murphy gets down the right and flashes an inviting cross into the box. It is headed away from Wilson by Osho but straight to Barnes. He looks to score his second off the bench, with his right-footed effort defecting off of Mengi and behind.
Morris scored Luton's third and is now coming off. He hands the captain's armband to Mpanzu before coming off for Brown.
Doughty is also on his way off after an energetic performance on the left. He is replaced by Burke, who started the last match.
Brown gets straight into the action, getting down the left of the box and towards the byline. However, his cutback goes straight into the gloves of Dubravka.
WIDE! Schar drives through the middle of the pitch before rolling a pass down the left to Barnes. He curls a low shot across the goal, with the ball taking a slight deflection. Kaminski reacts quickly and pushes it behind.
Wilson protects the ball well from Osho and loops a pass over the top of Luton's defence, but Kaminski runs off his line to catch it.
OVER! What an opportunity for Murphy. Guimaraes speeds down the left and looks to get his second assist with the outside of his right foot. The ball flashes across the face of the goal and towards Murphy, but he shoots over from a tight angle.
Adebayo went down a few moments ago but is now back on his feet to come off. Woodrow is on for the final few minutes to try and make an impression. What an opportunity for the striker to score the winner.
Schar takes a quick free-kick in Newcastle's half and drives a pass forward to Wilson. He accidentally trips Osho and gives away a free-kick after a tangle of legs.
Osho goes into the book after dragging back Wilson.
There will be 10 minutes of additional time. There should be no surprise after four goals and VAR drama!
Newcastle have all the momentum and are pushing for the winner. They still have seven minutes to score their fifth goal but are looking to put crosses into the box at every opportunity. Luton have a height advantage and have dealt with the pressure well.
Ogbene and Woodrow play a clever one-two on the right, giving the former of the pair space to run into. He gets to the byline and cuts a pass back towards Mpanzu, but Livramento makes an important covering run to make the interception.
Brown is down and receiving treatment after a collision. However, he will be able to continue. This will only further extend the added time and the drama.
Trippier trips Mpanzu and wins a free-kick in a crossing position for Luton. Barkley's cross drops in the middle of the box before getting hacked away by the Newcastle defence.
CHANCE! What an opportunity for Luton to score the winner. Barkley makes the most of a loose pass from Schar. He has possession on the left and curls a right-footed cross over to Ogbene on the right side of the box. He attempts a first-time volley, but Dubravka makes a simple save under pressure.
The allocated additional time has now ended, but the match continues. Newcastle surge forward on the counter. However, Luton get men back before Trippier's cross from the right is blocked.
FULL-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 4-4 LUTON TWON
Newcastle came from two goals down in the second half to draw 4-4 with Luton in a Premier League classic at St. James' Park. The Hatters twice came from behind before the break to level the score. Longstaff netted a brace, getting onto the end of Trippier's cutback to break the deadlock before reacting the quickest to a rebounded strike from Gordon to add his second. However, the Hatters were resilient. Osho headed in their first, with Barkley crashing in his strike from close range after Doughty's shot was pushed into his path. Luton then gained control after scoring twice to go 4-2 ahead. The referee pointed to the spot after a VAR check, with Burn pulling back Ogbene just inside the box. Morris rolled in the spot-kick to put the visitors ahead before Adebayo added their fourth with a low strike into the bottom-left corner. However, they couldn't hold onto their lead. Trippier started the comeback with a goal before Barnes netted their leveller with an accurate strike from the edge into the bottom-left corner. Next up, Newcastle travel to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League, with Luton hosting Sheffield United. That's all, goodbye."	"Ollie Watkins’ return to form continued with a double that lifted Aston Villa into the top four with a 2-1 win at Fulham. 
Villa took advantage of Tottenham Hotspur's 2-1 defeat at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers to go into the top four with 49 points. 
How the match unfolded
Fulham were unchanged while Unai Emery made two enforced changes – the injured duo of Diego Carlos and Boubacar Kamara were replaced by Pau Torres and Youri Tielemans.
After a stop-start opening, Watkins claimed his 12th Premier League goal of the season, capitalising on a poor Fulham throw to pick up the ball from Jacob Ramsey before swivelling and drilling the ball past Bernd Leno in the 23rd minute. 
Leon Bailey almost doubled the lead five minutes later with a brilliant bit of skill and then shot, but his dipping effort struck the bar. 
Alex Moreno also came close to scoring Villa’s second but he was adjudged to be offside before heading in from Watkins’ flick-on. Just before half-time Watkins broke clear and set up Tielemans but Leno came out well to smother his shot and keep the visitors’ lead at one goal at the break. 
Fulham started the second half well after Willian was replaced by Alex Iwobi on the Nigerian's return from the Africa Cup of Nations. But Villa grabbed their second goal on 56 minutes, again through Watkins. The striker was found by Tielemans’ through-ball and finished with aplomb. 
Out of nowhere Fulham got a goal back. Antonee Robinson outpaced Matty Cash down the left and crossed, and Rodrigo Muniz got to the ball ahead of both Emiliano Martinez and Clement Lenglet at the near post to score his fourth goal in three matches. 
Fulham came close to an equaliser from a sweeping move that ended with Iwobi shooting from close range, but Martinez, having dived the wrong way, stopped the shot with his legs before Harry Wilson shot wide. 
Fulham continued to threaten but substitute Adama Traore was also unable to beat Martinez in stoppage time. The Cottagers remain 12th with 29 points.

Schar takes too long in possession and Clark tackles him, but it rolls harmlessly back to Dubravka.\nGOALLLL!\xa0LONGSTAFF SCORES! 1-0 Team_15! The hosts take an early lead. Miley collects possession just inside Luton's half and chips a superb pass down the right to\xa0Trippier. The right-back gets to the byline and cuts it back to Longstaff, who arrives in the box and drives his low effort into the bottom-left corner.\nMiley's lofted pass down the right is excellent and it is matched by the pace of Trippier, who surges into the open space. The full-back then delivers an excellent cross into a dangerous area, with Longstaff burying his first-time strike.\nTeam_15 have lost just one of their last 17 Premier League games against promoted sides (winning nine and drawing seven), though it was their most recent match in the reverse fixture against Luton. Indeed, Luton could be just the second promoted side to do the double over the Magpies in the last seven seasons, after Leeds in 2020-21.\nOgbene is showing some real intent down the right. He bursts into the box and gets beyond Burn before cutting the ball back into the middle, but Schar clears it away for a throw-in.\nGuimaraes is down just inside Luton's half and needs a few moments before returning to his feet. He looks to be struggling slightly. Howe will be hoping that it is nothing serious.\nThe battle between Ogbene and Burn on the right will be one to keep an eye on. The Luton winger is much quicker than the Magpies defender and is looking to go past him at every opportunity.\nAdebayo runs down the left and wins Luton's first corner. Team_15 bring everyone back and load the box. Doughty finds Morris with an outswinging cross, but his tame header is caught with ease by Dubravka.\nBurn makes a mess of a heavy touch on the right and is put under pressure by Ogbene, who wins possession well in an advanced position. However, he cannot get away from Burn, with the defender quickly winning it back.\nLuton are sloppy in possession in their own half, with Team_15 winning it back on the left. Almiron collects it and attempts to curl an inviting cross into the box, but Kaminski rushes off his line to claim it.\nGOALLL! LUTON ARE LEVEL! 1-1! Barkley is over a deep free-kick inside Team_15 half on the right and he whips a cross onto the head of Morris. The striker knocks it across the box to Osho, who gets away from his maker and powers his header into the net.\nLuton are always threatening from set-pieces and show their qualities again. Morris gets above his maker and finds Osho, who makes no mistake with an emphatic header from close range.\nGOALLLL! LONGSTAFF SCORES AGAIN! 2-1 Team_15! The Magpies are ahead again. Gordon races away on the counter down the left and uses his pace to get beyond Osho. The winger then drives into the box and cuts onto his right foot before having a shot saved by Kaminski. However, Longstaff is quickest to the rebound to score.\nLuton are winless in their last 21 league visits to the Magpies (drawing five and losing 16).\nTrippier has a corner on the right and he curls an inswinging cross into the box. However, it goes over the head of everyone and out for a goal-kick. Osho was grabbing Botman and was fortunate not to be punished.\nKaminski is looking unconvincing in possession, with the Luton goalkeeper passing the ball straight out for a corner under pressure. Trippier tries a clever pass towards the outside of the box, but Clark reads it and makes the interception.\nDoughty loses possession in Luton's half to Murphy, who attempts to whip a right-footed cross into the box from the right. However, Kaminski is quick off his line to catch it. The Hatters will be punished if they continue to lose the ball in their defensive third.\nAdebayo looks to dribble past Botman to get into the box on the right but is stopped by the centre-back. He thinks he should have a free-kick, but the referee ignores his claims. The striker then shows his frustrations and fouls Schar.\nGordon arrives on the edge of the box on the right and offloads a pass to Murphy. He sets it across to Guimaraes, who makes a deep run from midfield to create an option, but he takes a heavy touch and the chance is gone.\nTeam_15 are having all the chances at the moment. Trippier strolls down the right and looks for options, finding Murphy on the overlap. He then cuts a pass across to Gordon, who makes a mess of the shot, sending his effort wide.\nOgbene trips an onrushing Miley next to the touchline on the left and gifts Team_15 a free-kick in a crossing position. Trippier switches sides to take it, but his ball into the box is cleared away with ease.\nLuton's second corner is taken on the right by Doughty. However, his outswinging cross is headed away. The Hatters retain possession but are forced back to the halfway line by Team_15 press.\nGOALLL! BARKLEY SCORES! 2-2! Luton equalises for the second time. Barkley wins possession off Longstaff and drives towards the edge of the box before sliding a pass down the left to Doughty. His low strike is saved by Dubravka, but Barkley is there to thump in the rebound.\nBarkley has now scored six goals in 16 appearances in the Premier League against Team_15. He loves scoring against the Magpies and comes up with a valuable equaliser.\nAdebayo has the ball on the right and directs a low cross towards Morris. However, the striker is put under pressure by Botman and cannot get it under control. Dubravka then claims it with ease.\nThere will be four minutes of additional time.\nMorris gives away a needless foul just inside Team_15 half with a push, giving the Magpies a chance to throw men forward towards the end of the first half. However, Mengi heads it clear just inside Luton's box.\nTeam_15 pass their way out of pressure and build an attack down the right after a clever pass from Gordon. Trippier and Murphy combine, with the latter sending a searching cross into the box that is put behind by Mengi.\nHALF-TIME: Team_15 2-2 Team_12\nLuton twice came from behind against Team_15 to send the teams into the break level at St. James' Park with the score 2-2. Longstaff netted the opener for the hosts inside seven minutes, getting onto the end of Trippier's low cross to power his low, first-time strike into the bottom-left corner. Osho then replied with a header from close range before the Magpies regained the lead moments later. Gordon made a surging run down the left before cutting into the box and unleashing a curling effort. Kaminski pushed it away, but Longstaff was there to score the rebound for his second goal of the contest. However, Barkley ensured that an entertaining first 45 minutes ended level. He dispossessed Longstaff and rolled a pass down the left side of the box to Doughty, who had his low strike saved. The ball dropped straight to the feet of Barkley, with the midfielder taking a touch to compose himself before thumping in the equaliser.\nLuton created better opportunities before the break and created an xG (expected goals) of 1.27 compared to Team_15 0.99. Barkley had their most touches (47) and completed 88.2 per cent of his passes in an impressive midfield display. However, the Hatters must be more careful in the defensive third, as they have often gifted the ball to the Magpies, who haven't been able to capitalise. As for the hosts, they will be disappointed with their lack of control at home. Howe's men have had just 48.7 per cent of the possession, with most of their best opportunities coming from counters.\nHowe makes a change before the restart to try and make Team_15 attack more threatening. He brings on Wilson to add a recognised striker, with the England international making his first appearance since December 26. Gordon is off.\nTeam_15 get the ball rolling again.\nAlmiron twists in possession on the right and slides a fantastic throughball to Trippier, who races forward before going down under pressure from Doughty. He wants a free-kick on the edge of the box, but nothing is given.\nSAVE! Huge opportunity for Team_15. Wilson does brilliantly to collect the ball with his back to goal before flicking it around to Miley. He then finds Murphy, who gets into the box and dribbles past a defender before having a low drive saved by the foot of Kaminski.\nOgbene brings the ball forward down the right, waiting for support before sliding a pass down the wing to Clark. He attempts to loft a cross into the middle towards Adebayo, but it goes over his head and away from danger.\nMurphy has a shot blocked just inside the box, but Team_15 retain possession through Miley, who gives it back to him. The winger then gets beyond a defender before lashing a shot wide of the near post on the left.\nPENALTY SHOUT! Luton have a free-kick on the edge of the box, but the Hatters want a penalty. Ogbene drives beyond Burn on the right and gets past him before getting dragged back right on the edge.\nBurn is shown a yellow card for dragging back\xa0Ogbene on the edge of the box. The VAR check is ongoing for a possible penalty.\nPENALTY TO LUTON! The Hatters have the chance to get themselves ahead. Burn was dragging back Ogbene on the edge of the box, but the foul continued inside and a penalty is given. Morris has the ball in his hand.\nWHAT! Morris strikes the penalty to the right of the goal and into the net, but the referee isn't ready and Morris is forced to take it again.\nGOALLL! MORRIS SCORES! 3-2 LUTON! The Hatters are ahead for the first time. Morris takes a slow run before slotting his effort down the right side of the goal. Dubravka dives the other way.\nLokonga is shown a yellow card after dragging back Guimaraes around the halfway mark.\nGOALLL!\xa0ADEBAYO SCORES! 4-2 LUTON! The Hatters score again! Trippier advances forward and leaves\xa0Doughty plenty of space to run into. He slides a pass across to Barkley, who is on the edge of the box. The midfielder then rolls a pass down the right to Adebayo, who drives his low strike across the goal and into the bottom-left corner.\nBarkley has been excellent for Luton and adds an assist to his goal. He could shoot on the edge of the box but waits for the run of \xa0Adebayo, who is completely free and finishes clinically.\nBarnes makes his first appearance since September after a serious injury. He is on for\xa0Almiron in the attack.\nBurn has had a torrid time at left-back and gave away a penalty for Luton's third goal. The electric Livramento replaces him in the defence to try and add some attacking qualities.\nAdebayo has scored seven goals in his last eight Premier League appearances and netted the Hatters’ first top-flight hat-trick since September 1990 (Lars Elstrup vs Norwich) in their 4-0 win over Team_5.\nGOALLLLL! TRIPPIER GETS ONE BACK FOR Team_15! The hosts needed that! Miley finds Guimaraes on the left, with the midfielder curling a cross with the outside of his boot towards Trippier. The right-back gets ahead of his marker and sends a first-time effort into the bottom-left corner. Luton lead 4-3.\nA moment of brilliance from Guimaraes. He is on the corner of the box on the left and finds Trippier with an inventive cross with the outside of his boot. Trippier makes a bursting run and scores to get Team_15 third goal.\nLuton make a change immediately after Team_15 goal.\xa0Mpanzu is on to replace\xa0Clark in this frantic contest.\nTeam_15 have lost their last two Premier League home games, as many as in their previous 16 at St James’ Park (winning 13 and drawing one). They last lost three in a row between January and February 2021 under Steve Bruce. They have the momentum and the home fans on their side, but Luton are still ahead.\nTrippier is over a free-kick on the right in a crossing position. Wilson attacks it and Barkley heads it into the air. Kaminski pushes it away but not convincingly, with Schar's effort deflecting wide.\nGOALLL! BARNES SCORES! 4-4! Team_15 come from two goals behind to level the score! Barnes receives possession from Miley on the edge of the box and shifts the ball onto his left foot before curling a low effort into the bottom-left corner. He went for accuracy rather than power to find the equaliser.\nMiley is involved again, this time with a short pass on the edge of the box. However, the goal is all about Barnes, who curls his strike from range into the bottom-left corner.\nMurphy\xa0makes a late slide tackle on\xa0Ogbene\xa0and is shown a yellow card.\nWIDE! Team_15 are pushing for their fifth goal. Murphy gets down the right and flashes an inviting cross into the box. It is headed away from Wilson by Osho but straight to Barnes. He looks to score his second off the bench, with his right-footed effort defecting off of Mengi and behind.\nMorris scored Luton's third and is now coming off. He hands the captain's armband to Mpanzu before coming off for Brown.\nDoughty is also on his way off after an energetic performance on the left. He is replaced by Burke, who started the last match.\nBrown gets straight into the action, getting down the left of the box and towards the byline. However, his cutback goes straight into the gloves of Dubravka.\nWIDE! Schar drives through the middle of the pitch before rolling a pass down the left to Barnes. He curls a low shot across the goal, with the ball taking a slight deflection. Kaminski reacts quickly and pushes it behind.\nWilson protects the ball well from Osho and loops a pass over the top of Luton's defence, but Kaminski runs off his line to catch it.\nOVER! What an opportunity for Murphy. Guimaraes speeds down the left and looks to get his second assist with the outside of his right foot. The ball flashes across the face of the goal and towards Murphy, but he shoots over from a tight angle.\nAdebayo went down a few moments ago but is now back on his feet to come off. Woodrow is on for the final few minutes to try and make an impression. What an opportunity for the striker to score the winner.\nSchar takes a quick free-kick in Team_15 half and drives a pass forward to Wilson. He accidentally trips Osho and gives away a free-kick after a tangle of legs.\nOsho goes into the book after dragging back Wilson.\nThere will be 10 minutes of additional time. There should be no surprise after four goals and VAR drama!\nTeam_15 have all the momentum and are pushing for the winner. They still have seven minutes to score their fifth goal but are looking to put crosses into the box at every opportunity. Luton have a height advantage and have dealt with the pressure well.\nOgbene and Woodrow play a clever one-two on the right, giving the former of the pair space to run into. He gets to the byline and cuts a pass back towards Mpanzu, but Livramento makes an important covering run to make the interception.\nBrown is down and receiving treatment after a collision. However, he will be able to continue. This will only further extend the added time and the drama.\nTrippier trips Mpanzu and wins a free-kick in a crossing position for Luton. Barkley's cross drops in the middle of the box before getting hacked away by the Team_15 defence.\nCHANCE! What an opportunity for Luton to score the winner. Barkley makes the most of a loose pass from Schar. He has possession on the left and curls a right-footed cross over to Ogbene on the right side of the box. He attempts a first-time volley, but Dubravka makes a simple save under pressure.\nThe allocated additional time has now ended, but the match continues. Team_15 surge forward on the counter. However, Luton get men back before Trippier's cross from the right is blocked.\nFULL-TIME: Team_15 4-4 LUTON TWON\nTeam_15 came from two goals down in the second half to draw 4-4 with Luton in a Premier League classic at St. James' Park. The Hatters twice came from behind before the break to level the score. Longstaff netted a brace, getting onto the end of Trippier's cutback to break the deadlock before reacting the quickest to a rebounded strike from Gordon to add his second. However, the Hatters were resilient. Osho headed in their first, with Barkley crashing in his strike from close range after Doughty's shot was pushed into his path. Luton then gained control after scoring twice to go 4-2 ahead. The referee pointed to the spot after a VAR check, with Burn pulling back Ogbene just inside the box. Morris rolled in the spot-kick to put the visitors ahead before Adebayo added their fourth with a low strike into the bottom-left corner. However, they couldn't hold onto their lead. Trippier started the comeback with a goal before Barnes netted their leveller with an accurate strike from the edge into the bottom-left corner. Next up, Team_15 travel to Team_16 in the Premier League, with Luton hosting Team_17. That's all, goodbye.""]"	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	Exciting
93392	Brighton	Liverpool	2023-10-08	American Express Stadium, Falmer	31752.0	Anthony Taylor	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of this Premier League clash as Luton Town face Wolves at Kenilworth Road!
We've got an early-season six-pointer for you here as Luton face Wolves. The hosts are the only Premier League side still seeking their first point of the season ahead of matchday six, after Burnley claimed a draw at Nottingham Forest on Monday. Rob Edwards' Hatters could become the sixth team in Premier League history to start a season with five straight defeats – three of the previous five finished bottom of the table.
There have been plenty of positives for Gary O'Neil to take from Wolves' early-season showings, but last week's 3-1 defeat to Liverpool left them with three points from their first five matches of the Premier League season. The likes of Pedro Neto, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Joao Gomes impressed against the Reds, but Wolves ran out of steam in the second half after taking an early lead. O'Neil will be aware of the need to turn encouraging performances into results, particularly against their fellow strugglers.
LUTON TOWN (5-2-3): Thomas Kaminski; Issa Kabore, Reece Burke, Tom Lockyer, Amari'i Bell, Alfie Doughty; Marvelous Nakamba, Albert Sambi Lokonga; Jacob Brown, Carlton Morris, Chiedozie Ogbene.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: Tim Krul, Mads Andersen, Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Elijah Adebayo, Tahith Chong, Teden Mengi, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Ryan Giles.
WOLVES (4-2-3-1): Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Maximilian Kilman, Craig Dawson, Rayan Ait-Nouri; Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina; Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Pedro Neto; Matheus Cunha.
WOLVES SUBS: Dan Bentley, Matt Doherty, Boubacar Traore, Fabio Silva, Hugo Bueno, Sasa Kalajdzic, Tommy Doyle, Pablo Sarabia, Toti Gomes.
Edwards makes two changes to the team that started last week's defeat at Fulham. Ross Barkley is still absent due to a hamstring injury, while Andersen and Chong drop to the bench. Ogbene and Doughty come in, with former Wolves wing-back Giles among the substitutes again.
Wolves, meanwhile, are unchanged from last week's 3-1 loss to Liverpool. O'Neil's men started that game at breakneck speed and it will be interesting to see whether they can maintain that intensity against less-fancied opponents. Neto leads the Premier League charts for assists (four) and chances created (17) this campaign and should offer a direct outlet on the visitors' left flank.
Luton are just the second team to lose their first four games as a Premier League club, along with Swindon Town in 1993, who drew 0-0 at Norwich City in their fifth game. Can the Hatters get their campaign up and running here? Kick-off is approaching and we're about to find out!
We're under way for just the second Premier League game to be played at Kenilworth Road! The hosts get us going and go long straight away, but the ball is quickly with Sa.
As you would expect, there's a fantastic atmosphere here. Luton win a free-kick out wide on the right as Ait-Nouri brings Ogbene down. They'll look to lift this into the Wolves area.
It's played short to Doughty, but his left-footed strike is straight into the wall before Brown sees a cross blocked by Semedo.
Gomes goes down after being caught in midfield, but the Brazilian is swiftly back to his feet. It's been a scrappy, high-octane start, which Luton won't mind one bit! They'll be keen to turn this contest into a physical battle.
Chance! Ogbene gets down the left to swing a cross into Wolves' area. His delivery is over Morris and Brown is attacking it at the far post, but Ait-Nouri does brilliantly to nod it behind his own goal.
Luton fail to make anything of the game's first corner before Bell sees his second delivery blocked. They've done a good job of penning Wolves back early on, however.
Wolves are struggling here! Sa flaps at Bell's deep cross, but there is no orange shirt there to attack the loose ball. Hwang then looks to break, but he runs it straight out of play on the visitors' left!
Wolves – donning their sky blue third kit – come forward for the first time, but Hwang is caught offside from Ait-Nouri's ball in behind.
OFF THE POST! Luton go so close to the opener! Morris latches onto a loose ball 20 yards from goal before shifting it onto his right foot. His curling, long-range effort has Sa beaten, but it bounces off the upright and the visitors can clear!
Luton are the Premier League's joint-lowest scorers with two goals (alongside Everton), while only Burnley (12) and Wolves (11) have conceded more than their 10 goals against, even though the Hatters have only played four matches. They have made an impressive start to this game, however.
This is a concerning moment for Wolves. Sa has gone down in the goalmouth, holding his left foot and appearing to be in some discomfort. He needs to receive treatment, though the home fans are not particularly sympathetic.
Sa is back on his feet and looks set to continue for now.
Luton are quick to drop into a 5-2-3 shape whenever they lose the ball. Wolves are struggling to get the likes of Cunha, Bellegarde and Neto involved on a regular basis – Neto has only had one touch.
Luton threaten down the left once again as Doughty finds space for a cross. He hangs it up towards Brown at the far post, but his header is straight at Sa. It's been one-way traffic so far!
Blocked by his own team-mate! Brown finds space for a shot just inside the area, but Morris gets in the way of his effort! Doughty then wins – and takes – a free-kick on the left, which Brown glances comfortably over the crossbar.
Luton have managed seven shots to Wolves' zero so far, though the Hatters have only hit the target once. They need to make this spell of sustained pressure count. Lemina concedes a corner on the Luton left.
The corner is cleared by the first defender, and a scrappy passage of play ends with Wolves receiving a goal-kick. The visitors have appeared rattled by Luton's physicality early on.
Hwang goes down following a tussle with Bell on halfway, claiming he was caught in the face. There was contact, but it was certainly accidental.
Neto finally gets a chance to run at Kabore. He beats the right wing-back with ease before flashing a cross across the face of goal, but there are no blue shirts attacking it.
This is the first top-flight meeting between Luton and Wolves since the 1983-84 campaign, with the Hatters winning home (4-0) and away (2-1) games against Wolves that season, when the Molineux men went on to finish bottom.
Cunha finds Neto out wide to start a Wolves break, and the winger plays it left to Ait-Nouri. The left-back sees his cutback turned behind for a corner, from which Brown stands firm to clear.
Bellegarde swings a right-footed delivery towards the far post, where Morris decides to let it run. He hadn't seen Kilman lurking behind him, but the Wolves captain is unable to keep it alive.
Wolves have settled down and are enjoying more time on the ball as we pass the half-hour mark, but they are yet to trouble Kaminski in the Luton goal.
Wolves are enjoying a sustained spell of possession inside Luton's half now, but that Hatters block continues to stand firm and deny the visitors space.
The referee halts play as both Kabore and Brown are left in a heap. Brown looks to have been caught on the top of the head by Kilman, while Kabore is holding his leg. Both men require treatment.
Both teams take the opportunity to receive instructions from the managers, before Wolves restart the game with a drop-ball. Brown and Kabore are both able to continue.
Wolves are still yet to record a shot of any kind in this match, though they are beginning to exercise some control in midfield as Gomes is fouled by Lokonga.
RED CARD FOR BELLEGARDE! WOLVES ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN! Lockyer and Bellegarde tussle for the ball and both men go down. Caught between the Luton man's legs, Bellegarde looks to escape and kicks out at the Hatters' defender. The referee calls the play back and issues a red card!
There's a VAR review to check whether Bellegarde's kick warranted a straight red card, but the on-field decision is swiftly confirmed! The Wolves man might feel hard done by as he was looking to escape a tangle of legs, but you can't lash out like that!
O'Neil will be absolutely furious. Just as Wolves were beginning to take control of the contest, they pick up a straight red card. It's going to be a long 50 minutes or so for the visitors now!
WHAT A LET-OFF FOR WOLVES! Dawson plays a no-look pass back towards his own goal, not realising Sa had moved off his line! Brown is looking to turn the ball into an unguarded net, but Kilman gets back to clear!
Lemina's quick free-kick almost gets Neto in behind, but Lockyer gets back with a huge tackle to deny the Portugal winger a clear sight of goal.
We're into five minutes of additional time before the break, with Luton still on the attack. Gomes' foul on Kabore gives the Hatters a set-piece chance from the right flank.
Gomes clearly won the ball with that challenge, but the referee opts to show the midfielder a yellow card.
The Wolves defence stands firm to clear from the free-kick. Luton keep the attack alive as Doughty delivers from the left, but Ait-Nouri clears with a fine defensive header.
Neto fouls Bell in the Luton left-back position. This has been such a frustrating 45 minutes for the visitors, and they need to keep cool heads.
Luton win another corner, which Lokonga swings straight out of play. Wolves look to have done enough to reach half-time still level.
HALF-TIME: LUTON TOWN 0-0 WOLVES.
It's still goalless as we reach the interval at Kenilworth Road, and what a chance this could be for Luton to get off the mark! The Hatters pushed Wolves back from the off and went close to a spectacular opener when Morris struck the post from range. Just as the visitors looked to be taking control of the match, Bellegarde was shown a straight red card for a mindless kick on Lockyer! Wolves have it all to do from here, and Luton will surely smell blood!
Wolves are yet to manage a shot at goal here, with Luton trying their luck nine times but only hitting the target twice. This could be a long second half for O'Neil's men, who need a rethink after struggling to contain their physically imposing hosts.
With Wolves a man down and struggling, O'Neil turns to his bench at the break. Doherty is on for Ait-Nouri.
Hwang, meanwhile, is replaced by Toti. Those changes will surely mean a change of shape for the visitors, perhaps to a back three.
We're back under way for the second half as Cunha gets the ball rolling for Wolves. Can the 10-man visitors find a way to pose a threat?
Luton come forward through Burke, who cuts inside and sees his shot smothered by Kilman's block. There's a half-hearted handball appeal from the hosts, but the referee shakes his head.
GOOD SAVE! Semedo gifts possession to Morris with a dreadful pass, and the striker waits for Ogbene to arrive with an overlapping run before picking him out. Ogbene returns the favour with a chipped cross, and Morris' header is parried and eventually held by Sa.
GOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLL! NETO PUTS WOLVES AHEAD! The 10 men have the lead, and what a brilliant solo goal it is from Neto! The in-form winger beats Lockyer to Gomes' pass before cutting inside from the right and blasting his finish beyond Kaminski! 1-0 Wolves!
That is a hammer blow for Luton, who have been well on top and were looking to press their numerical advantage home. Wolves score from their first shot of the game!
Luton win a free-kick on the right and work it infield for Nakamba. The midfielder looks to stand up a cross to the far post, but it drifts harmlessly out of play.
Brown battles with Toti and sends his opponent tumbling inside the Wolves box before winning a corner off him.
Doughty's corner is headed away by Semedo. Morris picks it up on the opposite flank and throws himself to ground under pressure from Toti. He wants a free-kick, but the referee says no.
Wolves only managed three touches in Luton's area before the break, but their fourth of the match resulted in Neto's opening goal. Can they hold on?
Neto is enjoying himself now. He turns Bell inside-out, beating him three times before the Luton man grows impatient and hauls him down. Wolves have a free-kick out wide on the right.
Mpanzu replaces Lokonga as Luton make their first substitution of the match.
DOUBLE SAVE! Neto swings the free-kick towards the back post, where Lemina stretches to meet it with a diving header. Kaminski is only able to parry his bouncing effort, then the Luton goalkeeper reacts well to smother Kilman's shot on the rebound. Wolves could have been 2-0 up!
Wolves are unbeaten in their last seven league games against Luton (W4 D3), winning the last three in a row. This is their first such meeting since a 3-2 win at Kenilworth Road in March 2007. Current Luton boss Edwards started at right-back for Wolves on that day.
Over! Luton threaten as Mpanzu threads a neat pass into Morris' feet, only for Kilman to step in with a crucial intervention. The ball drops kindly for Doughty, who flashes his effort just over the bar!
Wolves have been playing with a back three since making their half-time changes, with Toti joining Dawson and Kilman in the backline. Semedo is at right wing-back, with Doherty taking up an unfamiliar left wing-back role.
PENALTY LUTON! Brown picks out Kabore on the overlap, and the Luton right wing-back checks inside before shooting. The ball strikes Gomes on his outstretched arm, and the referee immediately points to the spot! There will be a VAR check, however, as the ball struck Gomes' foot first!
CHECK COMPLETE, THE PENALTY STANDS! The ball hit Gomes' foot before bouncing onto his hand, but with his arm in an unnatural position, the spot-kick stands! Morris has a huge chance to level this match…
GOOOOAAAAAAAAAL! MORRIS SCORES! The Luton striker shows great composure to send Sa the wrong way, rolling the spot-kick into the bottom-left corner! It's 1-1, and now Luton will be looking to win it!
The Kenilworth Road crowd are up for this now! Ogbene gets away from Dawson on the left before seeing his cross deflect behind for a corner!
Big chance! The corner is delivered through the crowd and finds Nakamba peeling away to the penalty spot, but the midfielder completely mishits his volley and it drops wide.
The momentum is with Luton now, with Wolves unable to keep hold of the ball. Neto sees an appeal for a free-kick turned down before Ogbene leads a Luton break, eventually seeing a shot deflect wide off Dawson.
Luton fail to make anything of their latest corner, but they retain possession inside the Wolves half through Mpanzu. Kilman gets under his left-wing cross to head it clear.
Well, this is a surprising change from O'Neil. Traore replaces Cunha in a switch that leaves Wolves without a recognised forward. He clearly sees a need for more legs in midfield.
Edwards responds with two substitutions of his own. Giles is on for Doughty on the left.
Woodrow, meanwhile, takes Brown's place in attack.
Heading into matchday six, only Aston Villa's Lucas Digne (32) and Wolves star Neto (25) had attempted more open-play crosses than Giles (19) in the Premier League.
Lemina stays down following a coming together with Morris, who caught the Wolves man with a flailing arm. There's a swift VAR check, but the contact from Morris was unintentional. Giles then delivers a left-wing free-kick, but Sa is able to claim the second ball.
Wolves haven't had an attack of any kind since Neto opened the scoring. Doherty attempts to get something going down the left, but his shove on Kabore grants Luton a free-kick.
Traore does brilliantly to get Wolves moving forward with little support. Semedo then tries to link up with Neto, but the attack breaks down.
Wolves are effectively playing 5-3-1 now, with Neto the only recognised attacking player left on the pitch for the visitors.
Luton's players are incandescent with rage as Nakamba is penalised for a challenge on Lemina. The Wolves man had overdone it inside his own half, and had the foul not been awarded, the Hatters were away.
We're into the final 10 minutes of the 90 here with the Kenilworth Road crowd urging Luton forwards. Will there be another twist?
Luton win a corner, which Giles swings towards the near post. Dawson is there to clear before Neto attempts to break, but he's all alone and is swiftly crowded out inside the Luton half.
Gomes does well to dispossess Kabore before winning a free-kick inside his own half. Wolves are about to turn to their bench again.
Hugo Bueno replaces Semedo and heads over to the left. Doherty will end the game at right wing-back.
Bueno is tested immediately as Kabore beats him for pace down the Luton right. The young Spaniard has to block the cross behind for another Hatters corner.
Kabore is withdrawn ahead of the corner being taken, with Adebayo on in an attacking change from Edwards.
Danger! Giles' delivery causes a scramble in the area as Burke puts Sa under pressure. His punch is weak, and Traore has to clear in acrobatic fashion. Luton then come again through Mpanzu, but his awkward effort flies well over the crossbar.
Woodrow pulls wide to cross into the area, but Lockyer sends his header well over Sa's crossbar. We're into the final two minutes of the 90, with Luton the only team offering anything as an attacking force.
GOOOAAAAAALLL, BUT WAIT, THE FLAG IS UP! Luton think they have a winner as Mpanzu's shot deflects off a blue shirt and lands kindly for Ogbene, who tucks his left-footed finish past Sa. The flag is quickly raised, however, and a VAR check confirms the Luton man went too early!
O'Neil makes another change as Doyle replaces Gomes in the Wolves midfield.
We're into SIX added minutes at the end of this game! There could be more than that, however, with Neto currently down after being caught in the face.
Neto is still receiving treatment, lying down on the turf. Wolves will be happy to take the sting out of this game.
Neto is back up and Luton can get the game restarted. They're still looking for a late winner!
OVER! Sa comes for a cross and drops it under pressure from Adebayo. The ball falls for Woodrow, who looks to lift his effort over three Wolves defenders on the goal line, but it drops onto the roof of the net.
Ogbene cuts inside before swinging a cross towards the far post, but Doherty does well to shield the ball away from Giles and behind.
Lemina goes into the book for a heavy challenge on halfway.
Luton keep Wolves penned back, working the ball down the right. It's cut back towards Woodrow, who shoots first time… but Traore deflects it behind for a late corner!
Giles' corner is cleared at the near post, but Neto fails to make any headway on the counter-attack. Do Luton have time to create one last chance?
FULL-TIME: LUTON TOWN 1-1 WOLVES.
The full-time whistle sounds at Kenilworth Road, and while Luton have their first point as a Premier League club, they may well see this 1-1 draw as a missed opportunity! The Hatters played over 50 minutes with a numerical advantage after Bellegarde was dismissed for a petulant kick, but they failed to make the most of their dominance. Wolves threatened to take all three points when Neto scored a brilliant solo goal on the break, but Luton hit back through Morris' penalty. Wolves will feel aggrieved by the award of that spot-kick, with the ball striking Gomes' foot before deflecting onto his hand.
Luton remain bottom of the pile with a single point to their name, though they will go above Burnley if the Clarets lose to Manchester United in Saturday's late kick-off. Wolves, meanwhile, jump above Bournemouth into 15th place with four points from six matches. After their midweek EFL Cup exertions, Luton visit Everton and Wolves host champions Manchester City!
We hope you've enjoyed our coverage of this hard-fought Premier League fixture. Until next time, it's goodbye from us!"	"Lewis Dunk's second-half goal stopped Liverpool from going second in the table as they drew 2-2 at Brighton & Hove Albion. 
Mohamed Salah scored twice to turn the match around after Simon Adingra's wonderful Brighton opener, but Dunk's goal from Solly March's free-kick ensured a share of the points."	Team_5	Team_11	"[""Hello and welcome to our live coverage of this Premier League clash as Team_12 face Team_20 at Kenilworth Road!\nWe've got an early-season six-pointer for you here as Luton face Team_20. The hosts are the only Premier League side still seeking their first point of the season ahead of matchday six, after Team_6 claimed a draw at Team_16 on Monday. Rob Edwards' Hatters could become the sixth team in Premier League history to start a season with five straight defeats – three of the previous five finished bottom of the table.\nThere have been plenty of positives for Gary O'Neil to take from Team_20' early-season showings, but last week's 3-1 defeat to Team_11 left them with three points from their first five matches of the Premier League season. The likes of Pedro Neto, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde and Joao Gomes impressed against the Reds, but Team_20 ran out of steam in the second half after taking an early lead. O'Neil will be aware of the need to turn encouraging performances into results, particularly against their fellow strugglers.\nTeam_12 (5-2-3): Thomas Kaminski; Issa Kabore, Reece Burke, Tom Lockyer, Amari'i Bell, Alfie Doughty; Marvelous Nakamba, Albert Sambi Lokonga; Jacob Brown, Carlton Morris, Chiedozie Ogbene.\nTeam_12 SUBS: Tim Krul, Mads Andersen, Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Elijah Adebayo, Tahith Chong, Teden Mengi, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Ryan Giles.\nTeam_20 (4-2-3-1): Jose Sa; Nelson Semedo, Maximilian Kilman, Craig Dawson, Rayan Ait-Nouri; Joao Gomes, Mario Lemina; Hwang Hee-chan, Jean-Ricner Bellegarde, Pedro Neto; Matheus Cunha.\nTeam_20 SUBS: Dan Bentley, Matt Doherty, Boubacar Traore, Fabio Silva, Hugo Bueno, Sasa Kalajdzic, Tommy Doyle, Pablo Sarabia, Toti Gomes.\nEdwards makes two changes to the team that started last week's defeat at Team_10. Ross Barkley is still absent due to a hamstring injury, while Andersen and Chong drop to the bench. Ogbene and Doughty come in, with former Team_20 wing-back Giles among the substitutes again.\nTeam_20, meanwhile, are unchanged from last week's 3-1 loss to Team_11. O'Neil's men started that game at breakneck speed\xa0and it will be interesting to see whether they can maintain that intensity against less-fancied opponents. Neto leads the Premier League charts for assists (four) and chances created (17) this campaign and should offer a direct outlet on the visitors' left flank.\nLuton are just the second team to lose their first four\xa0games as a Premier League club, along with Swindon Town in 1993, who drew 0-0 at Norwich City in their fifth game. Can the Hatters get their campaign up and running here? Kick-off is approaching and we're about to find out!\nWe're under way for just the second Premier League game to be played at Kenilworth Road! The hosts get us going and go long straight away, but the ball is quickly with Sa.\nAs you would\xa0expect, there's a fantastic atmosphere here. Luton win a free-kick out wide on the right as Ait-Nouri brings Ogbene down. They'll look to lift this into the Team_20 area.\nIt's played short to Doughty, but his left-footed strike is straight into the wall before Brown sees a cross blocked by Semedo.\nGomes goes down after being caught in midfield, but the Brazilian is swiftly back to his feet. It's been a scrappy, high-octane start, which Luton won't mind one bit! They'll be keen to turn this contest into a physical battle.\nChance! Ogbene gets down the left to swing a cross into Team_20' area. His delivery is over Morris and Brown is attacking it at the far post, but Ait-Nouri does brilliantly to nod it behind his own goal.\nLuton fail to make anything of the game's\xa0first corner before Bell sees his second delivery blocked. They've done a good job of penning Team_20 back early on, however.\nTeam_20 are struggling here! Sa flaps at Bell's deep cross, but there is no orange shirt there to attack the loose ball. Hwang then looks to break, but he runs it straight out of play on the visitors' left!\nTeam_20 – donning their sky blue third kit – come forward for the first time, but Hwang is caught offside from Ait-Nouri's ball in behind.\nOFF THE POST! Luton go so close to the opener! Morris latches onto a loose ball 20 yards from goal before shifting it\xa0onto his right foot. His curling, long-range effort has Sa beaten, but it bounces off the upright and the visitors can clear!\nLuton are the Premier League's joint-lowest scorers with two goals (alongside Team_9), while only Team_6 (12) and Team_20 (11) have conceded more than their 10 goals against, even though the Hatters have only played four matches. They have made an impressive start to this game, however.\nThis is a concerning moment for Team_20. Sa has gone down in the goalmouth, holding his left foot and appearing to be in some discomfort. He needs to receive treatment, though the home fans are not particularly sympathetic.\nSa is back on\xa0his feet and looks set to continue for now.\nLuton are quick to drop into a 5-2-3 shape whenever they lose the ball. Team_20 are struggling to get the likes of Cunha, Bellegarde and Neto involved on a regular basis – Neto has only had one touch.\nLuton threaten down the left once again as Doughty finds space for a cross. He hangs it up towards Brown at the far post, but his header is straight at Sa. It's been one-way traffic so far!\nBlocked by his own team-mate! Brown finds space for a shot just inside the area, but Morris gets in the way of his effort! Doughty then wins – and takes – a free-kick on the left, which Brown glances comfortably over the crossbar.\nLuton have managed seven shots to Team_20' zero so far, though the Hatters have only hit the target once. They need to make this spell of sustained pressure count. Lemina concedes a corner on the Luton left.\nThe corner is cleared by the first defender, and a scrappy passage of play ends with Team_20 receiving a goal-kick. The visitors have appeared rattled by Luton's physicality early on.\nHwang goes down following a tussle with Bell on halfway, claiming he was caught in the face. There was contact, but it was certainly accidental.\nNeto finally gets a chance to run at Kabore. He beats the right wing-back\xa0with ease before flashing a cross across the face of goal, but there are no blue shirts attacking it.\nThis is the first top-flight meeting between Luton and Team_20 since the 1983-84 campaign, with the Hatters winning home (4-0) and away (2-1) games against Team_20 that season, when the Molineux men went on to finish bottom.\nCunha finds Neto out wide to start a Team_20 break, and the winger plays it left to Ait-Nouri. The left-back sees his cutback turned behind for a corner, from which Brown stands firm to clear.\nBellegarde swings a right-footed delivery towards the far post, where Morris decides to let it run. He hadn't seen Kilman lurking behind him, but the Team_20 captain is unable to keep it alive.\nTeam_20 have settled down and are enjoying more time on the ball as we pass the half-hour mark, but they are yet to trouble Kaminski in the Luton goal.\nTeam_20 are enjoying a sustained spell of\xa0possession inside Luton's half now, but that Hatters block continues to stand firm and deny the visitors space.\nThe referee halts play as both Kabore and Brown are left in a heap. Brown looks to have been caught on the top of the head by Kilman, while Kabore is holding his leg. Both men require treatment.\nBoth teams take the opportunity to receive instructions from the managers, before Team_20 restart the game with a drop-ball. Brown and Kabore are both able to continue.\nTeam_20 are still yet to record a shot of any kind in this match, though they are beginning to exercise some control in midfield as Gomes is fouled by Lokonga.\nRED CARD FOR BELLEGARDE! Team_20 ARE DOWN TO 10 MEN! Lockyer and Bellegarde tussle for the ball and both men go down. Caught between the Luton man's legs, Bellegarde looks to escape and kicks out at the Hatters' defender. The referee calls the play back and issues a red card!\nThere's a VAR review to check whether Bellegarde's kick warranted a straight red card, but the on-field decision is swiftly confirmed! The Team_20 man might feel hard done by as he was looking to escape a tangle of legs, but you can't lash out like that!\nO'Neil will be absolutely furious. Just as Team_20 were beginning to take control of the contest, they pick up a straight red card. It's going to be a long 50 minutes or so for the visitors now!\nWHAT A LET-OFF FOR Team_20! Dawson plays a no-look pass back towards his own goal, not realising Sa had moved off his line! Brown is looking to turn the ball into an unguarded net, but Kilman gets back to clear!\nLemina's quick free-kick almost gets Neto in behind, but Lockyer gets back with a huge tackle to deny the Portugal winger a clear sight of goal.\nWe're into five minutes of additional time before the break, with Luton still on the attack. Gomes' foul on Kabore gives the Hatters a set-piece chance from the right flank.\nGomes clearly won the ball with that challenge, but the referee opts to show the midfielder a yellow card.\nThe Team_20 defence stands firm to clear from the free-kick. Luton keep the attack alive as Doughty delivers from the left, but Ait-Nouri clears with a fine defensive header.\nNeto fouls Bell in the Luton left-back position. This has been such a frustrating 45 minutes for the visitors, and they need to keep cool heads.\nLuton win another corner, which Lokonga swings straight out of play. Team_20 look to have done enough to reach half-time still level.\nHALF-TIME: Team_12 0-0 Team_20.\nIt's still goalless as we reach the interval at Kenilworth Road, and what a chance this could be for Luton to get off the mark! The Hatters pushed Team_20 back from the off and went close to a spectacular opener when Morris struck the post from range. Just as the visitors looked to be taking control of the match, Bellegarde was shown a straight red card for a mindless kick on Lockyer! Team_20 have it all to do from here, and Luton will surely smell blood!\nTeam_20 are yet to manage a shot at goal here, with Luton trying their luck nine times but only hitting the target twice. This could be a long second half for O'Neil's men, who need a rethink after struggling to contain their physically imposing hosts.\nWith Team_20 a man down and struggling, O'Neil turns to his bench at the break. Doherty is on for Ait-Nouri.\nHwang, meanwhile, is replaced by Toti. Those changes will surely mean a change of shape for the visitors, perhaps to a back three.\nWe're back under way for the second half as Cunha gets the ball rolling for Team_20. Can the 10-man visitors find a way to pose a threat?\nLuton come forward through Burke, who cuts inside and sees his shot smothered by Kilman's block. There's a half-hearted handball appeal from the hosts, but the referee shakes his head.\nGOOD SAVE! Semedo gifts possession to Morris with a dreadful pass, and the striker waits for Ogbene to arrive with an overlapping run before picking him out. Ogbene returns the favour with a chipped cross, and Morris' header is parried and eventually held by Sa.\nGOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAALLLLL! NETO PUTS Team_20 AHEAD! The 10 men have the lead, and what a brilliant solo goal it is from Neto! The in-form winger beats Lockyer to Gomes' pass before cutting inside from the right and blasting his finish beyond Kaminski! 1-0 Team_20!\nThat is a hammer blow for Luton, who have been well on top and were looking to press their numerical advantage home. Team_20 score from their first shot of the game!\nLuton win a free-kick on the right and work it infield for Nakamba. The midfielder looks to stand up a cross to the far post, but it drifts harmlessly out of play.\nBrown battles with Toti and sends his opponent\xa0tumbling inside the Team_20 box before winning a corner off him.\nDoughty's corner is headed away by Semedo. Morris picks it up on the opposite flank and throws himself to ground under pressure from Toti. He wants a free-kick, but the referee says no.\nTeam_20 only managed three touches in Luton's area before the break, but their fourth of the match resulted in Neto's opening goal. Can they hold on?\nNeto is enjoying himself now. He turns Bell inside-out, beating him three times before the Luton man grows impatient and hauls him down. Team_20 have a free-kick out wide on the right.\nMpanzu replaces Lokonga as Luton make their first substitution of the match.\nDOUBLE SAVE! Neto swings the free-kick towards the back post, where Lemina stretches to meet it with a diving header. Kaminski is only able to parry his bouncing effort, then\xa0the Luton goalkeeper reacts well to smother Kilman's shot on the rebound. Team_20 could have been 2-0 up!\nTeam_20 are unbeaten in their last seven league games against Luton (W4 D3), winning the last three in a row. This is their first such meeting since a 3-2 win at Kenilworth Road in March 2007. Current Luton boss Edwards started at right-back for Team_20 on that day.\nOver! Luton threaten as Mpanzu threads a neat pass into Morris' feet, only for Kilman to step in with a crucial intervention. The ball drops kindly for Doughty, who flashes his effort just over the bar!\nTeam_20 have been playing with a back three since making their half-time changes, with Toti joining Dawson and Kilman in the backline. Semedo is at right wing-back, with Doherty taking up an unfamiliar left wing-back role.\nPENALTY LUTON! Brown picks out Kabore on the overlap, and the Luton right wing-back checks inside before shooting. The ball strikes Gomes on his outstretched arm, and the referee immediately points to the spot! There will be a VAR check, however, as the ball struck Gomes' foot first!\nCHECK COMPLETE, THE PENALTY STANDS! The ball hit Gomes' foot before bouncing onto his hand, but with his arm in an unnatural position, the spot-kick stands! Morris has a huge chance to level this match…\nGOOOOAAAAAAAAAL! MORRIS SCORES! The Luton striker shows great composure to send Sa the wrong way, rolling the spot-kick into the bottom-left corner! It's 1-1, and now Luton will be looking to win it!\nThe Kenilworth Road crowd are up for this now! Ogbene gets away from Dawson on the left before seeing his cross deflect behind for a corner!\nBig chance! The corner is delivered through the crowd and finds Nakamba peeling away to the penalty spot, but the midfielder completely mishits his volley and it drops wide.\nThe momentum is with Luton now, with Team_20 unable to keep hold of the ball. Neto sees\xa0an appeal for a free-kick turned down before Ogbene leads a Luton break, eventually seeing a shot deflect wide off Dawson.\nLuton fail to make anything of their latest corner, but they retain possession inside the Team_20 half through Mpanzu. Kilman gets under his left-wing cross to head it clear.\nWell, this is a surprising change from O'Neil. Traore replaces Cunha in a switch that leaves Team_20 without a recognised forward. He clearly sees a need for more legs in midfield.\nEdwards responds with two substitutions of his own. Giles is on for Doughty on the left.\nWoodrow, meanwhile, takes Brown's place in attack.\nHeading into matchday six, only Team_2 Lucas Digne (32) and Team_20 star Neto (25) had attempted more open-play crosses than Giles (19) in the Premier League.\nLemina stays down following a coming together with Morris, who caught the Team_20 man with a flailing arm. There's a swift VAR check, but the contact from Morris was unintentional. Giles then delivers a left-wing free-kick, but Sa is able to claim the second ball.\nTeam_20 haven't had an attack of any kind since Neto opened the scoring. Doherty attempts to get something going down the left, but his shove on Kabore grants Luton a free-kick.\nTraore does brilliantly to get Team_20 moving forward with little support. Semedo then tries to link up with Neto, but the attack breaks down.\nTeam_20 are effectively playing 5-3-1 now, with Neto the only recognised attacking player left on the pitch for the visitors.\nLuton's players are incandescent with rage as Nakamba is penalised for a challenge on Lemina.

93478	Sheffield Utd	Brentford	2023-12-09	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	28509.0	Stuart Attwell	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Chelsea and Brighton at Stamford Bridge!
With an upturn in form, things had started to look up for Chelsea in recent weeks. Going into last weekend, they'd lost just one of eight games in competitions (W5 D2), with that run including a 1-0 win over Brighton in the EFL Cup in late September. They followed it up last weekend with a heavy 4-1 defeat at Newcastle United. Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping his team can bounce back today and turn around their home form as they've won just one of their last 14 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge which came against promoted Luton Town (3-0).
Brighton come into today on the back of a midweek high having secured their place in the knockout rounds of the Europa League with a 1-0 win over AEK Athens on Thursday. They also ended a run of six without a win in the Premier League last weekend after holding on for a 3-2 over Nottingham Forest. They've enjoyed success in the league against Chelsea in recent years, going unbeaten against them in their last five such meetings (W2 D3), including doing the double over them last season.
CHELSEA STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez; Axel Disasi, Beniot Badiashile, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo; Raheem Sterling, Conor Gallagher, Mykhailo Mudryk; Nicolas Jackson.
CHELSEA SUBS: Lucas Bergstrom, Alfie Gilchrist, Alex Matos, Deivid Washington, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Armando Broja, Ian Maatsen, Dorde Petrovic.
BRIGHTON STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Jason Steele; Joel Veltman, Jan-Paul van Hecke, Igor Julio, Jack Hinshelwood; Carlos Baleba, Billy Gilmour; Facundo Buonanotte, Adam Lallana, Simon Adingra; Evan Ferguson.
BRIGHTON SUBS: Mark O'Mahony, James Milner, Kaoru Mitoma, Benicio Baker-Boaitey, Bart Verbruggen, Joao Pedro, Jakub Moder, Leigh Kavanagh, Pascal Gross.
Pochettino makes four changes from the loss to Newcastle last Saturday, as Disasi, Colwill, Caicedo and Mudryk all come into the side. Reece James was sent off in that game, while Marc Cucurella picked up his fifth booking of the season, so they're both suspended. Palmer drops to the bench, while Lesley Ugochukwu isn't in the squad.
Roberto De Zerbi makes five changes to his team after their win over AEK Athens on Thursday. Steele starts in goal, with Van Hecke, Baleba, Buonanotte and Lallana also being brought in. Verbruggen, Gross, Mitoma and Pedro start on the bench, while Lewis Dunk serves the first game of his suspension after being sent off against Forest last weekend.
The teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!
Jackson gets the game under way for Chelsea!
Brighton do well to win it back in midfield and quickly counter, though Adingra can't get into the box. Ferguson is nudged off the ball by Badiashile, but it rolls towards Adingra again, who is wiped out by Sanchez. After a quick VAR check, there's no penalty.
Brighton have made a bright start to this game and they're putting Chelsea under some early pressure. Veltman links up well with Buonanotte down the right, but Silva reacts quickly to stop him from cutting inside.
It's better from Chelsea here as Sterling holds off Hinshelwood long enough to play a reverse pass down the left for Jackson. He isn't strong enough though, and Julio is able to clear the danger for Brighton.
Gallagher sweeps it out to Sterling, who plays a one-two with Jackson to lose his marker so he can square a low cross into the box. He's looking for Mudryk at the far post, but doesn't get enough on it, and Baleba intercepts.
Brighton have failed to score in eight of their 10 away games against Chelsea in all competitions, including a 1-0 defeat already this season in the EFL Cup.
Chelsea do well to pass it out from the back around Brighton's high press, but Sterling is tripped by Hinshelwood to win a free-kick. The Blues take it short, but it comes to nothing as Mudryk loses the ball when it gets to him.
Brighton are struggling to keep hold of the ball in the final third, with their attacks fizzling out and turning into Chelsea breaks. Sterling leads the latest charge and has options ahead of him, but can't pick any of them out.
Sterling makes another surging run down the right, and he has the beating of Hinshelwood once more. He loops a cross into the far post, but it's just behind Mudryk.
FERNANDEZ SCORES! Brighton are caught out from a corner, which is swung deep into Badiashile at the far post by Gallagher. He has Hinshelwood tight to him as well as his back to goal, but he improvises, volleying it over his shoulder. Fernandez is unmarked at the far post, and he nods in from close range. 1-0 Chelsea!
It's good work by Badiashile, who could've looked to Mudryk, who was making a supporting run down the left. Instead, he picks out a good cross himself.
BLOCK! Brighton just can't get out of their own half at the moment, and Jackson's darting run down the left has the visitors scrambling back into their box. He clips it in from the byline, but Van Hecke blocks it just ahead of Fernandez.
CHANCE! Chelsea have the feel for it now, and it's back with Sterling down the right side. He fizzes a low cross into the six-yard box, but Baleba slides in to deflect it just wide of the near post.
COLWILL SCORES! It's another corner that has Brighton scrambling, and again, it's swung deep to the far post. Jackson peels away from Julio to nod it back into the mix and Colwill rises highest to thump a header on goal. It originally looks like Gilmour manages to clear it off the line, but the referee's watch buzzes, and the Brighton midfielder didn't do it in time. 2-0 Chelsea!
Julio couldn't even get off the floor as the corner was hung into the far post, but Jackson was alert and backpedalled to head it back into the crowd in the six-yard box.
De Zerbi is pacing in his technical area, and he'll have concerns about how those two goals were conceded. Brighton are pushing upfield at the moment, but they don't seem to know what to do when they get into the final third.
Adingra wins a free-kick through the middle and Gilmour clips it into the box. Silva only half clears it, but Hinshelwood rushes in to try and keep it alive, only to lift it out of play under pressure from Caicedo.
There's a very nervy moment at the back for Chelsea as Sanchez is far too casual when Fernandez knocks it back to him. The ball skims off his foot and rolls towards his net, but the keeper reacts quickly to prevent the own goal.
Colwill makes a driving run through midfield and Van Hecke tries to block the path, getting a kick in the process. He stays down, but gets back to his feet after a little while without needing treatment.
Gallagher is late getting across to Buonanotte and crashes into the youngster with a clumsy challenge. He picks up the first booking of the game.
Gallagher gives away another free-kick in midfield, and Gilmour lifts it long into the box once more. It's another comfortable clearance for Chelsea though, who look very at ease in this game.
Chelsea look like they want it more in midfield, and their high press is causing Brighton all sorts of problems. Fernandez turns possession over once more, only to overhit the throughball into Jackson.
Lallana is a little sloppy with his first-time pass into Baleba, and Jackson is sniffing around him. The Chelsea forward threatens to break, but Baleba recovers well to stop him from getting over the halfway line.
Chelsea almost get over-confident playing out from the back, and Fernandez is caught on the ball inside his own box. He just about manages to poke it back to Sanchez, who gets lucky that his own pass out to Disasi isn't cut out by Lallana.
WIDE! Mudryk gets away from Veltman with a lovely turn before bursting forward to the edge of the box. He has a quick glance up before fizzing a pacy low shot just wide of the far post.
Brighton have won a lot of similarly positioned free-kicks in midfield, but they haven't been able to take advantage of them. Buonanotte takes this one, but just like Gilmour before him, he can't pick out a team-mate in the area.
BUONANOTTE PULLS ONE BACK! And what a way to do it! Adingra stretches to keep the ball for Brighton, and Lallana just as quickly helps it onto Buonanotte. He checks back, wrongfooting Colwill, before curling a delightful strike out of Sanchez's reach and into the far side of the net. 2-1!
Lallana has space and time, but he chooses to get it out of his feet quickly to give Buonanotte a better chance.
WHAT A SAVE! Straight from the restart, Chelsea want to restore their two-goal cushion and Mudryk surges down the left before sending his cross into the box. It deflects off Julio's trailing leg, and Steele is at full stretch to tip it away.
GALLAGHER IS OFF! After such a strong start to the game, things are going downhill for Chelsea! Gilmour was racing away through the middle and Gallagher made up a lot of ground to get to him. The ball is already out of his reach, and he clumsily brings down the Scotsman. It earns him his second yellow card, and for the second game in a row, Chelsea are down to 10 men!
Unsurprisingly, that red card has just tipped the momentum in Brighton's favour and they're putting Chelsea under pressure already. The Seagulls are pushing numbers forward and manage to win a corner out of it, but it comes to nothing.
Chelsea clear their lines after Brighton's latest attack, and Sterling has space to run down the right. He plays it into Fernandez, continuing down the wing, only to stray offside when it comes to him.
WIDE! Ferguson peels out to the left and drops a shoulder to wrongfoot Disasi before fizzing a low shot on goal from a long way out. A touch from one of his team-mates would've taken it past Sanchez, but instead, it rolls wide of the far post.
Hinshelwood has been struggling to cope with Sterling's threat down the right, and he just nudges the winger off the ball this time, picking up a yellow card.
HALF-TIME: CHELSEA 2-1 BRIGHTON.
Chelsea take a 2-1 lead over Brighton into half-time, but face a tough second half with only 10 men. It was a perfect start for the Blues, who dominated for most of the first half. It was two corners that caught out Brighton, with Fernandez heading in his first-ever Premier League goal from close range, before Colwill netted his first Chelsea goal with a thumping header. The Seagulls started to grow into the game, and Buonanotte pulled one back with a wonderful curling finish before Steele pulled off a marvellous save at the other end. The Chelsea captain, Gallagher, was then sent off for his second yellow card offence.
Pochettino won't be able to believe what's happened - his side looked to be in total control, but within two minutes at the end of the half, things flipped on their head. He knows it won't be easy to protect a lead against this Brighton side, especially with 10 men. De Zerbi won't be happy about the goals they conceded, but he can have no complaints about how they reacted. He'll know this game is there for the taking in the second half.
Brighton get us back under way for the second half!
Andingra weaves this way and that, only to overrun the ball out of play at the byline. Sanchez goes long from the resulting free-kick to pick out Sterling, but Van Hecke brilliantly cuts out his throughball into Jackson.
Brighton have started the second half on the front foot and are pushing Chelsea back into their own half. Baleba is allowed to carry the ball a long way, and decides to try his luck from range, but Sanchez gets down to hold it.
Caicedo steps across Ferguson to stop his run and immediately protests against the free-kick. His reaction gets him a booking for dissent.
Fernandez has scored his first Premier League goal in his 31st appearance and from his 43rd shot in the competition. Before today. he'd attempted more shots than any player without a goal in the competition this season (22).
CHANCE! Buonanotte's header is blocked for a corner, and Chelsea can't clear their lines from the resulting set-piece. Adingra hangs in a cross for Lallana, who spins and scuffs a volley on goal, but he sends it wide.
De Zerbi is making a quadruple change as his side continue to search for an equaliser. Buonanotte has had a good game, and he goes off for Mitoma.
Hinshelwood, on the other hand, has struggled at times up against Sterling, and he's replaced by Milner.
And Gross gets the captain's armband as he's brought on for Baleba.
Julio catches Mudryk with a late foul as he tries to stop him from breaking, and he goes into the book.
Lallana is also taken off, with Pedro on for him.
Fernandez isn't happy when a Brighton player isn't booked for a challenge on Caicedo. He picks up his own yellow card for dissent.
PENALTY? Jackson's layoff to Mudryk is perfectly-weighted, but his first touch shows too much of it to Milner. He nudges the Ukrainian out of the way to see it back to Steele, and Chelsea are claiming they should have a spot-kick.
After a long look at all of the angles, the referee is asked to go over to the monitor to have another look at the incident. At first, it looked like Milner just nudged Mudryk off the ball, but he was clumsy, clipping the Ukrainian's heels, and he could be in trouble.
PENALTY TO CHELSEA! After having another look at the incident, referee Craig Pawson comes back onto the pitch, and much to Chelsea's delight, points to the spot!
Gross is protesting Milner's innocence for him, and the Brighton captain talks his way into a booking.
Milner is also shown a yellow card for his challenge on Mudryk that led to the penalty.
FERNANDEZ SCORES AGAIN! After a long wait for a Premier League goal, the Argentinian now has two in one game! He had the ball in his hands before the penalty was awarded and coolly steps up now. He takes a long run-up before stroking it down the right side of the goal, leaving Steele no chance as he dives the wrong way. 3-1 Chelsea!
Pochettino is making his first change of the game now that the two-goal cushion is restored. Sterling is taken off, with Palmer on for him.
Brighton are still throwing bodies forward in an attempt to cut the scoreline down once more. Adingra is afforded so much space down the right, and sees Mitoma in a similar position on the left, but he overhits the cross.
Adingra's latest cross is blocked by Badiashile, and Pedro keeps it alive, though he fouls Fernandez in the process. The referee doesn't immediately award the foul, so Gilmour takes aim from range, but it's blocked by Silva.
Chelsea are making another change here. Jackson, who only managed one shot in this game, and he's replaced by Maatsen.
Brighton are dominating possession at the moment, but they're still struggling to get in behind Chelsea. The Seagulls are trying to use their wide players, with Gross threading it forward for Pedro, but he's caught on his heels.
Again, Brighton have numbers in the box, but they can't make them count. Adingra chooses to go short instead of curling a cross into the crowd, and his pull back to Gilmour is cleared by Fernandez.
After soaking up Brighton's pressure, Chelsea move it upfield quickly, with Palmer picking out Caicedo in space just outside the D. He takes aim from distance, but doesn't trouble Steele as he fires it over.
CHANCE! It looks like the chance is gone for Brighton when Gross lets it run, but Pedro just about manages to keep it alive. He spreads it out to Milner on the left, who picks out Adingra at the far post, but his header is so poor, he picks out the substitute once more.
Mudryk went down, and after a quick bit of treatment, Pochettino decides not to take a risk. He's taken off, with Broja on in his place.
Mitoma is starting to impose himself down the left a little more now, and he holds off Disasi as he makes another bursting run down the left. He picks out Pedro at the far post, but his thumping header is straight at Sanchez.
Brighton's final roll of the dice sees 19-year-old Baker-Boaitey come on in place of Julio.
SAVE! Fernandez just steps on Pedro's foot, and even though it's soft, Brighton have a free-kick in a good position. Gross curls his shot over the wall, but Sanchez has it covered as he holds onto it.
Ferguson gets the ball caught under his feet, but Silva can't get enough on his clearance. It bobbles out to Gross on the edge of the box, but his low shot is held by Sanchez again.
Sanchez is starting to dawdle on the ball, and the referee has had enough as he books him for time-wasting.
GREAT SAVE! Brighton are flooding forward into Chelsea's box, but Gross decides to have another go from range. He curls his shot through the crowd and it's sneaking into the far post until Sanchez tips it wide.
WIDE! Into the first of 10 added minutes here and the corner is whipped into the box. Chelsea have practically everyone back in their box, and Silva just manages to get in the way of Pedro's header to give away another corner.
PEDRO PULLS ANOTHER ONE BACK! Brighton's pressure finally pays off! It's a great delivery from Milner on the corner and he clips it into the near post, where Pedro rises highest. He flicks his header on, and Sanchez has no chance as it skims into the far side of his net. 3-2, but can Brighton get another one with eight minutes still to go?
It's the best delivery that Brighton have put into the box in this game, and it gets turned into the back of the net by Pedro's equally good header.
Broja goes over the top of Baker-Boaitey trying to win an aerial challenge, and he's come out of it with his nose bleeding. He needs patching up but initially refuses to go off until the referee forces the issue.
There are so many bodies in Chelsea's six-yard box as Milner swings another corner into the box. This one misses everyone in the middle, and though Adingra keeps it in play on the far side, it's caught by Sanchez.
SAVE! Still, Brighton push for an equaliser, and they look to their right again as Gross gets a yard on Badiashile. The German pulls it back to Ferguson, who improvises with a clever backheel flick, but there's no power on it and Sanchez holds on.
SAVE! There's still a couple of minutes to go in this tie, but Chelsea are standing firm for now. Pedro drops back to the edge of the box to get the ball before drilling a low shot on goal, but Sanchez gets down to hold this one too.
PENALTY TO BRIGHTON! In the dying seconds, Brighton have a major lifeline! Or do they? Adingra whips a cross in from the right, and Colwill's arm is level with his head. The penalty is given for a handball, but it looks like it actually hits him in the face. This might get overturned....
NO PENALTY! After watching the replays of the penalty and seeing that it clearly smacks Colwill in the side of the head, the referee decides to overturn his original decision, and it's actually a drop ball to Chelsea, much to Brighton's disbelief.
Brighton are adamant that they either should've had a free-kick for a foul on Gross earlier in the move, or a corner for his blocked cross. Neither is given, and Pedro is booked for dissent.
FULL-TIME: CHELSEA 3-2 BRIGHTON.
Ten-man Chelsea hold on to get a vital home win as they beat Brighton 3-2. The Blues made a perfect start to the game, with two corners causing Brighton all sorts of problems. Fernandez headed in his first Premier League goal from the first, while Colwill thumped in his first Chelsea goal to double their tally. That lead was halved just before the break, with Buonanotte curling in a wonderful strike before Gallagher received his second yellow card. Fernandez got his second of the game in the 65th minute from the spot after Milner fouled Mudryk, and it took Brighton until stoppage time to pull back another, with Pedro flicking it in at the near post. In the dying moments, the referee awarded a spot-kick to the Seagulls for handball, but it was overturned by VAR. It's a win that lifts Chelsea into 10th, and they'll be hoping to build some momentum off this as they travel to Manchester United on Wednesday. Brighton stay in eighth, with Brentford at home next up for them. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Sheffield United picked up only their second win of the season as they beat Brentford 1-0 thanks to a fantastic goal from James McAtee.
The Manchester City loanee’s first Premier League goal was enough to secure all three points at Bramall Lane as manager Chris Wilder got his first win on his return to the club.
Yoane Wissa and Keane Lewis-Potter came into the Brentford side looking to step up in the absence of the injured Bryan Mbeumo, but the Bees were boosted by Christian Norgaard’s return from suspension.
Wilder made seven changes to the team who lost to Liverpool in midweek. 
After a quiet start, Brentford players appealed for a penalty in the 27th minute when Anel Ahmedhodzic brought down Ethan Pinnock, but referee Stuart Atwell was not interested.
Three minutes later, Brentford’s Frank Onyeka survived a VAR check for a red card after a foul on Vinicius Souza which left the midfielder needing treatment for five minutes.
Sheff Utd took the lead on the stroke of half-time as McAtee produced a stunning strike to beat Mark Flekken, curling the ball into the far corner from the right side of the box.
Substitute Anis Slimane missed a huge chance in the 56th minute to double Sheff Utd’s lead as he shot straight at Flekken from point-blank range after Cameron Archer had won the ball high up the pitch and teed up his team-mate.
Flekken was forced into another save with 10 minutes to go when Archer went through on goal. He overpowered Ben Mee to get to a loose ball but could not beat the goalkeeper with his shot.
Slimane burst into the box just a minute later as the Blades pushed hard for a second, but the Tunisian could only find the side-netting from a very tight angle.
The Bees threw everything at an equaliser but fell short in the end despite efforts from Wissa and Mee.
Sheff Utd are still bottom, now with eight points. Brentford remain 11th but are level on 19 points with three other teams.

Team_4	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League meeting between Team_7 and Team_5 at Stamford Bridge!\nWith an upturn in form, things had started to look up for Team_7 in recent weeks. Going into last weekend, they'd lost just one of eight games in competitions (W5 D2), with that run including a 1-0 win over Team_5 in the EFL Cup in late September. They followed it up last weekend with a heavy 4-1 defeat at Team_15. Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping his team can bounce back today and turn around their home form as they've won just one of their last 14 Premier League games at Stamford Bridge which came against promoted Team_12 (3-0).\nTeam_5 come into today on the back of a midweek high having secured their place in the knockout rounds of the Europa League with a 1-0 win over AEK Athens on Thursday. They also ended a run of six without a win in the Premier League last weekend after holding on for a 3-2 over Team_16. They've enjoyed success in the league against Team_7 in recent years, going unbeaten against them in their last five such meetings (W2 D3), including doing the double over them last season.\nTeam_7 STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Robert Sanchez; Axel Disasi, Beniot Badiashile, Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill; Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo; Raheem Sterling, Conor Gallagher, Mykhailo Mudryk; Nicolas Jackson.\nTeam_7 SUBS: Lucas Bergstrom, Alfie Gilchrist, Alex Matos, Deivid Washington, Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, Armando Broja, Ian Maatsen, Dorde Petrovic.\nTeam_5 STARTING XI (4-2-3-1): Jason Steele; Joel Veltman, Jan-Paul van Hecke, Igor Julio, Jack Hinshelwood; Carlos Baleba, Billy Gilmour; Facundo Buonanotte, Adam Lallana, Simon Adingra; Evan Ferguson.\nTeam_5 SUBS: Mark O'Mahony, James Milner, Kaoru Mitoma, Benicio Baker-Boaitey, Bart Verbruggen, Joao Pedro, Jakub Moder, Leigh Kavanagh, Pascal Gross.\nPochettino makes four changes from the loss to Team_15 last Saturday, as Disasi, Colwill, Caicedo and Mudryk all come into the side. Reece James was sent off in that game, while Marc Cucurella picked up his fifth booking of the season, so they're both suspended. Palmer drops to the bench, while Lesley Ugochukwu isn't in the squad.\nRoberto De Zerbi makes five changes to his team after their win over AEK Athens on Thursday. Steele starts in goal, with Van Hecke, Baleba, Buonanotte and Lallana also being brought in. Verbruggen, Gross, Mitoma and Pedro start on the bench, while Lewis Dunk serves the first game of his suspension after being sent off against Forest last weekend.\nThe teams are out on the pitch now, with kick-off just moments away!\nJackson gets the game under way for Team_7!\nTeam_5 do well to win it back in midfield and quickly counter, though Adingra can't get into the box. Ferguson is nudged off the ball by Badiashile, but it rolls towards Adingra again, who is wiped out by Sanchez. After a quick VAR check, there's no penalty.\nTeam_5 have made a bright start to this game and they're putting Team_7 under some early pressure. Veltman links up well with Buonanotte down the right, but Silva reacts quickly to stop him from cutting inside.\nIt's better from Team_7 here as Sterling holds off Hinshelwood long enough to play a reverse pass down the left for Jackson. He isn't strong enough though, and Julio is able to clear the danger for Team_5.\nGallagher sweeps it out to Sterling, who plays a one-two with Jackson to lose his marker so he can square a low cross into the box. He's looking for Mudryk at the far post, but doesn't get enough on it, and Baleba intercepts.\nTeam_5 have failed to score in eight of their 10 away games against Team_7 in all competitions, including a 1-0 defeat already this season in the EFL Cup.\nTeam_7 do well to pass it out from the back around Team_5 high press, but Sterling is tripped by Hinshelwood to win a free-kick. The Blues take it short, but it comes to nothing as Mudryk loses the ball when it gets to him.\nTeam_5 are struggling to keep hold of the ball in the final third, with their attacks fizzling out and turning into Team_7 breaks. Sterling leads the latest charge and has options ahead of him, but can't pick any of them out.\nSterling makes another surging run down the right, and he has the beating of Hinshelwood once more. He loops a cross into the far post, but it's just behind Mudryk.\nFERNANDEZ SCORES! Team_5 are caught out from a corner, which is swung deep into Badiashile at the far post by Gallagher. He has Hinshelwood tight to him as well as his back to goal, but he improvises, volleying it over his shoulder. Fernandez is unmarked at the far post, and he nods in from close range. 1-0 Team_7!\nIt's good work by Badiashile, who could've looked to Mudryk, who was making a supporting run down the left. Instead, he picks out a good cross himself.\nBLOCK! Team_5 just can't get out of their own half at the moment, and Jackson's darting run down the left has the visitors scrambling back into their box. He clips it in from the byline, but Van Hecke blocks it just ahead of Fernandez.\nCHANCE! Team_7 have the feel for it now, and it's back with Sterling down the right side. He fizzes a low cross into the six-yard box, but Baleba slides in to deflect it just wide of the near post.\nCOLWILL SCORES! It's another corner that has Team_5 scrambling, and again, it's swung deep to the far post. Jackson peels away from Julio to nod it back into the mix and Colwill rises highest to thump a header on goal. It originally looks like Gilmour manages to clear it off the line, but the referee's watch buzzes, and the Team_5 midfielder didn't do it in time. 2-0 Team_7!\nJulio couldn't even get off the floor as the corner was hung into the far post, but Jackson was alert and backpedalled to head it back into the crowd in the six-yard box.\nDe Zerbi is pacing in his technical area, and he'll have concerns about how those two goals were conceded. Team_5 are pushing upfield at the moment, but they don't seem to know what to do when they get into the final third.\nAdingra wins a free-kick through the middle and Gilmour clips it into the box. Silva only half clears it, but Hinshelwood rushes in to try and keep it alive, only to lift it out of play under pressure from Caicedo.\nThere's a very nervy moment at the back for Team_7 as Sanchez is far too casual when Fernandez knocks it back to him. The ball skims off his foot and rolls towards his net, but the keeper reacts quickly to prevent the own goal.\nColwill makes a driving run through midfield and Van Hecke tries to block the path, getting a kick in the process. He stays down, but gets back to his feet after a little while without needing treatment.\nGallagher is late getting across to Buonanotte and crashes into the youngster with a clumsy challenge. He picks up the first booking of the game.\nGallagher gives away another free-kick in midfield, and Gilmour lifts it long into the box once more. It's another comfortable clearance for Team_7 though, who look very at ease in this game.\nTeam_7 look like they want it more in midfield, and their high press is causing Team_5 all sorts of problems.

Straight from the restart, Team_7 want to restore their two-goal cushion and Mudryk surges down the left before sending his cross into the box. It deflects off Julio's trailing leg, and Steele is at full stretch to tip it away.\nGALLAGHER IS OFF! After such a strong start to the game, things are going downhill for Team_7! Gilmour was racing away through the middle and Gallagher made up a lot of ground to get to him. The ball is already out of his reach, and he clumsily brings down the Scotsman. It earns him his second yellow card, and for the second game in a row, Team_7 are down to 10 men!\nUnsurprisingly, that red card has just tipped the momentum in Team_5 favour and they're putting Team_7 under pressure already.

It was a perfect start for the Blues, who dominated for most of the first half. It was two corners that caught out Team_5, with Fernandez heading in his first-ever Premier League goal from close range, before Colwill netted his first Team_7 goal with a thumping header.

He flicks his header on, and Sanchez has no chance as it skims into the far side of his net. 3-2, but can Team_5 get another one with eight minutes still to go?\nIt's the best delivery that Team_5 have put into the box in this game, and it gets turned into the back of the net by Pedro's equally good header.\nBroja goes over the top of Baker-Boaitey trying to win an aerial challenge, and he's come out of it with his nose bleeding. He needs patching up but initially refuses to go off until the referee forces the issue.\nThere are so many bodies in Team_7 six-yard box as Milner swings another corner into the box. This one misses everyone in the middle, and though Adingra keeps it in play on the far side, it's caught by Sanchez.\nSAVE! Still, Team_5 push for an equaliser, and they look to their right again as Gross gets a yard on Badiashile. The German pulls it back to Ferguson, who improvises with a clever backheel flick, but there's no power on it and Sanchez holds on.\nSAVE! There's still a couple of minutes to go in this tie, but Team_7 are standing firm for now. Pedro drops back to the edge of the box to get the ball before drilling a low shot on goal, but Sanchez gets down to hold this one too.\nPENALTY TO Team_5! In the dying seconds, Team_5 have a major lifeline! Or do they? Adingra whips a cross in from the right, and Colwill's arm is level with his head. The penalty is given for a handball, but it looks like it actually hits him in the face. This might get overturned....\nNO PENALTY! After watching the replays of the penalty and seeing that it clearly smacks Colwill in the side of the head, the referee decides to overturn his original decision, and it's actually a drop ball to Team_7, much to Team_5 disbelief.\nTeam_5 are adamant that they either should've had a free-kick for a foul on Gross earlier in the move, or a corner for his blocked cross. Neither is given, and Pedro is booked for dissent.\nFULL-TIME: Team_7 3-2 Team_5.\nTen-man Team_7 hold on to get a vital home win as they beat Team_5 3-2. The Blues made a perfect start to the game, with two corners causing Team_5 all sorts of problems. Fernandez headed in his first Premier League goal from the first, while Colwill thumped in his first Team_7 goal to double their tally. That lead was halved just before the break, with Buonanotte curling in a wonderful strike before Gallagher received his second yellow card. Fernandez got his second of the game in the 65th minute from the spot after Milner fouled Mudryk, and it took Team_5 until stoppage time to pull back another, with Pedro flicking it in at the near post. In the dying moments, the referee awarded a spot-kick to the Seagulls for handball, but it was overturned by VAR. It's a win that lifts Team_7 into 10th, and they'll be hoping to build some momentum off this as they travel to Team_14 on Wednesday. Team_5 stay in eighth, with Team_4 at home next up for them. That's all for today, goodbye!""]"	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93394	Crystal Palace	Nott'm Forest	2023-10-07	Selhurst Park, London	25017.0	Craig Pawson	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Crystal Palace and Fulham at Selhurst Park.
Palace lost just one of their opening four Premier League fixtures before falling to defeat against Aston Villa in their previous outing. The Eagles have seven points on the board after securing wins over early struggles Sheffield United and Wolves and a draw versus Brentford, with their only beating coming at the hands of Arsenal. The hosts came close to extending their unbeaten run to four matches at Villa Park and were leading until 87th-minute when Jhon Duran scored the equaliser. Douglas Luiz and Leon Bailey then netted in stoppage time to complete the comeback for Unai Emery’s men. Palace will want to return to winning ways, but they have failed to beat Fulham in their last three encounters (drawing two and losing one).
Fulham have an identical record to their London rivals and are only behind Roy Hodgson’s side on goal difference. The Cottagers also started their campaign with a win after beating Everton before going on a three-game winless run. An enthralling 2-2 draw with Arsenal came between two heavy defeats, with Marco Silva overseeing a 3-0 loss to Brentford and a 5-1 defeat to Manchester City. However, confidence will be back after a victory in their last match. Carlos Vinicius netted his fourth goal in six games in a 1-0 triumph over Luton Town, netting the winner just three minutes after coming off the bench.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Cheick Doucoure, Will Hughes; Jordan Ayew, Eberechi Eze, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: Dean Henderson, Remi Matthews, Rob Holding, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Nathaniel Clyne, Malcolm Ebiowei, Chris Richards, Jairo Riedewald, Jesurun Rak-Sakyi.
FULHAM (4-3-3): Bernd Leno; Timothy Castagne, Issa Diop, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson; Harrison Reed, Joao Palhinha, Andreas Pereira; Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Raul Jimenez, Willian.
FULHAM SUBS: Marek Rodak, Calvin Bassey, Harry Wilson, Tom Cairney, Fode Ballo-Toure, Rodrigo Muniz, Alex Iwobi, Carlos Vinicius, Tyrese Francois.
Palace make one change to the side that lost to Villa in their previous match. Guehi is back after recovering from an injury and captains the side at centre-back, with Richards dropping onto the bench.
Fulham make two alterations to the team that beat Luton in their last fixture. Robinson returns to the squad and takes the place of Kenny Tete, who is injured. Cordova-Reid is also named in the attack and replaces Wilson.
Fulham won this exact fixture 3-0 last season, but haven't won consecutive away league games against Crystal Palace since a run of three between 1974 and 1978. Both teams are now on the pitch and they are ready to get started.
Fulham get this Premier League match under way. Pereira with the first pass.
Fulham have kept the ball for the opening couple of minutes and are passing it around at a slow pace. They are looking to break Palace's rigid structure, but the hosts are deciding not to press with intensity in the early stages.
SAVE! Fulham have the first chance of the match. Willian turns on the ball inside Palace's half and lays a pass down the left to Robinson. The left-back breaks into space before looking for Pereira in the box, who forces Johnstone into making a strong save.
Reed is on the floor off the pitch after a heavy collision with Hughes. He holds his back before returning to his feet, with Fulham winning a throw-in.
The ball is loose outside Palace's box and Pereira looks to win it. Hughes gets ahead of him but pokes it across to Willian who is free. However, he was fouled by Pereira and the referee gives a free-kick to the home side.
Hughes is surrounded by a couple of Fulham players inside the Palace half before being fouled by Reed. He wants to take the free-kick quickly and drives a low pass into the feet of Eze, but the referee stops the game because the ball is rolling.
Diop is casual in possession and is beaten by the physicality of Edouard, who pushes him off the ball before feeding Eze down the left. He runs away and is free down the left, but the referee blows for a foul.
SAVE! Fulham are patient in possession and play a short passing game before finding Willian on the left. The winger drives across the edge of the box and curls a right-footed effort towards the bottom corner, but Johnstone gets down to push it away.
Palhinha plays a short corner from the left, with Fulham deciding to play the ball around their midfield before going back to the former Manchester United man on the right. He then curls a low cross into the box that is cleared away by Guehi.
Palhinha is shown the first yellow card of the game for pulling back Schlupp, who was breaking away with the ball.
Ayew gets the ball into Fulham's box for the first time in this game, but his inswinging cross from the right is headed away by Diop.
Ream fails to clear away Ward's chipped pass into Schlupp, who escapes him before being dragged to the floor moments before getting into the box. The centre-back is then shown a yellow card.
Eze is over the free-kick and loops a cross onto the head of Ward, who has his powerful effort blocked. Andersen was behind the right-back and looks confused as to why he did not get the chance to attack the ball.
Ream pushes Schlupp in the back and gives away a free-kick in a crossing position. Eze curls it into the box with his right foot towards Ayew, but Willian and Cordova-Reid work together to get it away.
The third yellow card of the game goes to Ayew, who fouls Palhinha in the air. The Fulham man is still on the floor and is receiving treatment.
Fulham's medical staff are taking their time and are doing all the required checks to make sure that Palhinha can continue. He is back on his feet and is walking off the pitch but will come back on.
Andersen is down after being hit by the elbow of Jimenez in the air. He briefly stays down before returning to his feet.
Guehi dribbles with the ball inside his own half before curling a pass down the left flank to Eze. However, his pass is too far away from his team-mate and Fulham have it back.
Eze receives the ball on the edge of the box and attempts to drive a pass down the left after spotting the run of Hughes. However, Diop is aware of the danger and rushes across to regain possession.
Fulham have been the better side in this game and have had a couple of good chances to score. They have only won one of their last 20 away Premier League London derbies (drawing five and losing 14), a 3-0 win at Crystal Palace last season.
Eze takes his time with a free-kick after adjusting the placement of the ball. He eventually blasts a low strike straight at Leno, ignoring the crossing options in the middle.
Castagne moves into the box and gets past a couple of defenders on the byline before driving a low shot into the gloves of Johnstone.
CHANCE! Reed plays a short pass into the feet of Pereira, who switches the ball from left to right into the feet of Jiménez. The striker takes a touch and is one-on-one with Johnstone, but his powerful strike is pushed behind.
Robinson attempts to slide an incisive pass down the left channel to Pereira, but Andersen gets in the way. Pereira then fouls the centre-back before going down after a slight nudge off the ball. The home fans then show their displeasure.
Cordova-Reid wins possession inside Palace's half and attempts to drive forward with the ball. He originally escapes Mitchell before being fouled by the left-back, who is shown a yellow card.
Pereira fakes a cross before launching a deep free-kick into Palace's box. Diop leaps in the air to get on the end of it, but the ball hits the top of his head and goes out for a goal-kick.
WIDE! Palace's first chance of the game comes through Eze. The England international receives the ball on the edge of the box and runs past Reed before curling his strike just wide of the post.
Castagne flashes a low cross into Palace's box, but nobody is there to attack it and Johnstone comes out to dive on the ball.
Schlupp wins a late corner off of Palhinha, who stops him from moving into the box. Andersen dives across to get onto the end of Eze's cross, but he cannot direct the ball towards the goal.
There will be four minutes of additional time.
There is a short stop to the game after a heavy challenge from Hughes on Willian. The former Chelsea man goes down holding his foot before getting back to his feet.
Ayew bursts down the right with the ball and evades Ream before chipping a cross into the box. However, it has too much height on it and is too close to Leno, allowing the goalkeeper to make a simple catch.
HALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 0-0 FULHAM
Fulham had the better chances before the break, but the game is goalless at half-time. Johnstone has been called into action a couple of times and denied Pereira inside the first three minutes. The former Manchester United man received the ball inside the box on the left and blasted his shot across the goal, with Johnstone making a smart stop. Willian then looked to break the deadlock with a curling effort angled towards the bottom corner, but the England international got across to push it wide. Palace were quiet for most of the half. However, Eze was always posing a threat. He arrived on the edge of the box and looked to whip a shot into the corner. However, it flashed just wide of the post.
Palace had just one shot on target before the break and must do more to support Edouard. The striker has had just 11 touches and has been kept quiet by Ream and Diop. Eze has shown fleeting moments of quality but has also not seen enough of the ball. As for Fulham, they started the game quickly before slowing down. Willian has shown his ability on the left, with the Cottagers looking much more effective in the attack due to the return of left-back Robinson. However, Palhinha must be careful in the midfield as he has already been shown a yellow card.
Palace get the ball rolling again. No changes at the break.
Hughes has the ball on his right foot but uses his quick feet to get past Palhinha and switch it over to his left. His curling effort from outside the box is then caught by Leno.
Diop has the ball inside Fulham's half and launches a long pass up the pitch. However, nobody makes the run and Palace have it back.
Ayew and Robinson get into a battle on the right just outside Fulham's box, with the Palace man moving his body one way and pushing the ball the other to get past the defender. He then blasts a low cross into the gloves of Leno.
Eze skips past Castagne and pokes a throughball down the left side of the box to Edouard, who has his blasted attempt pushed over by Leno. The flag then goes up for offside against the striker, who did not watch the line and was past the defence by a distance.
Pereira and Willian are over a free-kick on the right. The latter takes and curls a cross into the box that is headed away by Edouard.
Andersen displays his range of passing and switches the play from right to left towards Mitchell. He looks to volley a cross into the box, but it goes up in the air, allowing Diop to beat Eze to the ball.
PENALTY SHOUT! Mitchell gets down the left flank again and drags a low cross into the middle of the box. Eze looks to get onto the end of it but goes down under a challenge from Reed. He wants a penalty, but the referee ignores his claims.
Robinson has possession on the left and floats a high cross into the box. Jimenez beats Guehi in the air but heads his attempt over the bar.
Mitchell is on the floor inside Palace's box and requires medical attention. He walks off the pitch and will be able to continue.
Palace have been better since the restart and are protecting Johnstone well. They have lost just two of their last 12 home Premier League matches (winning four and drawing six), defeats against Man City in March and Arsenal in August. Since Roy Hodgson returned in April, the Eagles have picked up 14 points in seven league games at Selhurst Park (winning four, drawing two and losing one).
Hughes plays a short pass across to Eze, who unleashes a curling effort from the edge of the box. The ball hits the elbow of Castagne, but his arms were by his side.
Robinson displays his pace and pushes the ball past Ward, running the other way around him to get onto the end of it on the other side. The USA international then whips a cross into the box towards Jimenez, but Guehi gets across to head it away.
CHANCE! Fulham should have broke the deadlock. Cordova-Reid drives down the middle of the pitch and has options to his left and right outside the box. He slots a pass into the feet of Jimenez, who decides against shooting from a tight angle. He looks for Pereira, who is free next to the goal, but it evades his outstretched foot.
Doucoure is shown a yellow card for a late tackle on Willian outside the box.
Pereira and Willian are over the free-kick. The former takes it, crashing the wall with his attempt.
Palace make the first change of the game. Schlupp has been fantastic in this game and put  Palhinha and Ream on yellow cards, but he is now coming off. Mateta takes his place.
Willian switches the ball from left to right and finds Castagne on the byline. He attempts to direct a cross into the middle but gets it all wrong.
Palace have had most of the ball for the last couple of minutes, but have not been able to do anything with it. They have moved into Fulham's defensive third on a couple of occasions. However, the away side have defended their box well.
Eze moves into the middle of the pitch and looks to unlock Edouard on the right. However, his touch is poor, allowing Robinson to come away with the ball.
Fulham make their first change of the game. Pereira is usually an influential figure but has been quiet since the restart. Iwobi made a big impact off the bench against Luton and is being tasked with doing the same today.
The tempo of the game has dropped in the last 10 minutes. There have been a lot of loose passes and both teams are giving away possession cheaply. The match is there for the taking if Palace of Fulham improve their ability to create chances in the final 13 minutes.
Eze's outswinging corner is met by Andersen, but he heads the ball well over the bar.
Fulham make a straight swap in the attack. Jimenez is replaced by Vinicius, who scored the winning goal in the game against Luton.
Wilson also makes his way onto the pitch. Cordova-Reid is the player to come off.
Wilson is straight into the action and looks to make space for a shot on the edge of the box. However, Ayew tracks him all the way and makes the block.
Guehi has been vital for Palace at the heart of the defence. He gets ahead of Vinicius to head away another cross from Robinson.
SAVE! What a stop from Johnstone. Castagne keeps the ball on the pitch on the right and plays a short pass into the box to Reed, who drives a cross into the feet of Willian. He is free on the left and blasts a low shot across the goal that is blocked by Johnstone.
Mitchell breaks free on the left and floats a cross to the back on the box. Ayew makes a darting run to get onto the end of it and looks to have a free header, but Robinson makes a vital intervention.
CHANCE! Eze spots the run of Mateta, who breaks free of Fuham's defence and rushes into the box. He collects the ball well and looks to drive a shot across the goal and into the bottom corner, but his attempt is tame. Leno gets down and makes a simple stop.
Eze's inswinging corner from the left is cleared away. Fulham almost get a chance to break away on the counter after a poor pass from Doucoure, but Hughes slides across to stop them from getting forward.
Eze delicately chips the ball over Fulham's defence and into the path of Mateta, who is forced down the left. He then flashes a cross into Edouard, but the flag goes up for offside.
Edouard started the game up front but failed to have a shot in the match. Rak-Sakyi is on for the final three minutes.
Fulham have a late chance to score a winner. Robinson breaks forward with the ball and has options ahead of him, but waits for too long to thread a throughball into Vinicius, with the striker running offside.
FULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 0-0 FULHAM
Fulham had the better chances against Palace but couldn't find a way through Johnstone, with the game ending goalless. The Eagles shot-stopper goalkeeper denied Pereira inside the first three minutes before getting across his line to push Willian's whipped effort around the post later in the half. Jimenez also had a one-on-one opportunity, but the goalkeeper made himself big to block his attempt. They then went close to opening the scoring but squandered an opportunity. Cordova-Reid found Jimenez in the box, but he looked for a pass rather than a shot, with the ball rolling out for a goal-kick. Johnstone saved another shot from Willian, with Mateta having Palace's best chance. He escaped the defence but struck his effort into the gloves of Leno.
The Eagles now have back-to-back trips to Old Trafford and will face Manchester United in the third round of the EFL Cup before playing them again in the Premier League. As for Fulham, they will host Norwich City in the EFL Cup. Marco Silva’s men will then welcome Chelsea to Craven Cottage in the league.
That's all for today, goodbye."	"Roy Hodgson became only the eighth manager to take charge of 400 Premier League matches as he saw his depleted Crystal Palace side share a goalless draw with Nottingham Forest. 
Palace went into the match at Selhurst Park missing a number of key attacking players through injury and suffered another setback as Jeffery Schlupp limped off midway through the first half. 
With Forest’s leading scorer Taiwo Awoniyi also out for a month and Palace’s injury woes, scoring opportunities were always going to be at a premium. 
Forest had the better of the first-half chances, most notably when Morgan Gibbs-White went through on 21 minutes but saw his volleyed lob over Sam Johnstone hit the far post and rebound into the goalkeeper’s arms. 
Palace had a glorious opportunity to go ahead in the 63rd minute when Odsonne Edouard set up Jean-Philippe Mateta on the edge of the area but the French forward shot narrowly wide.  
The away side looked more like getting a late winner but Johnstone stood strong to deny Forest twice as Palace stay ninth with 12 points, while Forest are 13th with nine points.

The latter takes and curls a cross into the box that is headed away by Edouard.\nAndersen displays his range of passing and switches the play from right to left towards\xa0Mitchell. He looks to volley a cross into the box, but it goes up in the air, allowing Diop to beat Eze to the ball.\nPENALTY SHOUT!\xa0Mitchell gets down the left flank again and drags a low cross into the middle of the box. Eze looks to get onto the end of it but goes down under a challenge from\xa0Reed. He wants a penalty, but the referee ignores his claims.\nRobinson has possession on the left and floats a high cross into the box.\xa0Jimenez beats\xa0Guehi in the air but heads his attempt over the bar.\nMitchell is on the floor inside Palace's box and requires medical attention. He walks off the pitch and will be able to continue.\nPalace have been better since the restart and are protecting\xa0Johnstone well.\xa0They have lost just two of their last 12 home Premier League matches (winning four and drawing six), defeats against Team_13 in March and Team_1 in August. Since Roy Hodgson returned in April, the Eagles have picked up 14 points in seven league games at Selhurst Park (winning four, drawing two and losing one).\nHughes plays a short pass across to Eze, who unleashes a curling effort from the edge of the box. The ball hits the elbow of\xa0Castagne, but his arms were by his side.\nRobinson displays his pace and pushes the ball past Ward, running the other way around him to get onto the end of it on the other side. The USA international then whips a cross into the box towards\xa0Jimenez, but\xa0Guehi gets across to head it away.\nCHANCE! Team_10 should have broke the deadlock.\xa0Cordova-Reid drives down the middle of the pitch and has options to his left and right outside the box. He slots a pass into the feet of\xa0Jimenez, who decides against shooting from a tight angle. He looks for\xa0Pereira, who is free next to the goal, but it evades his outstretched foot.\nDoucoure is shown a yellow card for a late tackle on Willian outside the box.\nPereira and Willian are over the free-kick. The former takes it, crashing the wall with his attempt.\nPalace make the first change of the game.\xa0Schlupp has been fantastic in this game and put\xa0\xa0Palhinha and\xa0Ream on yellow cards, but he is now coming off.\xa0Mateta takes his place.\nWillian switches the ball from left to right and finds\xa0Castagne on the byline. He attempts to direct a cross into the middle but gets it all wrong.\nPalace have had most of the ball for the last couple of minutes, but have not been able to do anything with it. They have moved into Team_10 defensive third on a couple of occasions. However, the away side have defended their box well.\nEze moves into the middle of the pitch and looks to unlock Edouard on the right. However, his touch is poor, allowing\xa0Robinson to come away with the ball.\nTeam_10 make their first change of the game.\xa0Pereira is usually an influential figure but has been quiet since the restart.\xa0Iwobi made a big impact off the bench against Luton and is being tasked with doing the same today.\nThe tempo of the game has dropped in the last 10 minutes. There have been a lot of loose passes and both teams are giving away possession cheaply. The match is there for the taking if Palace of Team_10 improve their ability to create chances in the final 13 minutes.\nEze's outswinging corner is met by\xa0Andersen, but he heads the ball well over the bar.\nTeam_10 make a straight swap in the attack.\xa0Jimenez is replaced by\xa0Vinicius, who scored the winning goal in the game against Luton.\nWilson also makes his way onto the pitch.\xa0Cordova-Reid is the player to come off.\nWilson is straight into the action and looks to make space for a shot on the edge of the box. However, Ayew tracks him all the way and makes the block.\nGuehi has been vital for Palace at the heart of the defence. He gets ahead of\xa0Vinicius to head away another cross from\xa0Robinson.\nSAVE! What a stop from\xa0Johnstone.\xa0Castagne keeps the ball on the pitch on the right and plays a short pass into the box to Reed, who drives a cross into the feet of Willian. He is free on the left and blasts a low shot across the goal that is blocked by\xa0Johnstone.\nMitchell breaks free on the left and floats a cross to the back on the box. Ayew makes a darting run to get onto the end of it and looks to have a free header, but\xa0Robinson makes a vital intervention.\nCHANCE! Eze spots the run of\xa0Mateta, who breaks free of Fuham's defence and rushes into the box. He collects the ball well and looks to drive a shot across the goal and into the bottom corner, but his attempt is tame. Leno gets down and makes a simple stop.\nEze's inswinging corner from the left is cleared away. Team_10 almost get a chance to break away on the counter after a poor pass from Doucoure, but Hughes slides across to stop them from getting forward.\nEze delicately chips the ball over Team_10 defence and into the path of\xa0Mateta, who is forced down the left. He then flashes a cross into Edouard, but the flag goes up for offside.\nEdouard started the game up front but failed to have a shot in the match.\xa0Rak-Sakyi is on for the final three minutes.\nTeam_10 have a late chance to score a winner. Robinson breaks forward with the ball and has options ahead of him, but waits for too long to thread a throughball into Vinicius, with the striker running offside.\nFULL-TIME: Team_8 0-0 Team_10\nTeam_10 had the better chances against Palace but couldn't find a way through Johnstone, with the game ending goalless. The Eagles shot-stopper goalkeeper denied Pereira inside the first three minutes before getting across his line to push Willian's whipped effort around the post later in the half. Jimenez also had a one-on-one opportunity, but the goalkeeper made himself big to block his attempt. They then went close to opening the scoring but squandered an opportunity. Cordova-Reid found Jimenez in the box, but he looked for a pass rather than a shot, with the ball rolling out for a goal-kick. Johnstone saved another shot from Willian, with Mateta having Palace's best chance. He escaped the defence but struck his effort into the gloves of Leno.\nThe Eagles now have back-to-back trips to Old Trafford and will face Team_14 in the third round of the EFL Cup before playing them again in the Premier League. As for Team_10, they will host Norwich City in the EFL Cup. Marco Silva’s men will then welcome Team_7 to Craven Cottage in the league.\nThat's all for today, goodbye.""]"	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	Normal
93632	Brighton	Arsenal	2024-04-06	American Express Stadium, Falmer	31677.0	John Brooks	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of Newcastle United v Everton.
Newcastle are on a four-match unbeaten run and looking to build on their late season momentum, having come from 3-1 down to beat West Ham 4-3 at the weekend. The hosts are in eighth place on 43 points, trailing fifth-placed Aston Villa by 13 points for a Europa League spot. They’ve only lost three times at home this season, while their record against Everton will give them further confidence: the Magpies have won five of their last seven meetings. A win today would see them leapfrog West Ham into sixth place.
Everton are desperate to bring a halt to a grim run of results, and will likely take inspiration from the fact that their only win in eight midweek Premier League matches was a 3-0 victory over Newcastle in the reverse fixture. The Toffees sit 16th in the Premier League, just three points above the drop zone, and are winless in their last 12 Premier League games – their longest league run without a victory since 1957 – including their last seven on the road. A win today would see them complete the league double over the Magpies for the first time since 2017-18, and take them above Brentford into 15th.
NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Emil Krafth, Fabian Schar, Dan Burn, Lewis Hall; Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes; Elliot Anderson, Jacob Murphy, Alexander Isak, Harvey Barnes.
NEWCASTLE UNITED SUBS: Paul Dummett, Matt Ritchie, Lorius Karius, Joe Willock, Mark Gillespie, Joe White, Amadou Diallo, Alex Murphy, Ben Parkinson.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Ben Godfrey, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Ashley Young, Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana, Dwight McNeil; Abdoulaye Doucoure; Beto.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jack Harrison, Joao Virginia, Andre Gomes, Seamus Coleman, Youssef Chermiti, James Garner.
Substitute Harvey Barnes’ brace at the weekend is rewarded with a start for Newcastle tonight, while Emil Krafth, Lewis Hall and Elliot Anderson also come into the starting XI. Anthony Gordon won’t be able to face his former club as he serves a one-match ban. In another blow to the Magpies’ injury-stricken season, captain Jamaal Lascelles tore his ACL in that same match and will be out for up to nine months, while Miguel Almiron and Tino Livramento, also injured on Saturday, miss out on the squad too.
Everton boss Sean Dyche makes four changes from their midweek loss to Bournemouth, as Beto, Ashley Young, Vitalii Mykolenko – who has recovered from an illness - and Idrissa Gueye come in for Seamus Coleman, James Garner, Jack Harrison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Forwards Arnaut Danjuma and Lewis Dobbin are again set to miss out due to injuries.
The teams are out on the pitch and we’re about to get underway!
KICK-OFF: NEWCASTLE UNITED V EVERTON. Everton get us going - to an immediate chorus of boos from St James' Park.
Everton already under pressure! Newcastle with an early press up the pitch, but Barnes - replacing the suspended Gordon - can't quite get a touch on it. Isak then tries to tee up Barnes again but Pickford gets the block.
Branthwaite makes an interception at the back and Everton break. Young chips the ball over the Magpies defence but there's no one in the box to take advantage. Newcastle are enjoying most of the possession at the moment.
Barnes and Anderson link up well in the box but Everton - tripping up Barnes in the process - get it under control and break. A long ball from Pickford falls to Doucoure but his first strike from the edge of the box soars over the bar!
Every touch by an Everton player is greeted with deafening boos from the fortress that is St James' Park. Krafth just clips Beto before he can get the ball. Free-kick to Everton about 20 yards out...
Huge missed chance for Everton! McNeil's free-kick falls to Tarkowski, who nods it over the top from five yards out! That was a great chance squandered by the visitors...
Everton on the break! McNeil makes an excellent run through acres of space, Godfrey delivers it to Young in the box, but Newcastle defend it well. No corner for the visitors.
Krafth crosses to Isak in the box but Branthwaite is there to make the clearance. It goes out for a Newcastle corner - Hall swings it in to Guimaraes, who takes a touch, but it's too far over and Everton clear it safely.
This has been fairly even so far, with both sides fancying their chances on the break but yet to find a way through. Murphy sends a brilliant cross in Barnes' direction a few yards off the far post, but Godfrey wins their aerial duel and it's out for a Newcastle corner.
Pickford's long ball was expertly taken apart by Newcastle and Barnes already has an assist to his name, his through-ball soaring past the Everton defence and finding Isak.
GOOOAAAALLLL! Newcastle are 1-0 ahead and it's Alexander Isak once again, his 19th this season! The through-ball soars over Tarkowski and Isak weaves his way expertly past Branthwaite to slot it in the bottom corner, way out of Pickford's reach. The Toon goes wild!
Newcastle pressing again, Hall ducking and diving through the defence but Onana clears it. Beto goes sprawling on the turf after a challenge by Burn.
All Newcastle now! Onana slides in on Anderson driving down the left, and the Newcastle man goes down and wins a free-kick.
There's a brief pause in play for the players to break their Ramadan fast.
Everton have been a lot more subdued since going behind. The hosts are controlling the game, with 66% of the possession, and looking much more dangerous.
Anderson and Guimaraes get in each other's way a little in midfield. Anderson tries to get into space and wins a free kick after getting shoved over, near the Newcastle box.
Anderson drives down the centre and squares it to Barnes, but there's a sea of blue shirts in the box to block and after a bit of pinball Everton head it clear.
Massive chance for Murphy! Everton are camped out in their box and Murphy takes his chance to sprint through and have a shot from range - but it fizzes over the bar! Newcastle have had six attempts now to Everton's two and are bringing all the intensity.
Now Beto has a go for the visitors! He gets into a good position but his shot from the edge of the box is miles off target. Sean Dyche does not look impressed.
Guimaraes and Gueye get in an elaborate tangle and the Brazilian hauls him over, giving away a free kick in the centre. Nothing comes of it and Barnes attempts to break, but Everton regain possession - Beto tries to cut it back, possibly for Doucoure, but his accuracy is way off again and Newcastle recover it easily.
Isak's attempt to pass to Barnes down the left, frustrated by the Everton midfield, is greeted with appreciation by the crowd. Their star man has now scored in each of his last five Premier League home games, the first player to do so since Yoan Gouffran in 2013.
Everton once again are asleep at the back as Isak and Anderson again combine dangerously in the box, but Godfrey makes a great clearance to save their blushes. The resulting corner is flicked over by Burn for an Everton goal-kick.
Barnes makes another electric run down the left but Tarkowski arrests it and concedes a throw-in. In another worrying sight for Eddie Howe, Hall is down on the pitch, holding onto his ribs. Medical staff are on the pitch - is this yet another injury setback for the Magpies?
Play resumes. Guimaraes and Anderson wrestle with Everton over a corner and the latter goes down courtesy of Doucoure. Everton have possession now, but McNeil's ball goes nowhere.
Beto gets a talking to for a lunge on Krafth. Still no yellow cards in this game despite some feisty challenges. Hall is back up and appears to be moving well.
Chance for Everton! Doucoure finds some space in the box and has a good attempt, but Dubravka jumps and gets his gloves to it. That's the most positive Everton have looked all game!
Huge stop by Pickford! After a calmer period of Newcastle possession the ball falls to Barnes at the far left - he gets it around Pickford, who's off his line, but no one can get a decent touch on it. Murphy then has a go himself and the Everton goalkeeper sticks out a leg to keep it out!
Four added minutes here at St James' Park.
Huge chance for Newcastle and Isak almost has a second! He glides through the defence and has a glorious chance to put the hosts 2-0 up, but it floats just over the bar.
Murphy swings in a cross and Pickford does well to collect just a couple of yards out from goal!
HALF-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 1-0 EVERTON.
Newcastle are 1-0 up at the break! Both sides have had chances, but the hosts - roared on by the crowd - have looked much the brighter, led by star player Isak, who showed his worth with a brilliant strike in the opening 15 minutes. The Magpies have controlled the game well, with 62 per cent of possession compared to Everton's 38, and an xG of 1.37 to the Toffees' 0.47.
Everton need to turn this around quickly, and while they've threatened on the break, Newcastle haven't looked too troubled by their efforts so far. Worryingly for the visitors, they haven't won any of their last 25 Premier League games when trailing at half-time. They also failed to have a shot on target in that entire half - let's see if Dyche's half-time pep talk has any effect...
KICK-OFF: NEWCASTLE UNITED 1-0 EVERTON. Second half underway!
No changes at the break. Everton nick possession early on and Young hoofs a cross in towards Beto, but it doesn't quite find the target. A minute later Beto goes down in the box thanks to a shirt-pull by Schar but the ref is stone-faced to his appeals.
Almost a very embarrassing moment for Everton! Newcastle have a corner and the box is rammed. Tarkowski tries to clear but kicks it backwards onto his own post! It bounces away but wow, that could have been a disastrous start to this half!
Branthwaite chucks a long ball in the vague direction of Doucoure, approaching a near-empty Newcastle box, but Everton don't have the pace at the moment to make anything of it.
Guimaraes opts to leave a ball in his own penalty area and Beto launches towards it, sliding it on an approaching Dubravka. The keeper gets to it without much hassle but seems to clip his gloves on the Everton man in the process. Further up the pitch, Burn shoves McNeil over and concedes a free-kick.
Pickford takes the free-kick and sends it flying down towards the Newcastle box but the danger is cleared easily. Everton have a corner...
McNeil chips in the corner but it's rather flat and is cleared away. Everton have come out more strongly in this half, offering more in the opposition box. Tarkowski fires in a long ball but Onana, surrounded by Newcastle defenders, can't get his head to it and it sails behind.
Newcastle take a free kick, Isak squares the pass cutely to Dan Burn and the 6'7"" centre-back fires it home! But wait... It's gone to VAR... They're checking for an offside on Isak.
Decision made: Burn's goal is chalked off. Isak was leaning just a fraction too far forward beyond the Everton defence.
Dyche decides now is the time to make some changes. Doucoure is replaced by Gomes.
Onana comes off for James Garner.
And a final change for Everton: the misfiring Beto is replaced by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The latter hasn't scored in 23 games: can he break that streak here and get his side back in it?
Everton enjoy a spell of possession but Newcastle break! Pickford comes out to see to a long ball.
Calvert-Lewin jumps for a cross but Dubravka gets there first and catches!
Almost an equaliser for Everton! Garner - who has come on full of energy - spins on the ball and fires a brilliant first-time shot, but it bounces off the inside of the post! Huge, huge chance for Everton.
Chance after chance for Newcastle! It's absolute madness in the Everton box, Pickford is nowhere to be seen but Everton defend with their lives and Mykolenko clears Isak's shot just off the line - how is this still 1-0?! Barnes now fires another shot clear over the bar from a Krafth cross!
End-to-end stuff at the moment, Everton really energised by their substitutions. Mykolenko attempts to pass to McNeil in the box but Krafth knocks it out for an corner. It's floated to the back post, out to a central position where Young is waiting - but his fierce attempt is blocked by a defender.
Eddie Howe decides now is the time to make a change. Anderson is replaced by Joe Willock.
Schar slides in on Mykolenko to stop him advancing on goal. Everton are really ramping up the pressure now, Newcastle know their lead is slim and they can't sit this one out.
Longstaff does well to rob Garner of the ball and set up Willock on the break. Isak dances through the defence and passes to Barnes, but his effort is well saved by Pickford.
Godfrey knocks the ball behind and Newcastle have a corner. It's getting a bit feisty - Burn and Branthwaite are pushing and shoving each other in the box. Murphy's ball in is booted clear by Gomes.
Calvert-Lewin sprints forward in acres of space but with no-one to pass to in the box, he takes too much time and Burn gets to him and takes out the danger. Dummett looks to be readying himself - Hall is down on the turf again so may be about to be replaced.
Hall is indeed coming off, replaced by Paul Dummett, making a rare appearance.
Into the last 11 minutes. In the reverse fixture Everton scored three goals in that time - is this game going to have an equally dramatic end?
The first yellow of the game goes to Tarkowski for stepping on the back of Murphy's heel.
Another change for Everton: Portuguese youngster Youssef Chermiti replaces Gueye.
Chermiti's first action of the game is to trip up Krafth. Murphy is limping around, testing his heel - that looked like it hurt. Burn makes an excellent challenge to halt Chermiti's run on goal in its tracks.
Guimaraes boots a shot way over the bar. Late drama: VAR are checking for a possible penalty for Everton down the other end... Dummett hauled down Young by the neck in the box with the ball nowhere in sight. Could the visitors get a lifeline here?
Tony Harrington is being called to the screen...
PENALTY GIVEN! Everton DO get a lifeline! The ball is going nowhere near Young and Dummett, with his arm round his neck, hauls him down regardless. Calvert-Lewin to take - can he end his goal drought here and revitalise his season?
GOOOOAAAALLLL! Calvert-Lewin scores a penalty to make it 1-1! His powerful spot-kick clatters off Dubvraka's hand and into the back of the net - it's a huge, huge moment for Everton, is the comeback? Huge for Calvert-Lewin as well, his first goal in 23 games.
Another change from Everton, looking to capitalise on that equaliser. Godfrey is replaced by Seamus Coleman.
There will be NINE MINUTES of added time. Newcastle pushing...
Schar takes down Calvert-Lewin near the sideline, who goes flying straight into the Toffees manager. Seconds later Everton have a corner.
Tarkowski and Calvert-Lewin were both well-positioned to receive that but the whistle blew for some argy-bargy in the box.
Longstaff and Isak both in the Everton box trying to get a decent touch but Garner is there to marshal the defence. Both sides are pushing for a winner here with the St James' crowd roaring their players on. It deflects out for a Newcastle corner...
Murphy takes but the whistle blows - possibly before the corner was taken - as Burn shoves over Branthwaite. It's getting scrappy in the box and Tarkowski is remonstrating with the ref, annoyed at having to set up again.
Murphy takes it again, Burn and Branthwaite are - again - grappling in the box, but it's cleared out. Someone looked to have gone down in the box but the ref isn't interested.
Chermiti receives a yellow for a challenge on Schar.
Guimaraes takes the free kick and floats it towards Burn; Chermiti wins it back, Guimaraes is there once again and McNeil sees yellow for taking him down.
Guimaraes takes the free-kick, Branthwaite knocks it clear, and after a bit of pinball it comes into the hands of Pickford.
And that's the last action of the game!
FULL-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 1-1 EVERTON.
What a breathless end to that half! It ends 1-1, but Newcastle will be ruing that as a missed opportunity when they should have put the game to bed in a dominant first half. A glorious solo strike by Isak put the hosts in front after just 15 minutes, and he should have had a second shortly before the half-time whistle. But Everton, who had been flat since going behind, regrouped at the break and some inspired substitutions made the second half altogether more competitive. This was a game largely decided by two substitutes: Dummett, making a rare appearance for Newcastle, hacked down Young in the box and conceded a penalty, and Everton sub Calvert-Lewin - who has scored more goals against Newcastle, six, than any other side - levelled from the spot with his first goal since October. Newcastle had 60 per cent possession and an xG of 1.42 compared to the Toffees' 0.44, but couldn't capitalise, and Everton come away with a crucial point in their battle to avoid the drop. Thanks for reading!"	"How the match unfolded
Arsenal went back to the top of the Premier League table with a 3-0 victory over Brighton at the Amex Stadium.
Bukayo Saka’s penalty and Kai Havertz’s close-range finish put the Gunners, who had seen Manchester City join Liverpool at the top of the standings with a 4-2 victory over Crystal Palace earlier on Saturday, in control on the south coast.
An emphatic victory was secured when, on his first return to the Amex, former Brighton favourite Leandro Trossard dinked home late on.
While Arsenal will hope Manchester United do them a favour by beating Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday, Brighton are now in 10th, with their hopes of European qualification hanging by a thread.
Arsenal made a quick start and should have gone ahead inside 63 seconds, only for Gabriel Magalhaes to head wide of a gaping goal after being found by Martin Odegaard's free-kick.
Saka shot wide of the far corner and Gabriel Jesus was denied by a firm stop from Bart Verbruggen as Arsenal continued to probe, and the Gunners made the breakthrough shortly after the half-hour mark.
Lamptey clumsily felled Jesus as the Brazilian bustled into the penalty area, and John Brooks did not hesitate in pointing to the spot. Saka made no mistake from 12 yards, firing into the bottom-left corner for his 14th league goal of the season.
Julio Enciso went close to levelling in spectacular fashion shortly before half-time, but David Raya was able to claw his dipping strike away from the top-left corner.
Arsenal made Raya’s good work count in the 62nd minute – Jorginho getting to the byline and squaring for Havertz, who duly tucked in.
Having replaced Saka, Trossard tried his luck from distance soon after, but Bart Verbruggen was equal to the Belgium international’s low strike.
Brighton’s goalkeeper could do little to prevent Trossard from making it 3-0 in the 86th minute, though, with the winger keeping his cool in a one-v-one and lifting home a delicate finish to further compound his old club’s misery.
Verbruggen stopped Declan Rice and then Gabriel from making it a rout, as Mikel Arteta’s team continued their exceptional form.
Saka on the spot
Saka has now scored as many Premier League goals this season (14 in 29 matches) as he did in 2022-23 (14 in 38 encounters).
His successfully converted penalty here means he has now scored nine of his last 10 spot-kicks in the Premier League, including his last five in a row.
With Euros 2024 on the horizon, it is indeed timely to brush up on goalscoring output – especially from the spot. 
Brighton bereft as fine home record falls
Disappointingly for Brighton, this defeat at the hands of Arsenal ends a fine run of form on home turf.
Before this, the last defeat at the Amex came 3-1 to West Ham United in August. The clipping of the Seagulls’ wings now means that a 12-game unbeaten run, their longest unbeaten run at the Amex in the Premier League, draws to a close (W6 D6)."

Onana slides in on Anderson driving down the left, and the Team_15 man goes down and wins a free-kick.\nThere\'s a brief pause in play for the players to break their Ramadan fast.\nTeam_9 have been a lot more subdued since going behind. The hosts are controlling the game, with 66% of the possession, and looking much more dangerous.\nAnderson and Guimaraes get in each other\'s way a little in midfield. Anderson tries to get into space and wins a free kick after getting shoved over, near the Team_15 box.\nAnderson drives down the centre and squares it to Barnes, but there\'s a sea of blue shirts in the box to block and after a bit of pinball Team_9 head it clear.\nMassive chance for Murphy! Team_9 are camped out in their box and Murphy takes his chance to sprint through and have a shot from range - but it fizzes over the bar! Team_15 have had six attempts now to Team_9 two and are bringing all the intensity.\nNow Beto has a go for the visitors! He gets into a good position but his shot from the edge of the box is miles off target. Sean Dyche does not look impressed.\nGuimaraes and Gueye get in an elaborate tangle and the Brazilian hauls him over, giving away a free kick in the centre. Nothing comes of it and Barnes attempts to break, but Team_9 regain possession - Beto tries to cut it back, possibly for Doucoure, but his accuracy is way off again and Team_15 recover it easily.\nIsak\'s attempt to pass to Barnes down the left, frustrated by the Team_9 midfield, is greeted with appreciation by the crowd. Their star man has now scored in each of his last five Premier League home games, the first player to do so since Yoan Gouffran in 2013.\nTeam_9 once again are asleep at the back as Isak and Anderson again combine dangerously in the box, but Godfrey makes a great clearance to save their blushes. The resulting corner is flicked over by Burn for an Team_9 goal-kick.\nBarnes makes another electric run down the left but Tarkowski arrests it and concedes a throw-in. In another worrying sight for Eddie Howe, Hall is down on the pitch, holding onto his ribs. Medical staff are on the pitch - is this yet another injury setback for the Magpies?\nPlay resumes. Guimaraes and Anderson wrestle with Team_9 over a corner and the latter goes down courtesy of Doucoure. Team_9 have possession now, but McNeil\'s ball goes nowhere.\nBeto gets a talking to for a lunge on Krafth. Still no yellow cards in this game despite some feisty challenges. Hall is back up and appears to be moving well.\nChance for Team_9! Doucoure finds some space in the box and has a good attempt, but Dubravka jumps and gets his gloves to it. That\'s the most positive Team_9 have looked all game!\nHuge stop by Pickford! After a calmer period of Team_15 possession the ball falls to Barnes at the far left - he gets it around Pickford, who\'s off his line, but no one can get a decent touch on it. Murphy then has a go himself and the Team_9 goalkeeper sticks out a leg to keep it out!\nFour added minutes here at St James\' Park.\nHuge chance for Team_15 and Isak almost has a second! He glides through the defence and has a glorious chance to put the hosts 2-0 up, but it floats just over the bar.\nMurphy swings in a cross and Pickford does well to collect just a couple of yards out from goal!\nHALF-TIME: Team_15 1-0 Team_9.\nTeam_15 are 1-0 up at the break! Both sides have had chances, but the hosts - roared on by the crowd - have looked much the brighter, led by star player Isak, who showed his worth with a brilliant strike in the opening 15 minutes. The Magpies have controlled the game well, with 62 per cent of possession compared to Team_9 38, and an xG of 1.37 to the Toffees\' 0.47.\nTeam_9 need to turn this around quickly, and while they\'ve threatened on the break, Team_15 haven\'t looked too troubled by their efforts so far. Worryingly for the visitors, they haven\'t won any of their last 25 Premier League games when trailing at half-time. They also failed to have a shot on target in that entire half - let\'s see if Dyche\'s half-time pep talk has any effect...\nKICK-OFF: Team_15 1-0 Team_9. Second half underway!\nNo changes at the break. Team_9 nick possession early on and Young hoofs a cross in towards Beto, but it doesn\'t quite find the target. A minute later Beto goes down in the box thanks to a shirt-pull by Schar but the ref is stone-faced to his appeals.\nAlmost a very embarrassing moment for Team_9! Team_15 have a corner and the box is rammed. Tarkowski tries to clear but kicks it backwards onto his own post! It bounces away but wow, that could have been a disastrous start to this half!\nBranthwaite chucks a long ball in the vague direction of Doucoure, approaching a near-empty Team_15 box, but Team_9 don\'t have the pace at the moment to make anything of it.\nGuimaraes opts to leave a ball in his own penalty area and Beto launches towards it, sliding it on an approaching Dubravka. The keeper gets to it without much hassle but seems to clip his gloves on the Team_9 man in the process. Further up the pitch, Burn shoves McNeil over and concedes a free-kick.\nPickford takes the free-kick and sends it flying down towards the Team_15 box but the danger is cleared easily. Team_9 have a corner...\nMcNeil chips in the corner but it\'s rather flat and is cleared away. Team_9 have come out more strongly in this half, offering more in the opposition box. Tarkowski fires in a long ball but Onana, surrounded by Team_15 defenders, can\'t get his head to it and it sails behind.\nTeam_15 take a free kick, Isak squares the pass cutely to Dan Burn and the 6\'7"" centre-back fires it home! But wait... It\'s gone to VAR... They\'re checking for an offside on Isak.\nDecision made: Burn\'s goal is chalked off. Isak was leaning just a fraction too far forward beyond the Team_9 defence.\nDyche decides now is the time to make some changes. Doucoure is replaced by Gomes.\nOnana comes off for James Garner.\nAnd a final change for Team_9: the misfiring Beto is replaced by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. The latter hasn\'t scored in 23 games: can he break that streak here and get his side back in it?\nTeam_9 enjoy a spell of possession but Team_15 break! Pickford comes out to see to a long ball.\nCalvert-Lewin jumps for a cross but Dubravka gets there first and catches!\nAlmost an equaliser for Team_9! Garner - who has come on full of energy - spins on the ball and fires a brilliant first-time shot, but it bounces off the inside of the post! Huge, huge chance for Team_9.\nChance after chance for Team_15! It\'s absolute madness in the Team_9 box, Pickford is nowhere to be seen but Team_9 defend with their lives and Mykolenko clears Isak\'s shot just off the line - how is this still 1-0?! Barnes now fires another shot clear over the bar from a Krafth cross!\nEnd-to-end stuff at the moment, Team_9 really energised by their substitutions. Mykolenko attempts to pass to McNeil in the box but Krafth knocks it out for an corner. It\'s floated to the back post, out to a central position where Young is waiting - but his fierce attempt is blocked by a defender.\nEddie Howe decides now is the time to make a change. Anderson is replaced by Joe Willock.\nSchar slides in on Mykolenko to stop him advancing on goal. Team_9 are really ramping up the pressure now, Team_15 know their lead is slim and they can\'t sit this one out.\nLongstaff does well to rob Garner of the ball and set up Willock on the break. Isak dances through the defence and passes to Barnes, but his effort is well saved by Pickford.\nGodfrey knocks the ball behind and Team_15 have a corner. It\'s getting a bit feisty - Burn and Branthwaite are pushing and shoving each other in the box. Murphy\'s ball in is booted clear by Gomes.\nCalvert-Lewin sprints forward in acres of space but with no-one to pass to in the box, he takes too much time and Burn gets to him and takes out the danger. Dummett looks to be readying himself - Hall is down on the turf again so may be about to be replaced.\nHall is indeed coming off, replaced by Paul Dummett, making a rare appearance.\nInto the last 11 minutes. In the reverse fixture Team_9 scored three goals in that time - is this game going to have an equally dramatic end?\nThe first yellow of the game goes to Tarkowski for stepping on the back of Murphy\'s heel.\nAnother change for Team_9: Portuguese youngster Youssef Chermiti replaces Gueye.\nChermiti\'s first action of the game is to trip up Krafth. Murphy is limping around, testing his heel - that looked like it hurt. Burn makes an excellent challenge to halt Chermiti\'s run on goal in its tracks.\nGuimaraes boots a shot way over the bar. Late drama: VAR are checking for a possible penalty for Team_9 down the other end... Dummett hauled down Young by the neck in the box with the ball nowhere in sight. Could the visitors get a lifeline here?\nTony Harrington is being called to the screen...\nPENALTY GIVEN! Team_9 DO get a lifeline! The ball is going nowhere near Young and Dummett, with his arm round his neck, hauls him down regardless. Calvert-Lewin to take - can he end his goal drought here and revitalise his season?\nGOOOOAAAALLLL! Calvert-Lewin scores a penalty to make it 1-1! His powerful spot-kick clatters off Dubvraka\'s hand and into the back of the net - it\'s a huge, huge moment for Team_9, is the comeback? Huge for Calvert-Lewin as well, his first goal in 23 games.\nAnother change from Team_9, looking to capitalise on that equaliser. Godfrey is replaced by Seamus Coleman.\nThere will be NINE MINUTES of added time. Team_15 pushing...\nSchar takes down Calvert-Lewin near the sideline, who goes flying straight into the Toffees manager. Seconds later Team_9 have a corner.\nTarkowski and Calvert-Lewin were both well-positioned to receive that but the whistle blew for some argy-bargy in the box.\nLongstaff and Isak both in the Team_9 box trying to get a decent touch but Garner is there to marshal the defence. Both sides are pushing for a winner here with the St James\' crowd roaring their players on. It deflects out for a Team_15 corner...\nMurphy takes but the whistle blows - possibly before the corner was taken - as Burn shoves over Branthwaite. It\'s getting scrappy in the box and Tarkowski is remonstrating with the ref, annoyed at having to set up again.\nMurphy takes it again, Burn and Branthwaite are - again - grappling in the box, but it\'s cleared out. Someone looked to have gone down in the box but the ref isn\'t interested.\nChermiti receives a yellow for a challenge on Schar.\nGuimaraes takes the free kick and floats it towards Burn; Chermiti wins it back, Guimaraes is there once again and McNeil sees yellow for taking him down.\nGuimaraes takes the free-kick, Branthwaite knocks it clear, and after a bit of pinball it comes into the hands of Pickford.\nAnd that\'s the last action of the game!\nFULL-TIME: Team_15 1-1 Team_9.\nWhat a breathless end to that half! It ends 1-1, but Team_15 will be ruing that as a missed opportunity when they should have put the game to bed in a dominant first half. A glorious solo strike by Isak put the hosts in front after just 15 minutes, and he should have had a second shortly before the half-time whistle. But Team_9, who had been flat since going behind, regrouped at the break and some inspired substitutions made the second half altogether more competitive. This was a game largely decided by two substitutes: Dummett, making a rare appearance for Team_15, hacked down Young in the box and conceded a penalty, and Team_9 sub Calvert-Lewin - who has scored more goals against Team_15, six, than any other side - levelled from the spot with his first goal since October. Team_15 had 60 per cent possession and an xG of 1.42 compared to the Toffees\' 0.44, but couldn\'t capitalise, and Team_9 come away with a crucial point in their battle to avoid the drop.

93574	Brighton	Everton	2024-02-24	American Express Stadium, Falmer	31646.0	Tony Harrington		"Everton were denied a first win in nine Premier League matches as Lewis Dunk scored a stoppage-time equaliser for 10-man Brighton & Hove Albion to claim.
Sean Dyche’s team had led by a well-hit Jarrad Branthwaite shot at the Amex Stadium but despite the Seagulls going down to 10 men, Dunk, on his 400th appearance for the club, guided a fine header past Jordan Pickford in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
How the match unfolded
Robert De Zerbi made two changes from the side that thrashed Sheffield United 5-0, with Igor Julio and Evan Ferguson coming in for Adam Webster and Kaoru Mitoma. As for Everton, Dyche recalled Jack Harrison, with Ashley Young dropping to the bench.
Brighton assumed control of the match, dominating possession and playing out from the back to evade Everton’s press. The Seagulls came close from a through-ball by Pascal Gross to Danny Welbeck, who could not poke the ball past an onrushing Jordan Pickford.

Welbeck had another opportunity after a midfield turnover but a brilliant sliding challenge by Ben Godfrey deflected his shot for a corner.
Everton in the first half  seemed content to soak up the pressure in the hope of catching the home team on a counter but their opportunities were few. The best came from Dominic Calvert-Lewin, whose glancing header went narrowly wide.
But in the second half Everton started as the brighter team, Abdoulaye Doucoure’s sidefoot volley beating goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen but not a fine headed goalline clearance from Tariq Lamptey, the shortest player in the league at 5ft 4in.
What had been a steady match of possession became an end-to-end affair and Everton took the lead from a set-piece. Pickford launched a ball into the box that fell to Branthwaite, who arrowed it into the top corner.
Matters went from bad to worse for Brighton as Billy Gilmour received his first career red card for a high tackle on Amadou Onana. 
Everton substitute Beto had a chance to double the lead but could not convert a through-ball.
Despite their man disadvantage Brighton pressed for an equaliser and Pascal Gross delivered a perfect cross from the right to allow Dunk loop a header past the outstretched hands of Pickford.
Brighton now have 39 points, five behind Manchester United in sixth. The point lifts Everton above Luton and out of the bottom three.

93509	Newcastle	Nott'm Forest	2023-12-26	St. James' Park, Newcastle	52207.0	Chris Kavanagh	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Newcastle United and Fulham at St James' Park.
It has been a rough couple of weeks for Newcastle, who have lost their last three in a row in all competitions. The most recent of those was a 2-1 loss to Milan in midweek that saw their hopes of Champions League progression ended, and Eddie Howe will be hoping for a response from his players here to boost the Magpies' chances of European qualification come the end of the season.
Fulham, meanwhile, arrive at St James' Park very much in form, winning three of their last four, including the last two by a 5-0 scoreline. All three of those wins came at Craven Cottage, though, and the Londoners will be bidding to win for just the second time away from home in the Premier League this season.
NEWCASTLE UNITED (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Valentino Livramento, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schar, Dan Burn; Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton; Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson, Anthony Gordon.
SUBS: Lewis Hall, Alex Murphy, Lewis Miley, Mark Gillespie, Loris Karius, Paul Dummett, Emil Krafth, Sven Botman, Matt Ritchie.
FULHAM (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Timothy Castagne, Tosin Adarabioyo, Issa Diop, Antonee Robinson; Joao Palhinha, Tom Cairney; Alex Iwobi, Andreas Pereira, Harry Wilson; Raul Jimenez.
SUBS: Fode Ballo-Toure, Rodrigo Muniz, Carlos Vinicius, Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Harrison Reed, Marek Rodak, Kenny Tete, Sasa Lukic, Willian.
Howe makes two changes from the side that started the defeat to Milan, with Burn fit enough to play from the off for the first time since early November. He comes in for the suspended Kieran Trippier, while Longstaff starts ahead of Miley in midfield. Botman returns on the bench having missed time through injury, while Alexander Isak is absent from the squad.
Marco Silva also goes with two alterations from his team's last outing, a 5-0 thumping of West Ham. Willian went off injured in that win and drops to the bench here, with Wilson the man to start in his place. Calvin Bassey misses out through illness, with Diop coming in for him. Jimenez starts up top having scored three times in Fulham's last two matches.
The two sets of players make their way onto the pitch at St James' Park ahead of this vital Premier League clash. Can Newcastle get back to winning ways? Or will Fulham continue their purple patch? We will find out shortly!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way in Newcastle!
Newcastle are looking to get on the front foot early on, with Fulham largely penned back so far. Howe will be desperate for an early goal as his team look to respond to their European disappointment.
WIDE! Schar tries his luck with a free-kick from range, though his curling effort does not quite bend enough and arrows past the right post. Leno looked to have it covered anyway, but it is yet more encouragement for the hosts.
Newcastle breathe a sigh of relief as a swift Fulham move ends with Wilson cutting the ball back into the danger area. Fortunately for the hosts, Livramento is well-placed to get to the ball first and clear upfield.
Adarabioyo brings down Wilson near the corner of the Fulham penalty area, and Newcastle will have a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Who will be trusted to take it?
It's really poor from Gordon, who does not get enough height on his free-kick, which allows a Fulham defender to hook clear. Howe will be frustrated at how his side have wasted that great set-piece opportunity.
It looks like Howe will be forced into an early change here as Schar pulls up while dribbling out from the back. He grabs at his hamstring immediately, and the centre-back will surely have to make way.
Schar does indeed limp off, and Krafth enters the field in his place. Interestingly, Howe opted for Krafth over Botman, who has not played since late September because of a knee injury.
Newcastle are unbeaten in their last six Premier League meetings with Fulham (four wins, two draws), winning the last three in a row.
Guimaraes spurns a decent opportunity as Gordon cuts the ball back to him on the edge of the box. The midfielder opts to shoot first time, but his effort flies high and wide of the target.
Jimenez momentarily requires some treatment after being caught with a stray arm by Lascelles as the two battled for possession. The striker is okay to continue, however, which will be a big boost for Silva.
Jimenez receives the first booking of the game after a bizarre challenge on Longstaff. The ball was long gone by the time Jimenez clattered into Longstaff, with the striker's hip hitting the Newcastle man in the face. There will be a VAR check, however, to see whether Jimenez's challenge is worthy of a red card instead...
RED CARD!!! JIMENEZ IS SENT OFF!!! The VAR review rules that the striker's challenge was indeed dangerous, and Jimenez is given his marching orders. He can have little complaints after a hugely unnecessary tackle.
Newcastle will really fancy their chances now of coming away with three points. They have been the better side so far, and their numerical advantage can surely only help matters.
As you would expect, Fulham are now looking to get bodies behind the ball and make themselves hard to break down. Their striker's daft challenge has really left them in the lurch here, and there may be some uncomfortable conversations in the dressing room after the game should the Cottagers go on to lose this match.
Fulham are winless in seven Premier League away games against Newcastle (three draws, four defeats) since a 1-0 win in May 2009 under Roy Hodgson. Down to 10 men, that winless streak looks unlikely to end here.
OFF THE BAR!!! SO CLOSE FOR GORDON!!! Newcastle are inches away from taking the lead as a deep cross finds its way to Gordon at the back post. He brings the ball down before lashing goalwards, but the winger's powerful effort comes off the underside of the bar, with Fulham eventually able to scramble clear.
A rare foray forward for Fulham ends with Palhinha trying his luck from distance, but his shot never looks like troubling Dubravka, who makes a comfortable save.
Wilson nips in front of his defender to get on the end of Gordon's delivery from the left, but his header is straight down the throat of Leno. That is the striker's first sniff of goal in this game.
CHANCE! A huge chance for Fulham goes begging as a neat throughball for Iwobi puts him in on goal. He is forced a little wide, and his eventual shot is poor as Dubravka makes a routine stop. The visitors will need to make more of situations like that if they are to come away with a result here.
Incredibly, Newcastle may have yet another injury issue to worry about as Joelinton is forced off. 17-year-old Miley is on his place, and the youngster has really stepped up of late in the face of so many midfield injury problems.
Newcastle's 4-1 defeat at Tottenham last time out was their sixth Premier League defeat of the season, already more than they suffered in the whole of 2022-23 (five).
Five minutes to go until the interval, and so far Newcastle have not quite been able to break through the Fulham resistance despite their numerical advantage. The Cottagers have even had a couple of opportunities on the break.
NO PENALTY! Livramento fires a ball into the box, and Longstaff's heavy touch at the near post allows Leno to race out and snuff out the danger. However, Wilson goes down under the challenge of Adarabioyo off the ball, and a VAR review checks whether there was enough contact to warrant a penalty. However, the on-field decision of no penalty is confirmed.
There will be eight minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Krafth's delivery picks out Gordon in the Fulham penalty area, but the winger has to lean back to get his head to the ball, and his eventual effort ends up flying high over the crossbar.
Fulham have scored 16 goals in their last four Premier League games, one more than they had in their previous 15 combined. They have drawn a blank so far here, though.
Pereira briefly goes down in the Fulham box after a clash with Gordon, though the former Manchester United man is okay to continue. That was a welcome pause for the visitors, who will be desperate to get to the break with their clean sheet intact.
Now it's Wilson who looks to have a bit of a problem, momentarily dropping to his haunches. Fulham need the interval here.
HALF-TIME: NEWCASTLE 0-0 FULHAM
The half-time whistle blows as Newcastle and 10-man Fulham head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 0-0 at St James' Park. The hosts started the brighter and were handed a huge boost with 22 minutes gone as the in-form Jimenez saw red after a bizarre and dangerous challenge on Longstaff. However, Fulham's resistance was stubborn, though Gordon was inches away from putting Newcastle in front when he thumped off the bar. Silva's men would survive, though, as the sides head to the break goalless.
With their opposition down to 10, this will feel a huge missed opportunity for Newcastle should they not go on and win this game. They created 0.96 xG (expected goals) to Fulham's 0.18 in that first half, but Howe will be demanding more from his side in the second 45 minutes to ensure they kick on and secure three points.
The hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half. Can they take advantage of their numerical advantage and find a winner?
A bright start to the second half sees Miley win a corner. The opportunity is wasted, however, as Almiron's delivery flies over the head of all of his team-mates and bounces out for a goal-kick.
Howe will want to get Wilson more involved in the second half. The striker attempted just three passes in the opening 45 minutes, failing to complete one.
Guimaraes stings the palms of Leno with a powerful long-range effort, though the Fulham goalkeeper is able to gather at the second attempt.
BIG SAVE! Leno makes a vital stop to keep the scoreline 0-0. Wilson brings a cross down before laying the ball back for Gordon, though the winger's curling first-time effort is parried by a strong left hand of Leno.
Leno makes another decent stop to deny Miley. Newcastle are really starting to pile on the pressure now, and the home crowd are responding as they show their appreciation. Howe will be pleased with this start to the second half.
Gordon slides a neat ball into the path of Almiron in the Fulham box, though Diop gets across brilliantly to make a vital last-ditch block and divert behind for a corner. The resulting set-piece comes to nothing, but it is all Newcastle at the minute.
GOOOAAALLL!!! MILEY GIVES NEWCASTLE THE LEAD!!! What a moment for the 17-year-old as he puts the Magpies in front with his first ever goal for the senior side! Guimaraes plays a vital part, riding a couple of challenges and driving into the Fulham box. The ball eventually runs into the path of Miley, who keeps his composure to fire into the far corner and put the hosts 1-0 up at St James' Park!
Miley finished it off, but Guimaraes created that goal. His persistent run took the ball deep into the Fulham box before his young midfield partner lashed home.
Fulham have failed to win in their last 20 matches when conceding the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to October 23, 2022 against Leeds United. A man down, that streak looks unlikely to end here.
Silva responds to going a goal behind with a pair of changes. The first sees Tete come on for Pereira, who has not been at his creative best here, failing to create a chance during his time on the pitch.
Muniz enters the fray for Castagne in an attacking change. The former Flamengo man is only just returning from a knee injury having been absent since early November.
GOOOAAALLL!!! ALMIRON MAKES IT 2-0!!! Almiron potentially puts the game to bed with one of the easiest finishes of his career. More good work from Gordon sees him slide a neat pass into the path of Wilson. The striker, Robinson and Leno all converge on the ball, though it evades all of them and runs through to Almiron. The Paraguay international makes no mistake, stroking into the empty net to put his side two goals to the good. There is a brief VAR check with Wilson potentially offside during the build-up, though the goal is eventually given!
Gordon gets his fourth assist of the Premier League season, though Almiron was surely not his intended target.
Aged 17 years and 229 days, Miley is the youngest player to score for Newcastle in the Premier League. He is the competition's youngest scorer since Federico Macheda for Manchester United in April 2009 (17 years, 226 days).
Two goals to the good, Newcastle are showing no signs of slowing down as they go in pursuit of a third that would surely make the points safe.
Palhinha goes in the book for dissent after disagreeing with the referee's decision to award a foul against him in midfield.
Fulham have their first foray forward in a while as they look for a way back into the game, though Cairney's free-kick is caught by Dubravka.
Since beating Everton 1-0 on the opening weekend, Fulham are winless in their last seven Premier League away games (three draws, four losses). They last had a longer winless run on the road in the same campaign in their first 17 of 2018-19 (two draws, 15 defeats).
Cairney trudges off as Lukic enters the fray.
Iwobi, who spurned a golden opportunity at 0-0, is replaced by De Cordova-Reid.
Silva makes a trio of changes. Palhinha is the first to make way, with Reed on in his place.
Muniz, who made his return from injury off the bench, is down in his team's box and looks in pain. Silva has used all of his substitutions, so he will be keen for Muniz to get back to his feet.
Muniz is back to his feet, a big boost for Silva and Fulham. Can they find a way back into this contest? A goal back and this could get interesting.
De Cordova-Reid goes in the book for a foul on Krafth down Newcastle's right.
GOOOAAALLL!!! BURN MAKES IT 3-0!!! The defender marks his return from injury with a goal as he makes the points safe. A free-kick is cleared, but only back out to Guimaraes. With a delightful outside-of-the-boot cross, Guimaraes picks out Burn at the back post, who sees his first header saved before bundling home the rebound to put his side three goals to the good!
With the game surely won, Howe rings the changes. Livramento has been impressive but now makes way for Ritchie.
Having just scored, Burn trudges off for Botman. The Dutchman receives a warm welcome onto the pitch, having last played for Newcastle back in late September in the 8-0 win over Sheffield United.
Another fine outing for Gordon is over as he comes off for Hall for the final six or so minutes.
Fulham have created just 0.02 xG in this second half, while Newcastle have accumulated 2.64. It has been very one-sided since the interval.
Fulham look a beaten side now. Their first-half resistance was stubborn, but they have been carved open on a number of occasions in this second 45 minutes and look on course for defeat.
There will be seven minutes of additional time at the end of this match, though it has been over as a contest for a while now.
Newcastle are still probing for a fourth goal here. Wilson is yet to get on the scoresheet, and he will be one of those looking for a goal in these dying seconds.
OFF THE POST!!! Wilson is inches away from getting his goal as he brings the ball under his spell before lashing goalwards, though his shot comes back off the post and away from danger!
Almiron's deep cross finds Ritchie at the back post, but the substitute's volley from a tight angle is saved by Leno to save further Fulham embarrassment.
FULL-TIME: NEWCASTLE UNITED 3-0 FULHAM
The full-time whistle blows at St James' Park as Newcastle celebrate a much-needed 3-0 victory over 10-man Fulham. It was comfortable in the end, though the visitors did put up a decent fight after Jimenez saw red 22 minutes in for a bizarre challenge on Longstaff. Silva's men made it to the break level, but their resistance was broken with 57 minutes on the clock as persistent work from Guimaraes ended with Miley lashing home for his first ever senior Newcastle goal. Almiron made it 2-0 not long after, before Burn made the points safe on his return from injury as he bundled home Guimaraes' cross at the second attempt. Howe's men win for the first time in four games in all competitions, moving them onto 29 points and ahead of Manchester United. The victory comes at some cost, though, with Schar and Joelinton both limping off, worsening the Magpies' already horrendous injury crisis. Fulham remain on 21 points, still 12 points above the bottom three. They will look to get back on track when they travel to Goodison Park to take on Everton in the EFL Cup quarter-final on Tuesday, while Newcastle will look to reach the last four of that competition when they visit Chelsea the same day. That is all we have for you from St James' Park, so thanks for your company and goodbye!"	"Chris Wood made a devastating return to St James’ Park, scoring a hat-trick against his former club to give Nuno Espirito Santo his first win as Nottingham Forest head coach and inflict on Newcastle United a fourth defeat in five Premier League matches.
Newcastle initially took the lead as Alexander Isak won and converted a penalty, but Wood levelled at the end of the first half and then netted again in the 53rd and 60th minutes, stunning Newcastle fans who had watched him score just once in 18 top-flight matches in St James’ Park as a Newcastle player.
Wood is only the second Forest player to score a Premier League hat-trick, after Kevin Campbell in 1996, while he is the first player to score a top-flight treble on Boxing Day for six years, and the seventh overall.
Forest’s victory, in Nuno’s second match in charge, takes them five points clear of the relegation zone.
How the match unfolded
Newcastle made two changes from Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Luton Town, with Sven Botman replacing the injured Jamaal Lascelles and Alexander Isak being given the nod up top instead of Callum Wilson.
Nuno Espirto Santo, in his second match in charge, reshuffled his team and made six changes from the 3-2 loss against AFC Bournemouth three days ago. 
Newcastle were fortunate not to fall behind early when Morgan Gibbs-White won the ball back inside their penalty box before shooting just wide of Martin Dubravka’s left post.
But the home side were by far the dominant side and in the 20th minute Alexander Isak received a pass from Lewis Miley, spun Ola Aina and won his side a penalty before stepping up and placing it in the bottom-right corner three minutes later.
Forest were still a threat though and should have levelled proceedings when Anthony Elanga opted to shoot after being played in when Chris Wood was unmarked and would have had the simple task of putting the ball into the net had Elanga squared teh pass to him.
Elanga didn’t make the same mistake again though and after receiving a pass from Gibbs-White, he played the ball across the box and Wood was on hand to score against his former club.
Minutes later, Newcastle came very close to retaking their lead when Turner spilled Isak’s header, but he recovered in time to palm the ball away from Miguel Almiron.
The end-to-end action would continue in the second half and within 30 seconds after the break, Gibbs-White headed a glorious chance wide.
And incredibly Nottingham Forest took the lead as Wood scored a sensational goal in front of the Gallowgate End. Newcastle lost possession in the final third and Elanga received a pass before playing in Wood in the left channel, he still had a lot of work to do before scoring but the Forest striker did superbly to sit Dan Burn down before clipping the ball into the right corner of the net.
The afternoon would then get better for Wood, who claimed the match ball after receiving a long-range pass from Murillo and then keeping himself onside before rounding Dubravka.
The 32-year-old became only the fourth player to score a hat-trick against a former club after Andy Cole against Newcastle, Marcus Bent against Blackburn Rovers and Josh King against Everton."	Team_15		"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_15 and Team_10 at St James' Park.\nIt has been a rough couple of weeks for Team_15, who have lost their last three in a row in all competitions. The most recent of those was a 2-1 loss to Milan in midweek that saw their hopes of Champions League progression ended, and Eddie Howe will be hoping for a response from his players here to boost the Magpies'\xa0chances of European qualification come the end of the season.\nTeam_10, meanwhile, arrive at St James' Park very much in form, winning three of their last four, including the last two by a 5-0 scoreline. All three of those wins came at Craven Cottage, though, and the Londoners will be bidding to win for just the second time away from home in the Premier League this season.\nTeam_15 (4-3-3): Martin Dubravka; Valentino Livramento, Jamaal Lascelles, Fabian Schar, Dan Burn; Sean Longstaff, Bruno Guimaraes, Joelinton; Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson, Anthony Gordon.\nSUBS: Lewis Hall, Alex Murphy, Lewis Miley, Mark Gillespie, Loris Karius, Paul Dummett, Emil Krafth, Sven Botman, Matt Ritchie.\nTeam_10 (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Timothy Castagne, Tosin Adarabioyo, Issa Diop, Antonee Robinson; Joao Palhinha, Tom Cairney; Alex Iwobi, Andreas Pereira, Harry Wilson; Raul Jimenez.\nSUBS: Fode Ballo-Toure, Rodrigo Muniz, Carlos Vinicius, Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Harrison Reed, Marek Rodak, Kenny Tete, Sasa Lukic, Willian.\nHowe makes two changes from the side that started the defeat to Milan, with Burn fit enough to play from the off for the first time since early November. He comes in for the suspended Kieran Trippier, while Longstaff starts ahead of Miley in midfield. Botman returns on the bench having missed time through injury, while Alexander Isak is absent from the squad.\nMarco Silva also goes with two alterations from his team's last outing, a 5-0 thumping of Team_19. Willian went off injured in that win and drops to the bench here, with Wilson the man to start in his place. Calvin Bassey misses out through illness, with Diop coming in for him. Jimenez starts up top having scored three times in Team_10 last two matches.\nThe two sets of players make their way onto the pitch at St James' Park ahead of this vital Premier League clash. Can Team_15 get back to winning ways? Or will Team_10 continue their purple patch? We will find out shortly!\nThe visitors kick us off and we are under way in Team_15!\nTeam_15 are looking to get on the front foot early on, with Team_10 largely penned back so far. Howe will be desperate for an early goal as his team look to respond to their European disappointment.\nWIDE! Schar tries his luck with a free-kick from range, though his curling effort does not quite bend enough and arrows past the right post. Leno looked to have it covered anyway, but it is yet more encouragement for the hosts.\nTeam_15 breathe a sigh of relief as a swift Team_10 move ends with Wilson cutting the ball back into the danger area. Fortunately for the hosts, Livramento is well-placed to get to the ball first and clear upfield.\nAdarabioyo brings down Wilson near the corner of the Team_10 penalty area, and Team_15 will have a free-kick in a very dangerous position. Who will be trusted to take it?\nIt's really poor from Gordon, who does not get enough height on his free-kick, which allows a Team_10 defender to hook clear. Howe will be frustrated at how his side have wasted that great set-piece opportunity.\nIt looks like Howe will be forced into an early change here as Schar pulls up while dribbling out from the back. He grabs at his hamstring immediately, and the centre-back will surely have to make way.\nSchar does indeed limp off, and Krafth enters the field in his place. Interestingly, Howe opted for Krafth over Botman, who has not played since late September because of a knee injury.\nTeam_15 are unbeaten in their last six Premier League meetings with Team_10 (four wins, two draws), winning the last three in a row.\nGuimaraes spurns a decent opportunity as Gordon cuts the ball back to him on the edge of the box. The midfielder opts to shoot first time, but his effort flies high and wide of the target.\nJimenez momentarily requires some treatment after being caught with a stray arm by Lascelles as the two battled for possession. The striker is okay to continue, however, which will be a big boost for Silva.\nJimenez receives the first booking of the game after a bizarre challenge on Longstaff. The ball was long gone by the time Jimenez clattered into Longstaff, with the striker's hip hitting the Team_15 man in the face. There will be a VAR check, however, to see whether Jimenez's challenge is worthy of a red card instead...\nRED CARD!!! JIMENEZ IS SENT OFF!!! The VAR review rules that the striker's challenge was indeed dangerous, and Jimenez is given his marching orders. He can have little complaints after a hugely unnecessary tackle.\nTeam_15 will really fancy their chances now of coming away with three points. They have been the better side so far, and their numerical advantage can surely only help matters.\nAs you would expect, Team_10 are now looking to get bodies behind the ball and make themselves hard to break down. Their striker's daft challenge has really left them in the lurch here, and there may be some uncomfortable conversations in the dressing room after the game should the Cottagers go on to lose this match.\nTeam_10 are winless in seven Premier League away games against Team_15 (three draws, four defeats) since a 1-0 win in May 2009 under Roy Hodgson. Down to 10 men, that winless streak looks unlikely to end here.\nOFF THE BAR!!! SO CLOSE FOR GORDON!!! Team_15 are inches away from taking the lead as a deep cross finds its way to Gordon at the back post. He brings the ball down before lashing goalwards, but the winger's powerful effort comes off the underside of the bar, with Team_10 eventually able to scramble clear.\nA rare foray forward for Team_10 ends with Palhinha trying his luck from distance, but his shot never looks like troubling Dubravka, who makes a comfortable save.\nWilson nips in front of his defender to get on the end of Gordon's delivery from the left, but his header is straight down the throat of Leno. That is the striker's first sniff of goal in this game.\nCHANCE! A huge chance for Team_10 goes begging as a neat throughball for Iwobi puts him in on goal. He is forced a little wide, and his eventual shot is poor as Dubravka makes a routine stop. The visitors will need to make more of situations like that if they are to come away with a result here.\nIncredibly, Team_15 may have yet another injury issue to worry about as Joelinton is forced off. 17-year-old Miley is on his place, and the youngster has really stepped up of late in the face of so many midfield injury problems.\nTeam_15 4-1 defeat at Team_18 last time out was their sixth Premier League defeat of the season, already more than they suffered in the whole of 2022-23 (five).\nFive minutes to go until the interval, and so far Team_15 have not quite been able to break through the Team_10 resistance despite their numerical advantage. The Cottagers have even had a couple of opportunities on the break.\nNO PENALTY! Livramento fires a ball into the box, and Longstaff's heavy touch at the near post allows Leno to race out and snuff out the danger. However, Wilson goes down under the challenge of Adarabioyo off the ball, and a VAR review checks whether there was enough contact to warrant a penalty. However, the on-field decision of no penalty is confirmed.\nThere will be eight minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.\nKrafth's delivery picks out Gordon in the Team_10 penalty area, but the winger has to lean back to get his head to the ball, and his eventual effort ends up flying high over the crossbar.\nTeam_10 have scored 16 goals in their last four Premier League games, one more than they had in their previous 15 combined. They have drawn a blank so far here, though.\nPereira briefly goes down in the Team_10 box after a clash with Gordon, though the former Team_14 man is okay to continue. That was a welcome pause for the visitors, who will be desperate to get to the break with their clean sheet intact.\nNow it's Wilson who looks to have a bit of a problem, momentarily dropping to his haunches. Team_10 need the interval here.\nHALF-TIME: Team_15 0-0 Team_10\nThe half-time whistle blows as Team_15 and 10-man Team_10 head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 0-0 at St James' Park. The hosts started the brighter and were handed a huge boost with 22 minutes gone as the in-form Jimenez saw red after a bizarre and dangerous challenge on Longstaff. However, Team_10 resistance was stubborn, though Gordon was inches away from putting Team_15 in front when he thumped off the bar. Silva's men would survive, though, as the sides head to the break goalless.\nWith their opposition down to 10, this will feel a huge missed opportunity for Team_15 should they not go on and win this game. They created 0.96 xG (expected goals) to Team_10 0.18 in that first half, but Howe will be demanding more from his side in the second 45 minutes to ensure they kick on and secure three points.\nThe hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half. Can they take advantage of their numerical advantage and find a winner?\nA bright start to the second half sees Miley win a corner. The opportunity is wasted, however, as Almiron's delivery flies over the head of all of his team-mates and bounces out for a goal-kick.\nHowe will want to get Wilson more involved in the second half. The striker attempted just three passes in the opening 45 minutes, failing to complete one.\nGuimaraes stings the palms of Leno with a powerful long-range effort, though the Team_10 goalkeeper is able to gather at the second attempt.\nBIG SAVE! Leno makes a vital stop to keep the scoreline 0-0. Wilson brings a cross down before laying the ball back for Gordon, though the winger's curling first-time effort is parried by a strong left hand of Leno.\nLeno makes another decent stop to deny Miley. Team_15 are really starting to pile on the pressure now, and the home crowd are responding as they show their appreciation. Howe will be pleased with this start to the second half.\nGordon slides a neat ball into the path of Almiron in the Team_10 box, though Diop gets across brilliantly to make a vital last-ditch block and divert behind for a corner. The resulting set-piece comes to nothing, but it is all Team_15 at the minute.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! MILEY GIVES Team_15 THE LEAD!!! What a moment for the 17-year-old as he puts the Magpies in front with his first ever goal for the senior side! Guimaraes plays a vital part, riding a couple of challenges and driving into the Team_10 box. The ball eventually runs into the path of Miley, who keeps his composure to fire into the far corner and put the hosts 1-0 up at St James' Park!\nMiley finished it off, but Guimaraes created that goal. His persistent run took the ball deep into the Team_10 box before his young midfield partner lashed home.\nTeam_10 have failed to win in their last 20 matches when conceding the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to October 23, 2022 against Leeds United. A man down, that streak looks unlikely to end here.\nSilva responds to going a goal behind with a pair of changes. The first sees Tete come on for Pereira, who has not been at his creative best here, failing to create a chance during his time on the pitch.\nMuniz enters the fray for Castagne in an attacking change. The former Flamengo man is only just returning from a knee injury having been absent since early November.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! ALMIRON MAKES IT 2-0!!! Almiron potentially puts the game to bed with one of the easiest finishes of his career. More good work from Gordon sees him slide a neat pass into the path of Wilson. The striker, Robinson and Leno all converge on the ball, though it evades all of them and runs through to Almiron. The Paraguay international makes no mistake, stroking into the empty net to put his side two goals to the good. There is a brief VAR check with Wilson potentially offside during the build-up, though the goal is eventually given!\nGordon gets his fourth assist of the Premier League season, though Almiron was surely not his intended target.\nAged 17 years and 229 days, Miley is the youngest player to score for Team_15 in the Premier League. He is the competition's youngest scorer since Federico Macheda for Team_14 in April 2009 (17 years, 226 days).\nTwo goals to the good, Team_15 are showing no signs of slowing down as they go in pursuit of a third that would surely make the points safe.\nPalhinha goes in the book for dissent after disagreeing with the referee's decision to award a foul against him in midfield.\nTeam_10 have their first foray forward in a while as they look for a way back into the game, though Cairney's free-kick is caught by Dubravka.\nSince beating Team_9 1-0 on the opening weekend, Team_10 are winless in their last seven Premier League away games (three draws, four losses). They last had a longer winless run on the road in the same campaign in their first 17 of 2018-19 (two draws, 15 defeats).\nCairney trudges off as Lukic enters the fray.\nIwobi, who spurned a golden opportunity at 0-0, is replaced by De Cordova-Reid.\nSilva makes a trio of changes. Palhinha is the first to make way, with Reed on in his place.\nMuniz, who made his return from injury off the bench, is down in his team's box and looks in pain. Silva has used all of his substitutions, so he will be keen for Muniz to get back to his feet.\nMuniz is back to his feet, a big boost for Silva and Team_10. Can they find a way back into this contest? A goal back and this could get interesting.\nDe Cordova-Reid goes in the book for a foul on Krafth down Team_15 right.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! BURN MAKES IT 3-0!!! The defender marks his return from injury with a goal as he makes the points safe. A free-kick is cleared, but only back out to Guimaraes. With a delightful outside-of-the-boot cross, Guimaraes picks out Burn at the back post, who sees his first header saved before bundling home the rebound to put his side three goals to the good!\nWith the game surely won, Howe rings the changes. Livramento has been impressive but now makes way for Ritchie.\nHaving just scored, Burn trudges off for Botman. The Dutchman receives a warm welcome onto the pitch, having last played for Team_15 back in late September in the 8-0 win over Team_17.\nAnother fine outing for Gordon is over as he comes off for Hall for the final six or so minutes.\nTeam_10 have created just 0.02 xG in this second half, while Team_15 have accumulated 2.64. It has been very one-sided since the interval.\nTeam_10 look a beaten side now. Their first-half resistance was stubborn, but they have been carved open on a number of occasions in this second 45 minutes and look on course for defeat.\nThere will be seven minutes of additional time at the end of this match, though it has been over as a contest for a while now.\nTeam_15 are still probing for a fourth goal here. Wilson is yet to get on the scoresheet, and he will be one of those looking for a goal in these dying seconds.\nOFF THE POST!!! Wilson is inches away from getting his goal as he brings the ball under his spell before lashing goalwards, though his shot comes back off the post and away from danger!\nAlmiron's deep cross finds Ritchie at the back post, but the substitute's volley from a tight angle is saved by Leno to save further Team_10 embarrassment.\nFULL-TIME: Team_15 3-0 Team_10\nThe full-time whistle blows at St James' Park as Team_15 celebrate a much-needed 3-0 victory over 10-man Team_10. It was comfortable in the end, though the visitors did put up a decent fight after Jimenez saw red 22 minutes in for a bizarre challenge on Longstaff. Silva's men made it to the break level, but their resistance was broken with 57 minutes on the clock as persistent work from Guimaraes ended with Miley lashing home for his first ever senior Team_15 goal. Almiron made it 2-0 not long after, before Burn made the points safe on his return from injury as he bundled home Guimaraes' cross at the second attempt. Howe's men win for the first time in four games in all competitions, moving them onto 29 points and ahead of Team_14. The victory comes at some cost, though, with Schar and Joelinton both limping off, worsening the Magpies' already horrendous injury crisis. Team_10 remain on 21 points, still 12 points above the bottom three. They will look to get back on track when they travel to Goodison Park to take on Team_9 in the EFL Cup quarter-final on Tuesday, while Team_15 will look to reach the last four of that competition when they visit Team_7 the same day. That is all we have for you from St James' Park, so thanks for your company and goodbye!""]"	1	0	1	0	0	0	2	Exciting
93548	Man Utd	West Ham	2024-02-04	Old Trafford, Manchester	73612.0	Andy Madley	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Fulham and Everton at Craven Cottage.
Fulham will be hoping to continue their impressive home form of late, having won four of their last five Premier League games on their own turf. The Cottagers could climb into 12th place in the Premier League table with a win today, and they will likely be relying on Raul Jimenez to provide the goods in attack. The Mexican forward has scored more Premier League goals against Everton than he has against any other club (five). Fulham have failed to win in their last four fixtures, but three of those have come in cup competitions.
Everton travel to the capital to face Marco Silva’s Fulham. London has been kind to the Toffees so far this season having won three out of their four fixtures in the city (1L). Sean Dyche’s side are still fighting above the relegation zone despite their 10-point deduction earlier in the campaign, and a victory could see them go four points clear of the drop if results go their way. Only Liverpool and Manchester City, who are first and second in the Premier League respectively, have won more games on the road than Everton this season (five). The Merseyside outfit will be hoping to bounce back after being knocked out of the FA Cup by Luton Town at the weekend.
FULHAM (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Antonee Robinson, Issa Diop, Tosin Adarabioyo, Timothy Castagne; Tom Cairney, Joao Palhinha; Willian, Andreas Pereira, Bobby De Cordova-Reid; Raul Jimenez.
FULHAM SUBS: Marek Rodak, Kenny Tete, Harrison Reed, Tim Ream, Rodrigo Muniz, Sasa Lukic, Carlos Vinicius, Tyrese Francois, Kristian Sekularac.
EVERTON (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ben Godfrey; Arnaut Danjuma, Dwight McNeil, James Garner, Ashley Young; Jack Harrison; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Joao Virginia, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Mackenzie Hunt, Lewis Dobbin, Jenson Metcalfe.
Silva has made two changes from Fulham’s last Premier League fixture against Chelsea earlier in the month. At right-back, Tete has dropped to the bench, with Castagne coming into the starting XI. Further forward, De Cordova-Reid replaces Harry Wilson, who fails to make the squad.
Meanwhile, Dyche has made three alterations from Everton’s previous Premier League game against Aston Villa. Club captain Seamus Coleman misses out, so Young will return from injury to slot in on the right-hand side. Abdoulaye Doucoure and Amadou Onana are also unavailable, with Godfrey and McNeil coming into the starting XI.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Jimenez gets the game under way for Fulham at Craven Cottage!
What a chance! Godfrey receives his throw-in back from Young and hooks the ball into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin does well to hold off the defender and lays it into the path of Harrison just inside the box. The Everton winger strikes it, but he can't quite curl it into the far corner. He should be hitting the target from there!
It's been end-to-end stuff so far with both sides attempting two shots and taking a corner each. Fulham are clearly still trying to work out Everton, considering Dyche's side have one natural central midfielder on the pitch. McNeil is lining up in an unfamiliar central role, with Godfrey at right-back and Young just ahead of him on the right-hand side of midfield.
A switch of play hopes to find Robinson but Godfrey has come across to fire the ball out for a throw-in. Fulham take quickly and the ball eventually finds Castagne who delivers into the area. It's headed away by Godfrey but only as far as Robinson who strikes from outside the area, but Pickford is there to palm it behind for a corner.
Pereira has gone down clutching his face after barging into Tarkowski. The referee has stopped the game just in case he needs treatment, but he's quickly back on his feet. Elsewhere, Luton have scored twice in quick succession and are currently leading Brighton 2-0, plunging Everton into the relegation zone.
Fulham manage to break down the left-hand side after a deflected pass finds Jimenez. The Mexican forward drives into the box and looks to attempt an ambitious outside-of-the-boot cross towards the back post, but it evades all of his team-mates and goes off the side of the pitch for a throw-in to Everton.
McNeil wins the ball back for Everton in a dangerous area, but his pass goes straight to the feet of Robinson, whose clearance cannons off Young and Fulham win a throw-in. It was a real chance for the Toffees to create something, but they need to have more conviction in the final third of the pitch.
Everton win the ball back once again and it finds Danjuma who drives towards the penalty area. The Dutch forward has plenty of options to his left and right but attempts a highly ambitious effort from range, and it trickles into the arms of Leno. It's a shot on target, but the Fulham goalkeeper was hardly threatened.
Fulham are enjoying plenty of possession so far and have had 72.2 per cent of the ball. However, they've managed just two touches in the opposition box to Everton's seven, with the away side looking like more of a threat in the final third since the game got under way. Neither team have truly threatened the opposition's goal yet, though.
So close! Danjuma is adjudged to have handled the ball and Fulham win a free-kick. Pereira delivers into the penalty and Palhinha is there to meet it as he towers above Tarkowski, but he heads it over the bar. He will be disappointed not to have hit the target and tested Pickford between the sticks.
How has that not gone in?! From the resulting free-kick, Young whipped it into the penalty area and Leno was there to palm it away. Tarkowski strikes it back towards goal and it deflects onto the bar, before it's poked off the line by Robinson. It was inches away from going over the line, but the Toffees somehow fail to open the scoring!
Palhinha goes into the book for a late challenge on Harrison just outside the Fulham penalty area.
Danjuma, Harrison, and Young are standing over the free-kick in a dangerous position for Everton. Harrison is the one to take, but he drills the ball into the wall and the Fulham supporters breathe a sigh or relief. Godfrey then fouls his opponent and the Cottagers can regroup with a free-kick inside their own penalty area.
Fulham look to break with Willian on the left-hand side, but Godfrey pulls him back and the referee awards a yellow.
So close again for Everton! The Toffees hit Fulham on the counter-attack and a deflected pass from McNeil finds Danjuma. He cuts inside onto his right foot and creates space for himself inside the box, but he can't hit the target and fires his shot over the bar. He needed to test Leno from that position!
Willian and Cairney play a one-two with the Brazilian winger bursting into the box. He strikes it, looking to curl one into the far corner, but Branthwaite is there to head it away, and it deflects off an attacker and the Toffees win a goal-kick. It's excellent defending from the young centre-back.
The Toffees win a throw-in inside the Fulham half and Mykolenko is there to take. He finds Calvert-Lewin but the Everton forward gives it away. Fulham can now break with Robinson who attempts to cut it back towards the edge of the penalty area, but it cannons off Young and the Cottagers will now have a chance to fill the box from a corner.
Inches away from a Fulham goal! From the resulting corner, Silva's side play it short and it eventually falls to Pereira outside the box. He strikes it from range and it's a dipping effort, but it goes narrowly over the bar. Pickford certainly looked worried, but the Brazilian fails to hit the target.
What a chance! Robinson sends a delivery towards the back post which eventually falls to Castagne. Tarkowski somehow blocks it off the line but it falls straight to Jimenez from just outside the six-yard box, but he can't hit the target from just a few yards out! A massive opportunity for Fulham there.
Branthwaite goes into the book for a strong challenge on Jimenez in the middle of the pitch.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of one minute of added time at the end of the first half.
HALF-TIME: FULHAM 0-0 EVERTON
Fulham go into the break at 0-0 with Everton at Craven Cottage. Both sides have enjoyed a few chances a piece, but the away team might feel a little disappointed not to have opened the scoring. The Toffees had an effort cleared off the line while Robinson appeared to have handled the ball inside the box, but the referee was having none of it and VAR opted not to intervene. The Cottagers have had their fair share of opportunities also, with Jimenez coming closest for the home team. The game is wide open for either side to come out of the blocks at pace in the second half and break the deadlock.
Everton have managed seven shots so far to Fulham's five, creating 0.73 expected goals (xG). The home team have dominated the possession, however, managing to have the ball 70.4 per cent of the game. The two teams have produced a shot on target a piece, so Silva and Dyche will be desperate to see their respective sides test the opposition goalkeepers more often. Both the Cottagers and the Toffees have attacking options on the bench - could we see Beto, Vinicius, or Muniz early in the second half?
Silva makes a change at half-time, with Muniz coming on in place of Jimenez in attack for Fulham.
McNeil gets the second half under way for Everton at Craven Cottage!
The Everton fans are appealing for a penalty! Danjuma breaks down the left-hand side and fires a cross into the box. Harrison takes the ball on the turn and goes down under the challenge of Tosin, but the referee waves play on. It would have certainly been soft, and VAR have opted not to recommend a review for the on-field referee.
A dangerous delivery into the box from Castagne causes problems for the Toffees, but Godfrey does superbly to divert the ball behind for a corner with his head. Willian is there to take for Fulham and they go short. It eventually comes to Cairney who crosses into the box, but it's headed away again. De Cordova-Reid tries an effort from range, but Pickford can comfortably gather.
McNeil gets away with one! Everton look to play out from the back, but McNeil's sloppy pass is intercepted. It falls to Muniz who is through on goal, but his effort is saved by Pickford. The assistant referee has his flag, so it wouldn't have counted anyway and Everton have a free-kick.
Everton go long from a free-kick and Tarkowski rises highest at the back post. His header falls to Godfrey who strikes it from inside the penalty area, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Garner takes the set-piece and it finds Calvert-Lewin at the back post... but his header hits the bar! So close!
The Toffees are turning the screw! A Garner pass finds Young in space on the right-hand side, and he wastes no time delivering into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin is stretching and attempts to divert a header towards goal, but it loops over the bar and lands on the roof of the net. Everton are pushing to find an opener.
Robinson is in space on the left-hand side and he sends a whipped delivery towards the back post. Pereira flings himself at it, but he doesn't connect well with the shot and the ball trickles behind for a goal-kick to Everton. Robinson was in way too much room on the left, with the Toffees playing incredibly narrow.
Harrison finds the run of Calvert-Lewin in behind the Fulham defence and it looks like he's through on goal. He tries to cut it back to a team-mate and it falls to Mykolenko on the edge of the penalty area, but his shot is deflected away from danger. Eventually, the assistant referee raises his flag. Calvert-Lewin was offside originally.
Fulham are starting to grow into the game now and have had three corners in quick succession, looking to fill the box at every opportunity and cause problems for Everton. The Toffees conceded twice from set-pieces against Luton at the weekend, so it's an area they are vulnerable at the moment.
So close! Branthwaite commits to a tackle in the middle of the pitch and Muniz wins the ball off him. Pereira breaks and bursts into the Everton half, before returning the ball to Muniz. He looks to test Pickford from outside of the box, but it deflects off Mykolenko and out for a corner. From the resulting corner, Castagne powers a header towards goal, but it hits the bar with Pickford rooted to the spot! Almost the opener!
After a slow start to the second half, Fulham are starting to push for the opening goal. The Cottagers have managed 10 shots in the second half alone, with two on target. The Toffees need to tighten up if they are to hold on and keep a clean sheet today. Elsewhere, Luton are now 4-0 up at home to Brighton, meaning Everton remain in the relegation zone.
The Toffees now have a chance, but the assistant has his flag up once again. Everton look to counter-attack as Harrison tests the goalkeeper from just inside the penalty area, but it's palmed away by Leno before Tosin clears away from danger.
Fulham drive forward with Robinson down the left-hand side. He jinks past Young and looks to take on Godfrey, and the Everton defender diverts the ball behind for a corner. Willian will take once again and it's whipped towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin is there to meet it and he heads it away.
The Cottagers have another opportunity from a corner. De Cordova-Reid finds the overlapping run of Pereira and he fires towards goal, but it hits the side netting. The Fulham players appeal for a corner, and the referee agrees. Branthwaite made a superb stop to deny Silva's side.
Silva makes an alteration at the back. Diop appeared to be struggling, and Ream will replace him.
What a save! Willian creates space for himself on the right and floats a delivery towards the back post. Tosin rises above everyone inside the Everton penalty area and fires a header towards goal, but Pickford somehow gets his fingers to it and tips it over the bar! It's an unbelievable stop to keep the game at 0-0!
Everton have a worry now with Branthwaite down. The young centre-back looks in some discomfort and the referee has allowed the medical team to enter the pitch and give him treatment. After a short delay, it looks as though he will be able to continue. Branthwaite returns to the action.
Patterson comes on to replace Young on the right-hand side for Everton.
Dyche makes a like-for-like change in attack, with Beto entering the fray in place of Calvert-Lewin.
Inches away from an opener! Robinson, once again, bursts down the left-hand side in space, getting to the byline before drilling a cross along the floor towards the edge of the box. De Cordova-Reid swings a leg at it, and his shot whistles past the post with Pickford scrambling across his line.
Everton win a free-kick in a dangerous position, deep inside the Fulham half. Palhinha was adjudged to have fouled Beto, and the Toffees will now fill the box. Garner is standing over it and delivers towards the back post, and it's headed behind by Tosin and Dyche's side now have a corner.
Danjuma is now down after another strong challenge from Palhinha. The medical team are on the pitch giving treatment to the Everton forward. There is some activity on the Everton bench and it looks as through the Toffees will make a change.
Danjuma is unable to continue, and Dobbin is the player to replace him for Everton.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of six minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Another opportunity for Fulham. Willian finds the run of De Cordova-Reid in space beyond the Everton defence. He clips a cross into the penalty area and Muniz is there unmarked. He heads it towards goal, but it's straight at Pickford who saves. Either side of him, and the Cottagers would have taken the lead!
Beto does well to win a corner, swivelling on the edge of the Fulham area before unleashing from range, with his shot deflecting behind. Everton have filled the box and McNeil is going to whip it in. It's sent towards the back post and headed across goal by Tarkowski, but Beto heads it over from two yards out! He can't believe he's missed!
FULL-TIME: FULHAM 0-0 EVERTON
Fulham against Everton ends 0-0 with both sides somehow failing to find the back of the net. The two teams managed 46 shots between them, but Pickford and Leno pulled off some smart stops to make sure their respective sides kept a clean sheet. Beto managed to miss the target from a few yards out in the final moments of the game, with the goal at his mercy, but the Cottagers had their fair share of opportunities too. Jimenez and Muniz had chances on either side of half-time, but Silva and Dyche's men weren't clinical enough to open the scoring. Fulham will now travel to Burnley on the weekend in the Premier League, while Everton host Tottenham at Goodison Park. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Alejandro Garnacho’s double and a Rasmus Hojlund strike on his 21st birthday gave Manchester United a comfortable 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb above their opponents into sixth.
It is successive Premier League victories for United as they continue their unbeaten start to 2024.
How the match unfolded
Prior to kick-off, managers Erik ten Hag and David Moyes carried out wreaths to honour the victims of the Munich air disaster, which happened 66 years ago.
The first chance of the match fell to West Ham on 11 minutes, when Tomas Soucek’s deflected header from James Ward-Prowse's outswinging corner forced a fine save from Andre Onana.
At the other end, Bruno Fernandes’ dipping long-range strike was pushed away at full stretch by Alphonse Areola.
Man Utd took the lead on 23 minutes through Hojlund, who unleashed a brilliant low right-footed shot past Areola to score in his fourth consecutive Premier League appearance.
Hojlund is only the second player to find the back of the net on his 21st birthday in the competition, along with Noel Whelan in 1995.
West Ham made a change during the break with Lukasz Fabianski replacing Areola due to an apparent head injury.
The Hammers had a great chance to equalise on 48 minutes as Emerson dispossessed Harry Maguire and ran through on goal, but the Italian fired his shot over the crossbar.
Less than a minute later, Man Utd doubled their lead when Garnacho cut inside before his left-footed attempt went in via a deflection off Nayef Aguerd. Garnacho celebrated by sitting on the advertising hoardings, a celebration used often this season by West Ham's Mohammed Kudus.
West Ham did have a chance to reduce the deficit and Jarrod Bowen should have made more of a 1v1 situation, but his attempt was thwarted by Diogo Dalot, who slid in to produce a brilliant last-ditch tackle.
United were dealt a blow on 70 minutes when Lisandro Martinez was forced off with a suspected knee injury.
Garnacho scored his second of the match with six minutes remaining. Scott McTominay took the ball off West Ham substitute Kalvin Phillips and surged forward before playing in the Argentinian to slot home.
McTominay could have added a fourth, but dragged his shot wide in stoppage time.
United move above West Ham and have 38 points, eight behind fourth-placed Aston Villa.
The Hammers are two points below in seventh.

Team_19	"[""Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_10 and Team_9 at Craven Cottage.\nTeam_10 will be hoping to continue their impressive home form of late, having won four of their last five Premier League games on their own turf. The Cottagers could climb into 12th place in the Premier League table with a win today, and they will likely be relying on Raul Jimenez to provide the goods in attack. The Mexican forward has scored more Premier League goals against Team_9 than he has against any other club (five). Team_10 have failed to win in their last four fixtures, but three of those have come in cup competitions.\nTeam_9 travel to the capital to face Marco Silva’s Team_10. London has been kind to the Toffees so far this season having won three out of their four fixtures in the city (1L). Sean Dyche’s side are still fighting above the relegation zone despite their 10-point deduction earlier in the campaign, and a victory could see them go four points clear of the drop if results go their way. Only Team_11 and Team_13, who are first and second in the Premier League respectively, have won more games on the road than Team_9 this season (five). The Merseyside outfit will be hoping to bounce back after being knocked out of the FA Cup by Team_12 at the weekend.\nTeam_10 (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Antonee Robinson, Issa Diop, Tosin Adarabioyo, Timothy Castagne; Tom Cairney, Joao Palhinha; Willian, Andreas Pereira, Bobby De Cordova-Reid; Raul Jimenez.\nTeam_10 SUBS: Marek Rodak, Kenny Tete, Harrison Reed, Tim Ream, Rodrigo Muniz, Sasa Lukic, Carlos Vinicius, Tyrese Francois, Kristian Sekularac.\nTeam_9 (4-4-1-1): Jordan Pickford; Vitalii Mykolenko, Jarrad Branthwaite, James Tarkowski, Ben Godfrey; Arnaut Danjuma, Dwight McNeil, James Garner, Ashley Young; Jack Harrison; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nTeam_9 SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Joao Virginia, Beto, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Mackenzie Hunt, Lewis Dobbin, Jenson Metcalfe.\nSilva has made two changes from Team_10’s last Premier League fixture against Team_7 earlier in the month. At right-back, Tete has dropped to the bench, with Castagne coming into the starting XI. Further forward, De Cordova-Reid replaces Harry Wilson, who fails to make the squad.\nMeanwhile, Dyche has made three alterations from Team_9’s previous Premier League game against Team_2. Club captain Seamus Coleman misses out, so Young will return from injury to slot in on the right-hand side. Abdoulaye Doucoure and Amadou Onana are also unavailable, with Godfrey and McNeil coming into the starting XI.\nThe players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.\nJimenez gets the game under way for Team_10 at Craven Cottage!\nWhat a chance! Godfrey receives his throw-in back from Young and hooks the ball into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin does well to hold off the defender and lays it into the path of Harrison just inside the box. The Team_9 winger strikes it, but he can't quite curl it into the far corner. He should be hitting the target from there!\nIt's been end-to-end stuff so far with both sides attempting two shots and taking a corner each. Team_10 are clearly still trying to work out Team_9, considering Dyche's side have one natural central midfielder on the pitch. McNeil is lining up in an unfamiliar central role, with Godfrey at right-back and Young just ahead of him on the right-hand side of midfield.\nA switch of play hopes to find Robinson but Godfrey has come across to fire the ball out for a throw-in. Team_10 take quickly and the ball eventually finds Castagne who delivers into the area. It's headed away by Godfrey but only as far as Robinson who strikes from outside the area, but Pickford is there to palm it behind for a corner.\nPereira has gone down clutching his face after barging into Tarkowski. The referee has stopped the game just in case he needs treatment, but he's quickly back on his feet. Elsewhere, Luton have scored twice in quick succession and are currently leading Team_5 2-0, plunging Team_9 into the relegation zone.\nTeam_10 manage to break down the left-hand side after a deflected pass finds Jimenez. The Mexican forward drives into the box and looks to attempt an ambitious outside-of-the-boot cross towards the back post, but it evades all of his team-mates and goes off the side of the pitch for a throw-in to Team_9.\nMcNeil wins the ball back for Team_9 in a dangerous area, but his pass goes straight to the feet of Robinson, whose clearance cannons off Young and Team_10 win a throw-in. It was a real chance for the Toffees to create something, but they need to have more conviction in the final third of the pitch.\nTeam_9 win the ball back once again and it finds Danjuma who drives towards the penalty area. The Dutch forward has plenty of options to his left and right but attempts a highly ambitious effort from range, and it trickles into the arms of Leno. It's a shot on target, but the Team_10 goalkeeper was hardly threatened.\nTeam_10 are enjoying plenty of possession so far and have had 72.2 per cent of the ball. However, they've managed just two touches in the opposition box to Team_9 seven, with the away side looking like more of a threat in the final third since the game got under way. Neither team have truly threatened the opposition's goal yet, though.\nSo close! Danjuma is adjudged to have handled the ball and Team_10 win a free-kick. Pereira delivers into the penalty and Palhinha is there to meet it as he towers above Tarkowski, but he heads it over the bar. He will be disappointed not to have hit the target and tested Pickford between the sticks.\nHow has that not gone in?! From the resulting free-kick, Young whipped it into the penalty area and Leno was there to palm it away. Tarkowski strikes it back towards goal and it deflects onto the bar, before it's poked off the line by Robinson. It was inches away from going over the line, but the Toffees somehow fail to open the scoring!\nPalhinha goes into the book for a late challenge on Harrison just outside the Team_10 penalty area.\nDanjuma, Harrison, and Young are standing over the free-kick in a dangerous position for Team_9. Harrison is the one to take, but he drills the ball into the wall and the Team_10 supporters breathe a sigh or relief. Godfrey then fouls his opponent and the Cottagers can regroup with a free-kick inside their own penalty area.\nTeam_10 look to break with Willian on the left-hand side, but Godfrey pulls him back and the referee awards a yellow.\nSo close again for Team_9! The Toffees hit Team_10 on the counter-attack and a deflected pass from McNeil finds Danjuma. He cuts inside onto his right foot and creates space for himself inside the box, but he can't hit the target and fires his shot over the bar. He needed to test Leno from that position!\nWillian and Cairney play a one-two with the Brazilian winger bursting into the box. He strikes it, looking to curl one into the far corner, but Branthwaite is there to head it away, and it deflects off an attacker and the Toffees win a goal-kick. It's excellent defending from the young centre-back.\nThe Toffees win a throw-in inside the Team_10 half and Mykolenko is there to take. He finds Calvert-Lewin but the Team_9 forward gives it away. Team_10 can now break with Robinson who attempts to cut it back towards the edge of the penalty area, but it cannons off Young and the Cottagers will now have a chance to fill the box from a corner.\nInches away from a Team_10 goal! From the resulting corner, Silva's side play it short and it eventually falls to Pereira outside the box. He strikes it from range and it's a dipping effort, but it goes narrowly over the bar. Pickford certainly looked worried, but the Brazilian fails to hit the target.\nWhat a chance! Robinson sends a delivery towards the back post which eventually falls to Castagne. Tarkowski somehow blocks it off the line but it falls straight to Jimenez from just outside the six-yard box, but he can't hit the target from just a few yards out! A massive opportunity for Team_10 there.\nBranthwaite goes into the book for a strong challenge on Jimenez in the middle of the pitch.\nThe fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of one minute of added time at the end of the first half.\nHALF-TIME: Team_10 0-0 Team_9\nTeam_10 go into the break at 0-0 with Team_9 at Craven Cottage. Both sides have enjoyed a few chances a piece, but the away team might feel a little disappointed not to have opened the scoring. The Toffees had an effort cleared off the line while Robinson appeared to have handled the ball inside the box, but the referee was having none of it and VAR opted not to intervene. The Cottagers have had their fair share of opportunities also, with Jimenez coming closest for the home team. The game is wide open for either side to come out of the blocks at pace in the second half and break the deadlock.\nTeam_9 have managed seven shots so far to Team_10 five, creating 0.73 expected goals (xG). The home team have dominated the possession, however, managing to have the ball 70.4 per cent of the game. The two teams have produced a shot on target a piece, so Silva and Dyche will be desperate to see their respective sides test the opposition goalkeepers more often. Both the Cottagers and the Toffees have attacking options on the bench - could we see Beto, Vinicius, or Muniz early in the second half?\nSilva makes a change at half-time, with Muniz coming on in place of Jimenez in attack for Team_10.\nMcNeil gets the second half under way for Team_9 at Craven Cottage!\nThe Team_9 fans are appealing for a penalty! Danjuma breaks down the left-hand side and fires a cross into the box. Harrison takes the ball on the turn and goes down under the challenge of Tosin, but the referee waves play on. It would have certainly been soft, and VAR have opted not to recommend a review for the on-field referee.\nA dangerous delivery into the box from Castagne causes problems for the Toffees, but Godfrey does superbly to divert the ball behind for a corner with his head. Willian is there to take for Team_10 and they go short. It eventually comes to Cairney who crosses into the box, but it's headed away again. De Cordova-Reid tries an effort from range, but Pickford can comfortably gather.\nMcNeil gets away with one! Team_9 look to play out from the back, but McNeil's sloppy pass is intercepted. It falls to Muniz who is through on goal, but his effort is saved by Pickford. The assistant referee has his flag, so it wouldn't have counted anyway and Team_9 have a free-kick.\nTeam_9 go long from a free-kick and Tarkowski rises highest at the back post. His header falls to Godfrey who strikes it from inside the penalty area, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Garner takes the set-piece and it finds Calvert-Lewin at the back post... but his header hits the bar! So close!\nThe Toffees are turning the screw! A Garner pass finds Young in space on the right-hand side, and he wastes no time delivering into the penalty area. Calvert-Lewin is stretching and attempts to divert a header towards goal, but it loops over the bar and lands on the roof of the net. Team_9 are pushing to find an opener.\nRobinson is in space on the left-hand side and he sends a whipped delivery towards the back post. Pereira flings himself at it, but he doesn't connect well with the shot and the ball trickles behind for a goal-kick to Team_9. Robinson was in way too much room on the left, with the Toffees playing incredibly narrow.\nHarrison finds the run of Calvert-Lewin in behind the Team_10 defence and it looks like he's through on goal. He tries to cut it back to a team-mate and it falls to Mykolenko on the edge of the penalty area, but his shot is deflected away from danger. Eventually, the assistant referee raises his flag. Calvert-Lewin was offside originally.\nTeam_10 are starting to grow into the game now and have had three corners in quick succession, looking to fill the box at every opportunity and cause problems for Team_9. The Toffees conceded twice from set-pieces against Luton at the weekend, so it's an area they are vulnerable at the moment.\nSo close! Branthwaite commits to a tackle in the middle of the pitch and Muniz wins the ball off him. Pereira breaks and bursts into the Team_9 half, before returning the ball to Muniz. He looks to test Pickford from outside of the box, but it deflects off Mykolenko and out for a corner. From the resulting corner, Castagne powers a header towards goal, but it hits the bar with Pickford rooted to the spot! Almost the opener!\nAfter a slow start to the second half, Team_10 are starting to push for the opening goal. The Cottagers have managed 10 shots in the second half alone, with two on target. The Toffees need to tighten up if they are to hold on and keep a clean sheet today. Elsewhere, Luton are now 4-0 up at home to Team_5, meaning Team_9 remain in the relegation zone.\nThe Toffees now have a chance, but the assistant has his flag up once again. Team_9 look to counter-attack as Harrison tests the goalkeeper from just inside the penalty area, but it's palmed away by Leno before Tosin clears away from danger.\nTeam_10 drive forward with Robinson down the left-hand side. He jinks past Young and looks to take on Godfrey, and the Team_9 defender diverts the ball behind for a corner. Willian will take once again and it's whipped towards the front post, but Calvert-Lewin is there to meet it and he heads it away.\nThe Cottagers have another opportunity from a corner. De Cordova-Reid finds the overlapping run of Pereira and he fires towards goal, but it hits the side netting. The Team_10 players appeal for a corner, and the referee agrees.

93449	Sheffield Utd	Bournemouth	2023-11-25	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	30208.0	Andy Madley	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between Burnley and Crystal Palace at Turf Moor.
Vincent Kompany's Burnley have endured a difficult start on their return to the Premier League. Currently occupying 19th place, the Clarets have lost each of their five home matches this term and are on a four-game losing streak across all competitions. However, victory here could lift them out of the relegation zone.
As for 13th-placed Palace, they could move into the top half with a win here. Roy Hodgson's side endured a winless October, picking up just one point from their three matches and suffering back-to-back defeats. But they have collected seven points from their last four top-flight visits to Turf Moor.
BURNLEY (4-3-3): James Trafford; Vitinho, Jordan Beyer, Dara O'Shea, Charlie Taylor; Johann Gudmundsson, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill; Luca Koleosho, Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Jay Rodriguez.
SUBS: Arijanet Muric, Connor Roberts, Hannes Delcroix, Han-Noah Massengo, Nathan Redmond, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Wilson Odobert, Mike Tresor, Anass Zaroury.
CRYSTAL PALACE (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Cheick Oumar Doucoure, Jefferson Lerma; Jordan Ayew, Will Hughes, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.
SUBS: Remi Matthews, Nathaniel Clyne, Rob Holding, Chris Richards, Naouirou Ahamada, Eberechi Eze, Jairo Riedewald, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Matheus Franca.
Kompany makes three changes from last weekend's defeat at Bournemouth. Beyer has shaken off a knee problem to start in defence, while Brownhill and Rodriguez also come into the XI. Josh Cullen serves a one-match suspension, while Lyle Foster misses out again through illness. Roberts returns from a ban on the bench.
As for Palace, Hodgson names an unchanged starting XI from last weekend's loss to Tottenham. Johnstone and Ayew start after signing new contracts earlier this week, while Mitchell has shaken off a knock to keep his place at left-back. Eze returns on the bench after a hamstring injury, but the game is too soon for Michael Olise.
The teams are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is fast approaching at Turf Moor.
Referee Peter Bankes blows his whistle and the match is under way!
Just wide! Burnley make a purposeful start and Gudmundsson's cross is met by Amdouni, who directs his header narrowly wide of the left post.
Palace are living dangerously early on as they try to play out from a goal-kick. However, Burnley are quick to press their opponents and it takes an important Andersen intervention to prevent the hosts from scoring.
Burnley are aiming to avoid becoming the first side in English top-flight history to lose each of their opening six home games in a season. But the Clarets certainly mean business so far.
The hosts have enjoyed over 60 per cent of possession so far and threaten down the left with Koleosho looking for a team-mate in the box. However, Doucoure anticipates the danger well and intercepts the ball.
Palace arrived at Turf Moor of the back of two straight defeats; as many as in their previous 11 Premier League matches. The Eagles will be desperately seeking a response today.
Burnley threaten again as Gudmundsson sends a deep cross towards the far post. Amdouni looks to latch onto the ball, but Ward tracks the flight well to nod behind for a corner.
The hosts send a long ball over the top of the Palace defence. But there is just too much pace as it evades Koleosho down the left flank.
Chasing down Trafford, Edouard catches the Burnley goalkeeper with a late sliding challenge and can have no complaints as he receives the first yellow card of the game.
VAR did have an additional look at Edouard's challenge on Trafford. However, they eventually decide it was worthy of just a yellow card and nothing more. The Palace striker can count himself fortunate.
Burnley have conceded the most first-half goals in Premier League games this season with 11. However, Palace have scored the fewest in the opening 45 minutes of matches with just one.
SCHLUPP!!! 1-0 PALACE! It's a horrible moment for Beyer! The Burnley defender appears to be in control as he looks to tidy up a long ball down the right flank. But he is outmuscled by Ayew, who then drives into the penalty area before squaring the ball across the six-yard box for the onrushing Schlupp to apply the finishing touch.
Ayew did brilliantly to get the better of Beyer and then showed great awareness to pick out Schlupp, who demonstrated wonderful anticipation and desire to connect with the cross.
Against the run of play, Palace take the lead at Turf Moor. Burnley had been on top for most of the opening 22 minutes but, in the blink of an eye, they find themselves trailing.
Burnley try to respond and Vitinho sends an inviting ball into the box. But none of his team-mates are on his wavelength and it drifts aimlessly behind for a goal-kick.
Of course, there is a long way to go in this contest. But as things stand, Kompany would become the second manager after Mick McCarthy to lose each of his first six away Premier League games.
JUST WIDE! Burnley threaten with Koleosho leading the charge. Although Palace deal with the initial threat, the hosts continue to push. Taylor whips in a cross that is met by Gudmundsson, but his header goes just the wrong side of the right post.
Those were positive signs for Burnley to build on. They made a strong start to the game, only for a defensive mistake to result in them falling behind. But there is still plenty of time for them to turn things around.
Palace look to build down the left flank as they seek a second goal. But their momentum stalls when Schlupp is penalised for bundling Vitinho over.
There are 10 minutes of the first half remaining at Turf Moor. Palace still lead by a goal to nil, but Burnley have responded well to conceding. Can they respond before the break?
Koleosho looks to make things happen again down the left flank. He tries to send the ball into the box, but Ward is well-placed to deflect it behind for a corner.
WHAT A TACKLE! Taylor picks out Koleosho with a lovely lofted ball to the left wing. The latter takes it in his stride and advances into the penalty area, but Andersen produces a perfectly timed sliding challenge to deny him a shot on goal.
Burnley continue to ask questions as Brownhill sends a ball in from the left flank. The ball comes back to the midfielder, but he is ruled offside.
Gudmundsson whips a free-kick into the box from the right. Amdouni meets the delivery, but his header is lacking the required pace and direction and drifts behind for a goal-kick.
Palace go in search of the second goal with Ayew and Schlupp sending balls into the box, but Burnley survive as the fourth official indicates there will be an additional two minutes at the end of this first half.
Good try! Burnley look to equalise before the break and take a quick free-kick on the edge of the penalty area. Koleosho lets fly and Johnstone is forced to push his effort to safety.
Guehi goes into the book for dissent after taking his protests with the referee too far. The England defender was far from happy with the official, but needs to calm down.
Ayew also goes into the book for Palace. Like Guehi, he appeared to be questioning the referee's decision to allow Burnley to take the quick free-kick just now.
HALF-TIME: BURNLEY 0-1 CRYSTAL PALACE
Palace are in front at the halfway mark at Turf Moor. Burnley dominated the opening 20 minutes, but were caught out soon after as a defensive lapse culminated in Ayew squaring the ball for Schlupp to apply the finishing touch at the far post. The hosts have responded well, but trail at the break.
Despite their positive display, Kompany will be urging his Burnley players to demonstrate a stronger clinical edge. Despite registering eight shots, just one was on target during the opening 45 minutes. They must address that upon the resumption of this contest.
The referee blows his whistle and Palace get the ball rolling again in the second half.
Palace are without a win in each of their last five league meetings with Burnley. But as things stand, the Eagles are on course to end that streak today.
Burnley look to launch an early threat in the second half as Rodriguez flicks on a long ball towards Koleosho, but Andersen gets across well to make a neatly timed sliding intervention.
Palace continue to maintain their defensive discipline. Gudmundsson looks to switch the play towards Koleosho, but Ward is alert and intercepts for the visitors.
A patient build-up from Burnley culminates in O'Shea crossing from the right flank. Rodriguez meets it on the turn, but cannot direct his header towards the target.
As things stand, Palace will climb into the top half of the Premier League table with victory here. But they must maintain their concentration levels and discipline throughout the remainder of this contest.
Palace make their first change as Eze returns to action after missing the Eagles' last three matches. He replaces Doucoure, who gained possession three times for the visitors - a tally only bettered by Ayew and Andersen.
CHANCE! Burnley threaten with Koleosho leading their charge from the left once more. He cuts the ball back for Gudmundsson, who looks to help it towards goal, but it drifts just wide of the right post.
There is a concern for the hosts with Berge moving a little gingerly. The midfielder and his team-mates will be hoping he can shake it off.
OFFSIDE, NO GOAL! Burnley have the ball in the net as Koleosho cuts inside and lets fly. His tame effort is latched onto by Rodriguez, who clinically sweeps the ball into the roof of the net. However, his joy is cut short by the offside flag and it was definitely the right call by the linesman.
Burnley have scored just eight goals in the Premier League this season, with only bottom side Sheffield United netting fewer times (seven). The Clarets must address that if they are going to take anything from this game.
We are into the final quarter of the game at Turf Moor. Palace are still leading by a goal to nil and looking fairly comfortable at the moment.
Schlupp, whose goal separates the two sides, is given a breather by Hodgson after he was involved in a joint-high nine duels for the visitors today. He is replaced by Ahamada.
Ward, who made a game-high four tackles today, also makes way with Clyne coming on in his place.
It will be interesting to see whether Burnley follow suit and turn to the bench. The hosts are looking for inspiration in their quest to turn this deficit around.
Palace are looking comfortable as we approach the final quarter of an hour at Turf Moor. The visitors are neatly knocking the ball around and maintaining possession.
Gudmundsson whips a long ball forward that Amdouni and Rodriguez help towards Keleosho on the left. The winger tries his luck from a tight angle, but his effort is always rising.
Burnley make a double-substitution. The first sees Amdouni, who had two shots on goal, replaced by Redmond.
The lively Koleosho, who had a game-high four shots on goal and was involved in 13 duels, is given a breather by the hosts. Odobert takes his place.
Worth a go! After Burnley attack down the left flank, Brownhill has time and space to let fly from 25 yards. His fierce effort is on target and Johnstone is forced to turn it over.
GOOD SAVE! Rodriguez loses his marker to meet Gudmunsson's corner at the near post. He heads the ball towards well, but Johnstone produces a smart reflex save to keep it out.
The hosts continue to threaten and Odobert embarks on a strong run down the left before drilling the ball towards goal. It is threatening to sneak in at the far post and Johnstone is forced to push it away.
There is a concern for Palace as Edouard stays down and is in need of attention. The visitors will hope he is fine to continue, but will surely ready a substitute for if not.
Edouard, who has been involved in a game-high eight aerial duels, is unable to continue and is replaced by Richards in a defensive change by Palace.
After successfully completing a game-high 80 passes for Burnley, Beyer makes way for the final few minutes. Tresor comes on in his place.
CHANCE! Burnley seek the equaliser and O'Shea meets a cross into the box from the right wing. His downward header is creeping into the bottom corner, but Johnstone gets down well to keep it out.
Lerma brings down Brownhill as we approach stoppage time at Turf Moor. The Palace midfielder goes into the book.
We are into the first of five additional minutes of stoppage time at the end of this game. Can Palace hold on or can Burnley snatch a dramatic equaliser?
Gudmunds­son has enjoyed a productive day, completing a game-high 94.1 per cent of his passes for Burnley. He is replaced by Bruun Larsen.
Andersen has his name taken by the referee. Burnley have a free-kick and time is rapidly running out for the hosts.
MITCHELL!!! 2-0 PALACE! GAME OVER! The visitors secure all three points in the dying moments. Burnley try to clear the ball down the other end of the field, but get it all wrong. The ball ends up with Eze on the edge of the box. The substitute then produces a perfectly timed lay-off for the onrushing Mitchell, who slots past Trafford to make it 2-0.
Eze showed great composure on the edge of the box as he waited before laying the ball off for Mitchell to put the game beyond Burnley.
FULL-TIME: BURNLEY 0-2 CRYSTAL PALACE
Crystal Palace move into the top half of the Premier League table after a 2-0 victory at Burnley. Although on the back foot for most of the first 22 minutes, the Eagles took the lead against the run of play through Jeffrey Schlupp. Roy Hodgson's side then wrapped up the points in stoppage time when Eberechi Eze set up Tyrick Mitchell to put the game beyond the hosts. Burnley become the first side in English top-flight history to lose each of their opening six home games in a season. The Clarets will desperately seek a response away at Arsenal next Saturday, with Palace hosting Everton on the same day. That's all for today. Thank you for joining us. Until next time, goodbye!"	"Marcus Tavernier and Justin Kluivert’s first Premier League goals of the season earned AFC Bournemouth a 3-1 win against Sheffield United, their first away victory of the campaign.
Tavernier produced a brace either side of Kluivert's goal before Oli McBurnie scored a consolation goal in the seventh minute of second-half stoppage time. 
How the match unfolded
Bournemouth went in front in the 12th minute through Tavernier, who was slipped in by Antoine Semenyo before slotting past Wes Foderingham. 
In the third minute of first-half stoppage time Bournemouth doubled their lead after a terrible mistake by Foderingham. The Sheff Utd goalkeeper rushed out of his net, but was dispossessed by Kluivert, who placed his shot into an empty net. 
It was the Dutchman’s first goal in the Premier League, making him only the second player to score in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and Bundesliga, after Stevan Jovetic. 
Bournemouth's third came when Adam Smith’s cross to the back post was finished off by Tavernier. The midfielder ghosted past Oliver Norwood and produced a fine side-footed finish for his second of the match in the 51st minute.
Bournemouth nearly had a fourth when Semenyo drove with the ball into the Sheff Utd box and unleashed a low driven shot that fell into the path of Dominic Solanke, who missed from close range. 
Sheff Utd tried to mount a comeback but were unsuccessful as a header from substitute McBurnie and a shot from William Osula were comfortably saved by Neto.
However, the Blades were able to grab a late consolation goal from McBurnie's back-post header.
Bournemouth, who have now won three of their last four matches, are 16th and seven points clear of 18th-placed Sheff Utd.

Team_3	"[""Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_6 and Team_8 at Turf Moor.\nVincent Kompany's Team_6 have endured a difficult start on their return to the Premier League. Currently occupying 19th place, the Clarets have lost each of their five home matches this term and are on a four-game losing streak across all competitions. However, victory here could lift them out of the relegation zone.\nAs for 13th-placed Palace, they could move into the top half with a win here. Roy Hodgson's side endured a winless October, picking up just one point from their three matches and suffering back-to-back defeats. But they have collected seven points from their last four top-flight visits to Turf Moor.\nTeam_6 (4-3-3): James Trafford; Vitinho, Jordan Beyer, Dara O'Shea, Charlie Taylor; Johann Gudmundsson, Sander Berge, Josh Brownhill; Luca Koleosho, Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Jay Rodriguez.\nSUBS: Arijanet Muric, Connor Roberts, Hannes Delcroix, Han-Noah Massengo, Nathan Redmond, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Wilson Odobert, Mike Tresor, Anass Zaroury.\nTeam_8 (4-2-3-1): Sam Johnstone; Joel Ward, Joachim Andersen, Marc Guehi, Tyrick Mitchell; Cheick Oumar Doucoure, Jefferson Lerma; Jordan Ayew, Will Hughes, Jeffrey Schlupp; Odsonne Edouard.\nSUBS: Remi Matthews, Nathaniel Clyne, Rob Holding, Chris Richards, Naouirou Ahamada, Eberechi Eze, Jairo Riedewald, Jean-Philippe Mateta, Matheus Franca.\nKompany makes three changes from last weekend's defeat at Team_3. Beyer has shaken off a knee problem to start in defence, while Brownhill and Rodriguez also come into the XI. Josh Cullen serves a one-match suspension, while Lyle Foster misses out again through illness. Roberts returns from a ban on the bench.\nAs for Palace, Hodgson names an unchanged starting XI from last weekend's loss to Team_18. Johnstone and Ayew start after signing new contracts earlier this week, while Mitchell has shaken off a knock to keep his place at left-back. Eze returns on the bench after a hamstring injury, but the game is too soon for Michael Olise.\nThe teams are making their way out onto the field and kick-off is fast approaching at Turf Moor.\nReferee Peter Bankes blows his whistle and the match is under way!\nJust wide! Team_6 make a purposeful start and Gudmundsson's cross is met by Amdouni, who directs his header narrowly wide of the left post.\nPalace are living dangerously early on as they try to play out from a goal-kick. However, Team_6 are quick to press their opponents and it takes an important Andersen intervention to prevent the hosts from scoring.\nTeam_6 are aiming to avoid becoming the first side in English top-flight history to lose each of their opening six home games in a season. But the Clarets certainly mean business so far.\nThe hosts have enjoyed over 60 per cent of possession so far and threaten down the left with Koleosho looking for a team-mate in the box. However, Doucoure anticipates the danger well and intercepts the ball.\nPalace arrived at Turf Moor of the back of two straight defeats; as many as in their previous 11 Premier League matches. The Eagles will be desperately seeking a response today.\nTeam_6 threaten again as Gudmundsson sends a deep cross towards the far post. Amdouni looks to latch onto the ball, but Ward tracks the flight well to nod behind for a corner.\nThe hosts send a long ball over the top of the Palace defence. But there is just too much pace as it evades Koleosho down the left flank.\nChasing down Trafford, Edouard catches the Team_6 goalkeeper with a late sliding challenge and can have no complaints as he receives the first yellow card of the game.\nVAR did have an additional look at Edouard's challenge on Trafford. However, they eventually decide it was worthy of just a yellow card and nothing more. The Palace striker can count himself fortunate.\nTeam_6 have conceded the most first-half goals in Premier League games this season with 11. However, Palace have scored the fewest in the opening 45 minutes of matches with just one.\nSCHLUPP!!! 1-0 PALACE! It's a horrible moment for Beyer! The Team_6 defender appears to be in control as he looks to tidy up a long ball down the right flank. But he is outmuscled by Ayew, who then drives into the penalty area before squaring the ball across the six-yard box for the onrushing Schlupp to apply the finishing touch.\nAyew did brilliantly to get the better of Beyer and then showed great awareness to pick out Schlupp, who demonstrated wonderful anticipation and desire to connect with the cross.\nAgainst the run of play, Palace take the lead at Turf Moor. Team_6 had been on top for most of the opening 22 minutes but, in the blink of an eye, they find themselves trailing.\nTeam_6 try to respond and Vitinho sends an inviting ball into the box. But none of his team-mates are on his wavelength and it drifts aimlessly behind for a goal-kick.\nOf course, there is a long way to go in this contest. But as things stand, Kompany would become the second manager after Mick McCarthy to lose each of his first six away Premier League games.\nJUST WIDE! Team_6 threaten with Koleosho leading the charge. Although Palace deal with the initial threat, the hosts continue to push. Taylor whips in a cross that is met by Gudmundsson, but his header goes just the wrong side of the right post.\nThose were positive signs for Team_6 to build on. They made a strong start to the game, only for a defensive mistake to result in them falling behind. But there is still plenty of time for them to turn things around.\nPalace look to build down the left flank as they seek a second goal. But their momentum stalls when Schlupp is penalised for bundling Vitinho over.\nThere are 10 minutes of the first half remaining at Turf Moor. Palace still lead by a goal to nil, but Team_6 have responded well to conceding. Can they respond before the break?\nKoleosho looks to make things happen again down the left flank. He tries to send the ball into the box, but Ward is well-placed to deflect it behind for a corner.\nWHAT A TACKLE! Taylor picks out Koleosho with a lovely lofted ball to the left wing. The latter takes it in his stride and advances into the penalty area, but Andersen produces a perfectly timed sliding challenge to deny him a shot on goal.\nTeam_6 continue to ask questions as Brownhill sends a ball in from the left flank. The ball comes back to the midfielder, but he is ruled offside.\nGudmundsson whips a free-kick into the box from the right. Amdouni meets the delivery, but his header is lacking the required pace and direction and drifts behind for a goal-kick.\nPalace go in search of the second goal with Ayew and Schlupp sending balls into the box, but Team_6 survive as the fourth official indicates there will be an additional two minutes at the end of this first half.\nGood try! Team_6 look to equalise before the break and take a quick free-kick on the edge of the penalty area. Koleosho lets fly and Johnstone is forced to push his effort to safety.\nGuehi goes into the book for dissent after taking his protests with the referee too far. The England defender was far from happy with the official, but needs to calm down.\nAyew also goes into the book for Palace. Like Guehi, he appeared to be questioning the referee's decision to allow Team_6 to take the quick free-kick just now.\nHALF-TIME: Team_6 0-1 Team_8\nPalace are in front at the halfway mark at Turf Moor. Team_6 dominated the opening 20 minutes, but were caught out soon after as a defensive lapse culminated in Ayew squaring the ball for Schlupp to apply the finishing touch at the far post. The hosts have responded well, but trail at the break.\nDespite their positive display, Kompany will be urging his Team_6 players to demonstrate a stronger clinical edge. Despite registering eight shots, just one was on target during the opening 45 minutes. They must address that upon the resumption of this contest.\nThe referee blows his whistle and Palace get the ball rolling again in the second half.\nPalace are without a win in each of their last five league meetings with Team_6. But as things stand, the Eagles are on course to end that streak today.\nTeam_6 look to launch an early threat in the second half as Rodriguez flicks on a long ball towards Koleosho, but Andersen gets across well to make a neatly timed sliding intervention.\nPalace continue to maintain their defensive discipline. Gudmundsson looks to switch the play towards Koleosho, but Ward is alert and intercepts for the visitors.\nA patient build-up from Team_6 culminates in O'Shea crossing from the right flank. Rodriguez meets it on the turn, but cannot direct his header towards the target.\nAs things stand, Palace will climb into the top half of the Premier League table with victory here. But they must maintain their concentration levels and discipline throughout the remainder of this contest.\nPalace make their first change as Eze returns to action after missing the Eagles' last three matches. He replaces Doucoure, who gained possession three times for the visitors - a tally only bettered by Ayew and Andersen.\nCHANCE! Team_6 threaten with Koleosho leading their charge from the left once more. He cuts the ball back for Gudmundsson, who looks to help it towards goal, but it drifts just wide of the right post.\nThere is a concern for the hosts with Berge moving a little gingerly. The midfielder and his team-mates will be hoping he can shake it off.\nOFFSIDE, NO GOAL! Team_6 have the ball in the net as Koleosho cuts inside and lets fly. His tame effort is latched onto by Rodriguez, who clinically sweeps the ball into the roof of the net. However, his joy is cut short by the offside flag and it was definitely the right call by the linesman.\nTeam_6 have scored just eight goals in the Premier League this season, with only bottom side Team_17 netting fewer times (seven).

93609	West Ham	Aston Villa	2024-03-17	London Stadium, London	62461.0	Jarred Gillett	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Crystal Palace and Luton Town at Selhurst Park.
The Eagles will be playing their third game under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, who has overseen a 3-0 victory over Burnley and a 3-1 loss away at Tottenham so far. Palace have won three of their last four Premier League games at Selhurst Park (L1), as many as in their previous 13 beforehand (D5 L5). The Eagles have scored exactly three goals in each of those three wins, after having only scored three or more goals in three of their previous 31 home league matches prior to this. Crystal Palace are in 14th place on 28 points, having scored 32 goals and conceded 47. A victory could see them climb above Bournemouth into 13th position if results go their way.
Luton travel to Selhurst Park hoping to do the double over the capital club, having won the previous meeting 2-1 at Kenilworth Road, with Teden Mengi and Jacob Brown scoring their goals. However, Rob Edwards’ side are on a disappointing run of form, losing each of their last four games in the Premier League. The Hatters suffered a 3-2 defeat against Aston Villa at Kenilworth Road in their last Premier League match, extending their winless streak to five (D1 L4), putting them in 18th place on 20 points, four points from safety with 12 matches to play.
CRYSTAL PALACE (3-4-2-1): Sam Johnstone; Chris Richards, Joachim Andersen, Joel Ward; Tyrick Mitchell, Adam Wharton, Jefferson Lerma, Daniel Munoz; Eberechi Eze, Jordan Ayew; Jean-Philippe Mateta.
CRYSTAL PALACE SUBS: James Tomkins, Nathaniel Clyne, Will Hughes, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Dean Henderson, Luke Plange, Kaden Rodney, David Ozoh.
LUTON TOWN (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Teden Mengi, Gabriel Osho, Reece Burke; Alfie Doughty, Ross Barkley, Jordan Clark, Issa Kabore; Tahith Chong, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris.
LUTON TOWN SUBS: James Shea, Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Tim Krul, Daiki Hashioka, Andros Townsend, Zack Nelson, Axel Piesold.
Glasner has named an unchanged side from Palace’s 3-1 defeat away to Tottenham in the Premier League last time out. The Austrian manager is still working out his best team after a few weeks in charge, and he’s given the previous starting XI another chance to impress.
Meanwhile, Edwards has made two alterations from Luton’s 3-2 defeat at home to Aston Villa in their previous game. In defence, Amari'i Bell misses out due to injury, and Osho comes into the starting XI. Ogbene will also come into the side, with Townsend dropping to the bench.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Morris gets the game under way for Luton at Selhurst Park!
Clark looks to find Kabore down the right-hand side and he battles with Mitchell, winning a throw-in deep inside the Palace half. Play resumes and Kabore manages to win a corner, and Doughty will take. He delivers towards the back post and Morris heads towards goal, but Mateta is there to clear.
Barkley has gone down inside the Palace penalty area after a clash of heads, and the medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment. There's going to be a delay as the physios treat the English midfielder. The Luton star attempted to head towards goal, but collided with Ward.
Barkley is still receiving treatment and appears to be bleeding from the nose. It's a nasty injury for the former Everton man. After a lengthy delay, he's back on his feet. It looks as though he's going to be able to continue after the Luton medical team patch him up.
Ward sends a ball down the line and Mateta will chase it in beyond the Luton defence. The towering striker gets there and looks to deliver into the penalty area, but Kaminski darts off his line and is able to collect. It's been a cagey affair so far with neither side showing much of a threat in the final third.
GOOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 1-0 PALACE!! Doughty looks to pass the ball back to his goalkeeper, but he doesn't get enough on it and Munoz races through on goal. He gets there before Kaminski and rounds the goalkeeper. He's forced out wide but he finds Mateta in the middle, and the French striker flicks the ball into the back of the net! It's a wonderful finish!
Munoz did superbly to round the goalkeeper and stay composed, finding Mateta in the middle.
Eze dances through the Luton midfield and feeds the ball out wide to Ayew. The Palace forward takes a touch and delivers into the penalty area towards Mateta, but Kabore gets back well to fire it behind for a corner. Wharton will take and he delivers into the box, but it's headed away from danger.
Ayew twists and turns on the right-hand side of the box and looks to deliver into the danger zone, but his cross is deflected behind for a corner. Wharton is standing over it and he plays it short to Lerma. The Palace midfielder takes a touch before whipping it towards the front post, but Ward sends his header over the bar.
Glasner's side have enjoyed a positive start to the game, producing three shots with one of those being on target. The Eagles are getting into some dangerous areas, but the Palace boss will be hoping to see some better end product in the final third. Edwards' men will have to tighten up at the back.
Chong sends Doughty down the left-hand side and Luton have an opportunity to break. The wing-back delivers into the box, but it's cleared away from danger. Morris is eventually found inside the box unmarked, but his cross is poor and Johnstone comes off his line to collect comfortably.
Clark drives through the middle and looks to find Morris inside the penalty area, but his pass cannons back into his path. He attempts to deliver a cross into the box, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Doughty is there to take and he sends a searching ball towards the back post, but Richards rises highest to head it away.
Palace have a throw-in inside the Luton half and they look to remain patient and keep possession. Richards carries it out of defence and finds Eze. He sends a searching pass beyond the Luton backline to Mitchell, but he can't quite control it and the Hatters win it back.
Kabore goes into the book for a strong challenge on Lerma just outside the Luton penalty area.
From the resulting free-kick, Eze delivers a powerful cross towards the front post. It's headed on by Andersen, but it cannons off Mengi and goes behind for a corner. Palace take it short and it comes to Lerma who unleashes an ambitious effort from range, but it strikes a defender and flies into the stands behind the goal.
Wharton finds Eze inside the Luton penalty area and he tussles with Mengi with his back to goal. The English midfielder turns and looks to strike it, but it's a tame effort and it flies into the air, with Kaminski coming off his line to gather comfortably.
Doughty is found on the left-hand side and he gets the ball out of his feet before looking to deliver it into the box, but it cannons off Munoz and goes behind for another corner. It's whipped towards the back post and Osho wins the initial header, but the Eagles are able to clear away from danger.
Mateta tussles with Mengi and drives with the ball down the right-hand side, but the Luton defender brings him down with a strong challenge. The Palace forward looks in a bit of discomfort, but he should be fine to continue. Wharton and Eze are standing over the free-kick and the former delivers it, but it evades everyone and goes behind for a goal-kick.
Eze receives a yellow card for bringing down Burke as Luton looked to break away.
Eze fires the ball into the feet of Mateta, who holds off the Luton defenders before laying it into the path of Ayew. The Palace forward drives towards the penalty area and gets it out of his feet before unleashing from range, but Kaminski gets down to his right to make the stop and holds onto the ball.
What a chance! Clark receives the ball in the middle and looks to pass it back to his goalkeeper. It's almost a carbon copy of the earlier goal as Mateta rushes in to get there first. He takes it past Kaminski and looks to chip it back towards goal, but he fails to hit the target! He has to be scoring from there!
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of four minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Luton win a free-kick deep inside the Palace half as Andersen drags Morris to the ground. The Hatters have a chance to fill the box in the final few minutes of the half. Barkley delivers into the box and Osho flicks it towards goal, but his header loops over the bar and lands on the roof of the net.
HALF-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 1-0 LUTON TOWN
Crystal Palace go into the break with a 1-0 lead over Luton Town at Selhurst Park. Glasner will be the happier of the two managers at half-time with his side showing plenty of attacking threat in the final third. The home team have limited their opposition for the most part, with the Eagles enjoying the better chances. Palace opened the scoring in the first half after Doughty's pass back towards his own goalkeeper was intercepted by Muniz, and the wing-back did superbly to find Mateta in the penalty area, and his clever flick rolled into the back of the net. Glasner's men kept on pushing and should have found a second after Mateta pounced on another mistake at the back, but his dink over Kaminski trickled wide of the post. Edwards will be desperate to see his side tighten up at the back, while they need to provide more of a threat going forward.
Luton have created just 0.09 expected goals (xG) in the game so far from two shots. Palace have produced 1.1 expected goals and look the more likely to grab the second goal of the game. The Eagles have managed six shots inside the opposition box, forcing Kaminiski into one save. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Edwards make an early change after the break, with Townsend, who started in their previous fixture, waiting in the wings. Glasner might not want to alter his side too much with his game plan working so far. The home team will be desperate to find a second goal early on after half-time, with the Hatters capable of producing goals out of nothing.
Ayew gets the second half under way for Palace at Selhurst Park!
What a chance! Wharton finds Eze on the left-hand side and he delivers into the penalty area. Munoz has burst forward from defence and he tussles with Burke. He looks to head towards goal from just a few yards out, but he doesn't connect with the header and the opportunity goes begging.
Lerma chips the ball to Ayew who has found space inside the penalty area. He spots the run of Munoz on the overlap and finds him. The Palace wing-back looks to pull it to the edge of the box where Ayew is waiting, but the Luton defenders rush back in numbers to intercept and clear the danger.
Palace have a throw-in deep inside the opposition half and Munoz finds Ward. The ball is pumped into the box towards Eze who controls superbly. He gets it out of his feet and strikes it, but his effort flies into the stands behind the goal and Luton will have a goal-kick.
Glasner's side are asserting their dominance in the second half and Luton have struggled to create too many chances. Edwards' men are yet to touch the ball inside the opposition box since the break, and Palace have barely looked troubled from a defensive standpoint.
Burke goes into the book for a strong challenge as Palace look to counter-attack.
Wharton drives through the middle of the park and finds Lerma, and he shifts the ball to Eze on the edge of the Luton penalty area. He twists and turns before working it into his left foot and he strikes from outside of the box, but it's a tame effort and Kaminski can gather comfortably.
Edwards makes a change as Hashioka enters the fray. Mengi is the player to head to the bench.
Andersen finds himself in space between the Luton midfield and defence and he picks out Mateta on the edge of the area. Ayew has made a run outside of him and the French forward lays it into his path. He strikes towards goal with his right, but the Hatters get plenty of bodies in the way and block the shot.
Chance for Luton! Doughty receives a pass out wide and looks to take on Munoz. He shifts it out of his feet before delivering into the penalty area. Morris gets there first and heads towards goal, but it's straight at Johnstone and the Palace goalkeeper makes a comfortable save.
Morris drives down the left-hand side of the pitch and bursts past Anderson before attempting to find a team-mate in the box, but his cross deflects off the Palace centre-back and goes behind for a corner. Doughty will deliver, but it's headed behind by Andersen. The Luton wing-back will take again, but Richards is able to clear the danger.
Glasner makes an alteration in attack as Ahamada comes off the bench. Ayew will make way for Palace.
Luton are enjoying more of the possession in the second half, managing to have 55.6 per cent of the ball. However, Edwards' side have struggled to turn that into clear-cut opportunities and have attempted just one shot since the break.
Huge chance for Palace! Eze feeds the ball to Mitchell inside the penalty area and he stands up his marker before creating space for a cross. He whips a dangerous delivery into the box and Mateta is there to meet it from just a few yards out, but his volley is somehow saved by Kaminski! What a stop!
The ball comes to Ahamada outside of the box and he strikes from range, but his effort is blocked. Luton are able to clear and Palace regain possession. The Eagles can't quite find a breakthrough in the final third and it's a slender lead for Glasner's side, so they will have to be wary at the back.
There's a bit of delay as Osho goes down and he requires treatment from the Palace physios. He's eventually back to his feet and he heads towards the side of the pitch, and there's some activity on the Luton bench. He could be heading off.
Glasner makes a change in attack and it's a straight swap, with Edouard coming on for Mateta.
Osho's game is over after his injury, and Woodrow comes on to replace him.
Palace make an alteration in the middle of the park. Hughes comes off the bench in place of Wharton.
So close! Eze receives the ball just inside the Luton half and he spots Kaminski off his line. He attempts an ambitious strike from near the halfway line and his strike is heading towards goal, but it doesn't quite dip in time and it bounces off the roof of the net! What an effort!
Luton hit the bar! Doughty's cross into the penalty area looks as though it's heading out for a goal-kick, but Ogbene does superbly to help it back into the danger zone. His looping delivery is heading towards goal, but it bounces off the top of the bar and goes behind.
Munoz is the latest player to receive a yellow for a late challenge on Chong.
Luton make an attacking alteration, with Ogbene heading off and Townsend entering the fray.
Edwards rolls the dice once again with Nelson sent on in the final few minutes. Chong is the player to be replaced.

Berry receives a yellow for a reckless challenge as Palace attempted to counter-attack.
Palace are continuing to push for a second goal as Mitchell feeds Eze on the edge of the penalty area. The English midfielder turns well before poking an effort towards goal, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Eze will take and it's delivered into the box, but Morris is there to head away from danger.
Off the bar! Luton appeal for a free-kick but the referee is having none of it and Mitchell finds Edouard in space. He drives towards the penalty area and produces a powerful effort from the edge of the box, and it flies towards goal before slamming against the bar! The Eagles are searching for a second.
GOOOAAAAALLLL!! 1-1!! LUTON EQUALISE! The Hatters throw everything forward and Townsend gets the ball out of his feet on the right-hand side before delivering a dangerous ball into the penalty area. Woodrow gets there first and flicks it towards goal, and it bounces into the far corner of the net with Johnstone scrambling! Edwards' side find an equaliser in the last few seconds!
Townsend whipped a perfect cross onto the head of Woodrow, who flicked it home.
FULL-TIME: CRYSTAL PALACE 1-1 LUTON TOWN
Crystal Palace and Luton Town share the points with a 1-1 draw at Selhurst Park. The Eagles started the brighter and were looking a threat in the final third, and it didn't take them long to find the opening goal. Munoz pounced on a mistake at the back from Doughty before rounding the goalkeeper, and his pass into the box was flicked home by Mateta. Glasner's side kept pushing for a second, but Palace went into the break with a slender lead. In the second half, the home team had a host of chances to put the game to bed, with Mateta missing from just a few yards out. The 1-0 advantage was always going to be dangerous as the Hatters threw everything at it in the final few moments, and they found an equaliser late on. Townsend worked the ball onto his left and whipped a dangerous cross into the box, and Woodrow was there to head it home in the final seconds. Luton are on the road again on Wednesday, playing Bournemouth in the Premier League, while Palace will have to wait until 30th March for their next game, where they play Nottingham Forest. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Nicolo Zaniolo came off the bench to earn Aston Villa a point as they came from behind to draw 1-1 at West Ham United.
Michail Antonio gave the Hammers a first-half lead, heading in to score for the first time since August, but Zaniolo poked in to level with 11 minutes remaining.
West Ham had the ball in the back of the net deep into stoppage time, but Tomas Soucek's effort was overturned following a VAR review for handball. 
A point moves Villa three clear of Tottenham Hotspur in fifth, with West Ham, who extended their unbeaten home run against Villa to nine matches, remaining in seventh.
How the match unfolded
West Ham made two changes from the side that beat Freiburg 5-0 in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday, with Alphonse Areola replacing Lukasz Fabianski in goal, while and Emerson Palmieri came in for Aaron Cresswell.
Unai Emery opted to make four changes from the midweek 4-0 UEFA Europa Conference victory over Ajax. 
Jhon Duran, Youri Tielemans, Ezri Konsa and Clement Lenglet replaced Matty Cash, Diego Carlos, Moussa Diaby and the suspended John McGinn. Ollie Watkins was fit to start after recovering from a cut to his knee that forced him off on Thursday night.
After an evenly contested start, the first clear chance fell to Watkins, but his low effort was pushed around a post by Areola.
West Ham took the lead just before the half-hour with Antonio's superb diving header from Vladimir Coufal's cross.
Coufal has now provided an assist in each of his last five league matches at London Stadium. 
The Hammers continued to look dangerous and Mohammed Kudus twice came close to doubling their advantage, first firing a shot narrowly wide, West Ham’s ninth of the half, before having a goal ruled out due to a foul in the build-up.
Antonio thought he had doubled West Ham's lead on 49 minutes but, but his effort overturned following a VAR review after he was adjudged to have handled the ball.
Villa stepped up the pressure in search of an equaliser and Areola was forced to keep out a trademark long-range shot from Tielemans.
At the other end, Emiliano Martinez was called into action as he dived to prevent Lucas Paqueta's deflected free-kick from creeping in.
Zaniolo brought Villa level, finishing first time from close range after Diaby had got the better of Emerson and cut the ball back to the Italian.
Both of Zaniolo’s Premier League goals for Villa this season have been second-half equalisers after coming off the bench.
West Ham almost snatched a late winner, but substitute James Ward-Prowse’s strike in the second minute of stoppage time was superbly blocked by Cash.
There was still time for a dramatic finale, as Ward-Prowse’s free-kick was poked towards goal by Konstantinos Mavropanos before being bundled in on the goalline by Soucek.
But after being checked by VAR, referee Jarred Gillett was sent to the Referee Review Area and ruled out the goal, deeming it to have been handled by Soucek."	Team_19	Team_2	"[""Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_8 and Team_12 at Selhurst Park.\nThe Eagles will be playing their third game under the guidance of new manager Oliver Glasner, who has overseen a 3-0 victory over Team_6 and a 3-1 loss away at Team_18 so far. Palace have won three of their last four Premier League games at Selhurst Park (L1), as many as in their previous 13 beforehand (D5 L5). The Eagles have scored exactly three goals in each of those three wins, after having only scored three or more goals in three of their previous 31 home league matches prior to this. Team_8 are in 14th place on 28 points, having scored 32 goals and conceded 47. A victory could see them climb above Team_3 into 13th position if results go their way.\nLuton travel to Selhurst Park hoping to do the double over the capital club, having won the previous meeting 2-1 at Kenilworth Road, with Teden Mengi and Jacob Brown scoring their goals. However, Rob Edwards’ side are on a disappointing run of form, losing each of their last four games in the Premier League. The Hatters suffered a 3-2 defeat against Team_2 at Kenilworth Road in their last Premier League match, extending their winless streak to five (D1 L4), putting them in 18th place on 20 points, four points from safety with 12 matches to play.\nTeam_8 (3-4-2-1): Sam Johnstone; Chris Richards, Joachim Andersen, Joel Ward; Tyrick Mitchell, Adam Wharton, Jefferson Lerma, Daniel Munoz; Eberechi Eze, Jordan Ayew; Jean-Philippe Mateta.\nTeam_8 SUBS: James Tomkins, Nathaniel Clyne, Will Hughes, Odsonne Edouard, Naouirou Ahamada, Dean Henderson, Luke Plange, Kaden Rodney, David Ozoh.\nTeam_12 (3-4-2-1): Thomas Kaminski; Teden Mengi, Gabriel Osho, Reece Burke; Alfie Doughty, Ross Barkley, Jordan Clark, Issa Kabore; Tahith Chong, Chiedozie Ogbene; Carlton Morris.\nTeam_12 SUBS: James Shea, Luke Berry, Cauley Woodrow, Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, Tim Krul, Daiki Hashioka, Andros Townsend, Zack Nelson, Axel Piesold.\nGlasner has named an unchanged side from Palace’s 3-1 defeat away to Team_18 in the Premier League last time out. The Austrian manager is still working out his best team after a few weeks in charge, and he’s given the previous starting XI another chance to impress.\nMeanwhile, Edwards has made two alterations from Luton’s 3-2 defeat at home to Team_2 in their previous game. In defence, Amari'i Bell misses out due to injury, and Osho comes into the starting XI. Ogbene will also come into the side, with Townsend dropping to the bench.\nThe players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.\nMorris gets the game under way for Luton at Selhurst Park!\nClark looks to find Kabore down the right-hand side and he battles with Mitchell, winning a throw-in deep inside the Palace half. Play resumes and Kabore manages to win a corner, and Doughty will take. He delivers towards the back post and Morris heads towards goal, but Mateta is there to clear.\nBarkley has gone down inside the Palace penalty area after a clash of heads, and the medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment. There's going to be a delay as the physios treat the English midfielder. The Luton star attempted to head towards goal, but collided with Ward.\nBarkley is still receiving treatment and appears to be bleeding from the nose. It's a nasty injury for the former Team_9 man. After a lengthy delay, he's back on his feet. It looks as though he's going to be able to continue after the Luton medical team patch him up.\nWard sends a ball down the line and Mateta will chase it in beyond the Luton defence. The towering striker gets there and looks to deliver into the penalty area, but Kaminski darts off his line and is able to collect. It's been a cagey affair so far with neither side showing much of a threat in the final third.\nGOOOOOAAAAAALLLL!!! 1-0 PALACE!! Doughty looks to pass the ball back to his goalkeeper, but he doesn't get enough on it and Munoz races through on goal. He gets there before Kaminski and rounds the goalkeeper. He's forced out wide but he finds Mateta in the middle, and the French striker flicks the ball into the back of the net! It's a wonderful finish!\nMunoz did superbly to round the goalkeeper and stay composed, finding Mateta in the middle.\nEze dances through the Luton midfield and feeds the ball out wide to Ayew. The Palace forward takes a touch and delivers into the penalty area towards Mateta, but Kabore gets back well to fire it behind for a corner. Wharton will take and he delivers into the box, but it's headed away from danger.\nAyew twists and turns on the right-hand side of the box and looks to deliver into the danger zone, but his cross is deflected behind for a corner. Wharton is standing over it and he plays it short to Lerma. The Palace midfielder takes a touch before whipping it towards the front post, but Ward sends his header over the bar.\nGlasner's side have enjoyed a positive start to the game, producing three shots with one of those being on target. The Eagles are getting into some dangerous areas, but the Palace boss will be hoping to see some better end product in the final third. Edwards' men will have to tighten up at the back.\nChong sends Doughty down the left-hand side and Luton have an opportunity to break. The wing-back delivers into the box, but it's cleared away from danger. Morris is eventually found inside the box unmarked, but his cross is poor and Johnstone comes off his line to collect comfortably.\nClark drives through the middle and looks to find Morris inside the penalty area, but his pass cannons back into his path. He attempts to deliver a cross into the box, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Doughty is there to take and he sends a searching ball towards the back post, but Richards rises highest to head it away.\nPalace have a throw-in inside the Luton half and they look to remain patient and keep possession. Richards carries it out of defence and finds Eze. He sends a searching pass beyond the Luton backline to Mitchell, but he can't quite control it and the Hatters win it back.\nKabore goes into the book for a strong challenge on Lerma just outside the Luton penalty area.\nFrom the resulting free-kick, Eze delivers a powerful cross towards the front post. It's headed on by Andersen, but it cannons off Mengi and goes behind for a corner. Palace take it short and it comes to Lerma who unleashes an ambitious effort from range, but it strikes a defender and flies into the stands behind the goal.\nWharton finds Eze inside the Luton penalty area and he tussles with Mengi with his back to goal. The English midfielder turns and looks to strike it, but it's a tame effort and it flies into the air, with Kaminski coming off his line to gather comfortably.\nDoughty is found on the left-hand side and he gets the ball out of his feet before looking to deliver it into the box, but it cannons off Munoz and goes behind for another corner. It's whipped towards the back post and Osho wins the initial header, but the Eagles are able to clear away from danger.\nMateta tussles with Mengi and drives with the ball down the right-hand side, but the Luton defender brings him down with a strong challenge. The Palace forward looks in a bit of discomfort, but he should be fine to continue. Wharton and Eze are standing over the free-kick and the former delivers it, but it evades everyone and goes behind for a goal-kick.\nEze receives a yellow card for bringing down Burke as Luton looked to break away.\nEze fires the ball into the feet of Mateta, who holds off the Luton defenders before laying it into the path of Ayew. The Palace forward drives towards the penalty area and gets it out of his feet before unleashing from range, but Kaminski gets down to his right to make the stop and holds onto the ball.\nWhat a chance! Clark receives the ball in the middle and looks to pass it back to his goalkeeper. It's almost a carbon copy of the earlier goal as Mateta rushes in to get there first. He takes it past Kaminski and looks to chip it back towards goal, but he fails to hit the target! He has to be scoring from there!\nThe fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of four minutes of added time at the end of the first half.\nLuton win a free-kick deep inside the Palace half as Andersen drags Morris to the ground. The Hatters have a chance to fill the box in the final few minutes of the half. Barkley delivers into the box and Osho flicks it towards goal, but his header loops over the bar and lands on the roof of the net.\nHALF-TIME: Team_8 1-0 Team_12\nTeam_8 go into the break with a 1-0 lead over Team_12 at Selhurst Park. Glasner will be the happier of the two managers at half-time with his side showing plenty of attacking threat in the final third. The home team have limited their opposition for the most part, with the Eagles enjoying the better chances. Palace opened the scoring in the first half after Doughty's pass back towards his own goalkeeper was intercepted by Muniz, and the wing-back did superbly to find Mateta in the penalty area, and his clever flick rolled into the back of the net. Glasner's men kept on pushing and should have found a second after Mateta pounced on another mistake at the back, but his dink over Kaminski trickled wide of the post. Edwards will be desperate to see his side tighten up at the back, while they need to provide more of a threat going forward.\nLuton have created just 0.09 expected goals (xG) in the game so far from two shots. Palace have produced 1.1 expected goals and look the more likely to grab the second goal of the game. The Eagles have managed six shots inside the opposition box, forcing Kaminiski into one save. It wouldn't be a surprise to see Edwards make an early change after the break, with Townsend, who started in their previous fixture, waiting in the wings. Glasner might not want to alter his side too much with his game plan working so far. The home team will be desperate to find a second goal early on after half-time, with the Hatters capable of producing goals out of nothing.\nAyew gets the second half under way for Palace at Selhurst Park!\nWhat a chance! Wharton finds Eze on the left-hand side and he delivers into the penalty area. Munoz has burst forward from defence and he tussles with Burke. He looks to head towards goal from just a few yards out, but he doesn't connect with the header and the opportunity goes begging.\nLerma chips the ball to Ayew who has found space inside the penalty area. He spots the run of Munoz on the overlap and finds him. The Palace wing-back looks to pull it to the edge of the box where Ayew is waiting, but the Luton defenders rush back in numbers to intercept and clear the danger.\nPalace have a throw-in deep inside the opposition half and Munoz finds Ward. The ball is pumped into the box towards Eze who controls superbly. He gets it out of his feet and strikes it, but his effort flies into the stands behind the goal and Luton will have a goal-kick.\nGlasner's side are asserting their dominance in the second half and Luton have struggled to create too many chances. Edwards' men are yet to touch the ball inside the opposition box since the break, and Palace have barely looked troubled from a defensive standpoint.\nBurke goes into the book for a strong challenge as Palace look to counter-attack.\nWharton drives through the middle of the park and finds Lerma, and he shifts the ball to Eze on the edge of the Luton penalty area. He twists and turns before working it into his left foot and he strikes from outside of the box, but it's a tame effort and Kaminski can gather comfortably.\nEdwards makes a change as Hashioka enters the fray. Mengi is the player to head to the bench.\nAndersen finds himself in space between the Luton midfield and defence and he picks out Mateta on the edge of the area. Ayew has made a run outside of him and the French forward lays it into his path. He strikes towards goal with his right, but the Hatters get plenty of bodies in the way and block the shot.\nChance for Luton! Doughty receives a pass out wide and looks to take on Munoz. He shifts it out of his feet before delivering into the penalty area. Morris gets there first and heads towards goal, but it's straight at Johnstone and the Palace goalkeeper makes a comfortable save.\nMorris drives down the left-hand side of the pitch and bursts past Anderson before attempting to find a team-mate in the box, but his cross deflects off the Palace centre-back and goes behind for a corner. Doughty will deliver, but it's headed behind by Andersen. The Luton wing-back will take again, but Richards is able to clear the danger.\nGlasner makes an alteration in attack as Ahamada comes off the bench. Ayew will make way for Palace.\nLuton are enjoying more of the possession in the second half, managing to have 55.6 per cent of the ball.

93501	Arsenal	West Ham	2023-12-28	Emirates Stadium, London	60261.0	Michael Oliver	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield.
The hosts head into what could be a pivotal game in the title race with the opportunity to move top, needing a win to do so. They bounced back from a disappointing 0-0 home league draw against rivals Manchester United with a resounding 5-1 EFL Cup victory over West Ham in midweek, and Jurgen Klopp will be hoping for more of the same from his side here.
First place in the Premier League currently belongs to the Gunners, who have lost just two of their 17 outings in the competition, taking 39 points over that time. Aston Villa's 1-1 draw with Sheffield United on Friday meant Arsenal held onto top spot, though that would change with a defeat at Anfield for Mikel Arteta's men, heading to a ground where they have struggled in recent times.
LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk, Konstantinos Tsimikas; Curtis Jones, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo; Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz.
SUBS: Ryan Gravenberch, Jarell Quansah, Harvey Elliott, Darwin Nunez, James McConnel, Bobby Clark, Conor Bradley, Joe Gomez, Caoimhin Kelleher.
ARSENAL (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBS: Leandro Trossard, Mohamed Elneny, Reiss Nelson, Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe, Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jorginho, Jakub Kiwior.
Klopp makes five changes from the cup thumping of West Ham, with Alisson returning between the sticks, while Alexander-Arnold and Konate come into the back four for Gomez and Quansah. Elliott and Nunez drop to the bench, with Salah and Diaz back in the starting XI.
Arteta names an unchanged side from the 2-0 home win over Brighton last weekend, with Havertz and Jesus, who scored the Gunners' goals in that game, retaining their places in the starting XI. Jorginho and Elneny return to the bench.
The two teams make their way onto the Anfield pitch ahead of kick-off. Who will be top at Christmas? We will find out shortly!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way in Liverpool!
A quick start from Arsenal sees Jesus send a deflected volley just over. Arteta would love an early goal to quieten the home crowd!
Saka's inswinging corner is nodded towards goal by Jesus, though it does not have the power or direction to trouble Alisson, who makes a comfortable save. It's been a really positive start from the Gunners, though.
Szoboszlai looks a little shaken up after a coming-together with Havertz, though he eventually gets back to his feet. The midfielder is moving a little gingerly, however.
GOOOAAALLL!!! GABRIEL PUTS ARSENAL IN FRONT!!! That will be just the start Arteta would have wanted as his team take an early lead at Anfield. Odegaard whips a teasing free-kick into the Liverpool box, and a towering header from Gabriel sends the ball flying past Alisson and in to put the Gunners 1-0 up!
Odegaard's delivery allowed Gabriel to leap highest and nod home.
The Gunners started brightly and have now turned that promise into an early lead. There is plenty of time left, however, and Klopp will not be panicking just yet.
Tsimikas leaves Saka in a heap after catching the winger with a stray arm while trying to hold him off. Fortunately for the Gunners, their young star is able to continue. The battle between Saka and Tsimikas could prove pivotal in this game.
Gabriel has been the highest-scoring defender in the Premier League since he joined Arsenal in September 2020. He is such a threat at set-pieces.
Liverpool's response to falling behind has been decent, though they are yet to fashion a real clear-cut chance. The likes of Salah and Gakpo are yet to get into the game, and Klopp will be wanting his key attacking players to get more involved.
Endo floats a cross into the box, and Gakpo manages to flick the ball on to the back post. Zinchenko's decision to go for the header means Salah is in space when he receives the ball, but the winger's first-time volley only crashes into the side-netting.
Liverpool had 71.9 per cent possession over the opening 15 minutes of this game, though they managed just the one shot. They are yet to test Raya between the Arsenal sticks.
Arsenal have avoided defeat in their last 47 matches when scoring the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to January 1, 2022 against Manchester City (L1-2). Liverpool have it all to do if they are to leapfrog the Gunners to the league's summit.
Liverpool want a spot-kick after Odegaard handles in the penalty area, though a VAR check stays with the on-field decision not to award a penalty. The Arsenal captain is perhaps a little fortunate there.
The tempo of the game has just slowed a little in the last couple of minutes after a frantic start. Arsenal have posed much more of an attacking threat than their hosts, managing six shots to Liverpool's two, while they have the all-important lead thanks to Gabriel's opener.
Of the last eight instances a side has scored inside five minutes against Liverpool at Anfield in the Premier League, only two have gone on to win. The Reds usually find a way back into the game.
The visitors have defended brilliantly so far, keeping Liverpool's front three of Salah, Gakpo and Diaz very quiet to this point. That trio has combined for just five touches in the Gunners' box, while only Salah has had a shot.
GOOOAAALLL!!! SALAH LEVELS FOR LIVERPOOL!!! It all comes from a delightful pass from Alexander-Arnold, who lofts a superb ball over the top for Salah. The winger takes on Zinchenko, breezing past the full-back to cut back onto his left foot, before unleashing a powerful finish past Raya and in to make it 1-1!
Alexander-Arnold set Salah away with a brilliant pass. The defender is such an asset with the ball at his feet.
Salah has now scored 10 goals in 14 appearances in the Premier League against Arsenal, while Alexander-Arnold has managed seven league assists against the Gunners, who will be sick at the sight of that pair combining to put the ball in their net again.
A comedic moment sees Saka send Tsimikas flying over the touchline, subsequently wiping out Klopp! The Liverpool manager will not be laughing at the sight of Tsimikas down injured, however, and the hosts may be forced into a change.
Tsimikas is indeed forced off after the tackle from Saka, clutching at his shoulder as he heads down the tunnel. With Robertson also out injured, Gomez is the man chosen to deputise.
Alexander-Arnold has now assisted 57 Premier League goals, the joint-most by a defender in the competition's history, alongside team-mate Andy Robertson.
Saka receives the first booking of the game for cynically wiping out Jones in midfield.
Salah spurns a great opportunity to get a shot away as Liverpool catch Arsenal out on the counter. The Egypt international tries to slide through a pass for Gakpo instead of shooting, which proves to be a poor decision as the overhit pass goes straight into the waiting hands of Raya.
WHAT A CHANCE!!! Jesus slides Saka through on goal, though his heavy touch means he has to take the ball away from goal in his attempts to evade the oncoming Alisson. The ball finds its way to Martinelli, who slips before finally getting a shot away, though his effort flies wide of the left post! That is a big let-off for the hosts.
Salah has been directly involved in 121 goals in 120 appearances in the Premier League for Liverpool at Anfield (88 goals, 33 assists), the outright most of any player for the club
There will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Endo goes in the book for hauling back Martinelli, who was on the charge with the ball at his feet.
Havertz receives a yellow card for bringing down Endo. The Germany international will now miss the Gunners' next game, against West Ham on Thursday.
HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 1-1 ARSENAL
The half-time whistle blows as the two teams head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 1-1 at Anfield between Liverpool and Arsenal. It was the visitors who took the lead, Gabriel getting up well to meet Odegaard's free-kick delivery, nodding into the back of the net to put the Gunners a goal up. The hosts responded, though, as Salah latched onto Alexander-Arnold's exquisite long ball before smashing into the back of the net to ensure the teams go into the break at one apiece.
As it stands, it's Arsenal who will be topping the Premier League at Christmas. Liverpool grew into the game in that first half, however, and Klopp will be demanding even more from his team after the interval as they bid to leapfrog the Gunners to the summit.
The hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half at Anfield. Can they find a winner and put themselves top of the Premier League?
Rice gets caught the wrong side of Gakpo and pulls him back, receiving a booking for his troubles.
Liverpool catch the visitors in possession in a dangerous area, though Salah's shot is deflected harmlessly into the hands of Raya. A player of his quality will have expected to do better there.
The game is end to end at the moment, with both sides showing plenty of attacking intent. With so much at stake, both teams are looking to go for all three points.
CLOSE! Liverpool are on top, and Gomez nearly puts them ahead. The hosts again catch Arsenal in possession, and the ball is worked out to Gomez. The defender cuts onto his right foot before firing goalwards, though his curling effort doesn't quite bend enough as it flies just past the post.
This is Liverpool’s 100th home game against Arsenal in league competition, just the second side to visit the Reds as many times after Everton (105). Liverpool have only won more league games against Aston Villa (59) and Newcastle (58) than against the Gunners (55), though only Manchester United (25) have won more visits than Arsenal (24).
Which manager will look to their bench to boost their team's chances of winning the game? Arteta has all five substitutions available, while Tsimikas' enforced exit earlier means Klopp has just the four.
Odegaard lays the ball back for Zinchenko to hit from outside the box, but the full-back's shot is flashed high and wide of the target. That is the closest the Gunners have come to scoring in a while.
Szoboszlai tries his luck from range, though the midfielder can only drag well wide of the left post. He will be disappointed not to have at least forced a save out of Raya there.
Liverpool have had 30 pressures resulting in an opposition turnover, compared to just 13 for Arsenal. The hosts have been in the faces of the visitors all game.
Liverpool may be forced into another change here with Diaz down in pain, clutching at his right knee after a coming-together with Saka.
Diaz will play no further part in the game, limping off the field. Elliott is on in his place.
Klopp also replaces Gakpo with Nunez, who receives a warm reception from the home crowd. Could he be the man to create a winning goal for Liverpool?
Jones also makes way for Gravenberch.
Arteta's first substitution sees him replace Martinelli with Trossard.
Nunez has two goals and two assists in his last four substitute appearances in the Premier League.
OFF THE POST! Elliott looks to make an instant impact as he cuts in and fires. His shot takes a nick off Gabriel's shoulder and diverts towards the bottom corner, though the ball comes off the outside of the post and goes wide.
CROSSBAR!!! Liverpool are inches away from taking the lead! Arsenal make a complete mess of a corner, and the hosts are away. The Gunners are seriously outnumbered, and Salah charges deep into the visitors' territory before laying the ball into the path of Alexander-Arnold. The defender races onto the ball before thumping goalwards, but the ball comes crashing off the frame of the goal!
The hosts win a couple of corners in quick succession, but Nunez can only head over from the second of those set-pieces. Liverpool are looking the more likely to find a winner, though Arsenal also still pose a threat.
Arteta looks to freshen up his attack, bringing on Nketiah for Jesus up top. What impact will that change have?
Zinchenko rattles goalwards from range, but Konate gets in the way to make a brave block. It's been a little better from Arsenal in the last couple of minutes as they look to find a winner.
Havertz goes down in the box under Alexander-Arnold's challenge, and though the away team claim for a penalty, the referee instead waves play on.
Salah goes in the book after bringing down a marauding Nketiah. The yellow card may also be partly down to his furious reaction to the referee's decision to penalise him.
Nketiah's late challenge on Endo sees him receive a yellow card from referee Chris Kavanagh.
A point would probably suit the visitors more than their hosts, with a draw keeping their place at the summit at a ground where they have found it tough in recent times.
White receives a late booking for handling as Nunez looked to lead Liverpool on the counter.
We are well into five minutes of additional time at the end of this game. Can one of these teams find a winner?
Neither side has been able to really take the initiative in this added time, with both sets of players looking a little weary after a frantic game.
FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 1-1 ARSENAL
The full-time whistle blows as Liverpool and Arsenal are forced to settle for a point each after a 1-1 draw at Anfield. It was the Gunners who took the lead after just four minutes, Gabriel rising highest to meet Odegaard's free-kick, nodding past Alisson and in to put Arsenal a goal up. Liverpool responded, though, with Salah latching onto Alexander-Arnold's long ball before cutting in and lashing home to level. The hosts twice hit the woodwork in their pursuit of a winner, with Elliott going close off the bench before Alexander-Arnold thumped a great opportunity off the crossbar as the scoreline finished one apiece. The result means Arsenal will be top at Christmas, holding a one-point lead over second-placed Liverpool. The Gunners will host West Ham on Thursday as they bid to keep their place at the summit, while Liverpool travel to Turf Moor to take on Burnley on Tuesday. That is all we have for you from Anfield, so thanks for your company and goodbye!"	"West Ham United denied London rivals Arsenal a return to the top of the table as they inflicted on the Gunners a first home defeat of the season, winning 2-0 at Emirates Stadium.
Tomas Soucek put the Hammers ahead in the first half and Konstantinos Mavropanos doubled the lead10 minutes after the break, heading in against his former club.
Arsenal were top at Christmas but this defeat leaves them two points behind leaders Liverpool. Meanwhile, West Ham climb to sixth, four points outside the top four.
How the match unfolded
Arsenal began sharply, exerting plenty of pressure but, against the run of play, West Ham took the lead on 13 minutes.
Jarrod Bowen pulled the ball back from the byline to Soucek, who finished at close range, and a VAR review could find no conclusive evidence that the ball had gone out of play before Bowen’s pass.
West Ham were dealt a blow just after the half-hour mark when playmaker Lucas Paqueta, who had appeared to be injured during the warm-up, was eventually forced off and replaced by Said Benrahma.
The Gunners almost equalised five minutes before the break, but Bukayo Saka’s shot hit a post and was scrambled clear by West Ham’s defence.
Early in the second half Declan Rice, facing his former side, took a shot from distance which flew narrowly over the crossbar.
But moments later West Ham doubled their advantage through former Arsenal defender Mavropanos, who rose above Gabriel to power in a header via the crossbar from a James Ward-Prowse corner.
Gabriel Jesus could have done better with a couple of headers of his own, directing the first straight at Alphonse Areola and then sending the second over the bar, and that was the closest Arsenal came to a comeback.
Arsenal had 77 touches in the opposition box in this match, the most on record (since 2008/09) in a single Premier League fixture for a team who failed to score.
West Ham saw out the closing stages in relative comfort, and Benrahma had a big chance to make it 3-0 in stoppage time from the penalty spot, awarded for a foul by Rice on Emerson Palmieri, but his effort was saved by David Raya.

Team_1	Team_19	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_11 and Team_1 at Anfield.\nThe hosts head into what could be a pivotal game in the title race with the opportunity to move top, needing a win to do so. They bounced back from a disappointing 0-0 home league draw against rivals Team_14 with a resounding 5-1 EFL Cup victory over Team_19 in midweek, and Jurgen Klopp will be hoping for more of the same from his side here.\nFirst place in the Premier League currently belongs to the Gunners, who have lost just two of their 17 outings in the competition, taking 39 points over that time. Team_2 1-1 draw with Team_17 on Friday meant Team_1 held onto top spot, though that would change with a defeat at Anfield for Mikel Arteta's men, heading to a ground where they have struggled in recent times.\nTeam_11 (4-3-3): Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ibrahima Konate, Virgil van Dijk, Konstantinos Tsimikas; Curtis Jones, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo; Mohamed Salah, Cody Gakpo, Luis Diaz.\nSUBS: Ryan Gravenberch, Jarell Quansah, Harvey Elliott, Darwin Nunez, James McConnel, Bobby Clark, Conor Bradley, Joe Gomez, Caoimhin Kelleher.\nTeam_1 (4-3-3): David Raya; Ben White, William Saliba, Gabriel Magalhaes, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli.\nSUBS: Leandro Trossard, Mohamed Elneny, Reiss Nelson, Eddie Nketiah, Emile Smith Rowe, Aaron Ramsdale, Cedric Soares, Jorginho, Jakub Kiwior.\nKlopp makes five changes from the cup thumping of Team_19, with Alisson returning between the sticks, while Alexander-Arnold and Konate come into the back four for Gomez and Quansah. Elliott and Nunez drop to the bench, with Salah and Diaz back in the starting XI.\nArteta names an unchanged side from the 2-0 home win over Team_5 last weekend, with Havertz and Jesus, who scored the Gunners' goals in that game, retaining their places in the starting XI. Jorginho and Elneny return to the bench.\nThe two teams make their way onto the Anfield pitch ahead of kick-off. Who will be top at Christmas? We will find out shortly!\nThe visitors kick us off and we are under way in Team_11!\nA quick start from Team_1 sees Jesus send a deflected volley just over. Arteta would love an early goal to quieten the home crowd!\nSaka's inswinging corner is nodded towards goal by Jesus, though it does not have the power or direction to trouble Alisson, who makes a comfortable save. It's been a really positive start from the Gunners, though.\nSzoboszlai looks a little shaken up after a coming-together with Havertz, though he eventually gets back to his feet. The midfielder is moving a little gingerly, however.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! GABRIEL PUTS Team_1 IN FRONT!!! That will be just the start Arteta would have wanted as his team take an early lead at Anfield. Odegaard whips a teasing free-kick into the Team_11 box, and a towering header from Gabriel sends the ball flying past Alisson and in to put the Gunners 1-0 up!\nOdegaard's delivery allowed Gabriel to leap highest and nod home.\nThe Gunners started brightly and have now turned that promise into an early lead. There is plenty of time left, however, and Klopp will not be panicking just yet.\nTsimikas leaves Saka in a heap after catching the winger with a stray arm while trying to hold him off. Fortunately for the Gunners, their young star is able to continue. The battle between Saka and Tsimikas could prove pivotal in this game.\nGabriel has been the highest-scoring defender in the Premier League since he joined Team_1 in September 2020. He is such a threat at set-pieces.\nTeam_11 response to falling behind has been decent, though they are yet to fashion a real clear-cut chance. The likes of Salah and Gakpo are yet to get into the game, and Klopp will be wanting his key attacking players to get more involved.\nEndo floats a cross into the box, and Gakpo manages to flick the ball on to the back post. Zinchenko's decision to go for the header means Salah is in space when he receives the ball, but the winger's first-time volley only crashes into the side-netting.\nTeam_11 had 71.9 per cent possession over the opening 15 minutes of this game, though they managed just the one shot. They are yet to test Raya between the Team_1 sticks.\nTeam_1 have avoided defeat in their last 47 matches when scoring the opening goal in the Premier League dating back to January 1, 2022 against Team_13 (L1-2). Team_11 have it all to do if they are to leapfrog the Gunners to the league's summit.\nTeam_11 want a spot-kick after Odegaard handles in the penalty area, though a VAR check stays with the on-field decision not to award a penalty. The Team_1 captain is perhaps a little fortunate there.\nThe tempo of the game has just slowed a little in the last couple of minutes after a frantic start. Team_1 have posed much more of an attacking threat than their hosts, managing six shots to Team_11 two, while they have the all-important lead thanks to Gabriel's opener.\nOf the last eight instances a side has scored inside five minutes against Team_11 at Anfield in the Premier League, only two have gone on to win. The Reds usually find a way back into the game.\nThe visitors have defended brilliantly so far, keeping Team_11 front three of Salah, Gakpo and Diaz very quiet to this point. That trio has combined for just five touches in the Gunners' box, while only Salah has had a shot.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! SALAH LEVELS FOR Team_11!!! It all comes from a delightful pass from Alexander-Arnold, who lofts a superb ball over the top for Salah. The winger takes on Zinchenko, breezing past the full-back to cut back onto his left foot, before unleashing a powerful finish past Raya and in to make it 1-1!\nAlexander-Arnold set Salah away with a brilliant pass. The defender is such an asset with the ball at his feet.\nSalah has now scored 10 goals in 14 appearances in the Premier League against Team_1, while Alexander-Arnold has managed seven league assists against the Gunners, who will be sick at the sight of that pair combining to put the ball in their net again.\nA comedic moment sees Saka send Tsimikas flying over the touchline, subsequently wiping out Klopp! The Team_11 manager will not be laughing at the sight of Tsimikas down injured, however, and the hosts may be forced into a change.\nTsimikas is indeed forced off after the tackle from Saka, clutching at his shoulder as he heads down the tunnel. With Robertson also out injured, Gomez is the man chosen to deputise.\nAlexander-Arnold has now assisted 57 Premier League goals, the joint-most by a defender in the competition's history, alongside team-mate Andy Robertson.\nSaka receives the first booking of the game for cynically wiping out Jones in midfield.\nSalah spurns a great opportunity to get a shot away as Team_11 catch Team_1 out on the counter. The Egypt international tries to slide through a pass for Gakpo instead of shooting, which proves to be a poor decision as the overhit pass goes straight into the waiting hands of Raya.\nWHAT A CHANCE!!! Jesus slides Saka through on goal, though his heavy touch means he has to take the ball away from goal in his attempts to evade the oncoming Alisson. The ball finds its way to Martinelli, who slips before finally getting a shot away, though his effort flies wide of the left post! That is a big let-off for the hosts.\nSalah has been directly involved in 121 goals in 120 appearances in the Premier League for Team_11 at Anfield (88 goals, 33 assists), the outright most of any player for the club\nThere will be four minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.\nEndo goes in the book for hauling back Martinelli, who was on the charge with the ball at his feet.\nHavertz receives a yellow card for bringing down Endo. The Germany international will now miss the Gunners' next game, against Team_19 on Thursday.\nHALF-TIME: Team_11 1-1 Team_1\nThe half-time whistle blows as the two teams head back to the changing rooms with the scoreline 1-1 at Anfield between Team_11 and Team_1. It was the visitors who took the lead, Gabriel getting up well to meet Odegaard's free-kick delivery, nodding into the back of the net to put the Gunners a goal up.

93543	Brentford	Man City	2024-02-05	Gtech Community Stadium, Brentford	17096.0	Jarred Gillett	"Hello and welcome to this live commentary for the Premier League fixture between West Ham and Bournemouth live from the London Stadium.
After falling to a disappointing late draw against Sheffield United, West Ham enjoyed a much-needed time to reset with the Hammers not in FA Cup fourth-round action last weekend. David Moyes' side will be looking for an immediate reaction, though, having failed to win any of their last four games prior to today. It's been a busy day of outgoings in the transfer market but those fans travelling to the London Stadium tonight will be keen to see three points from those still in the squad as their side look to put pressure on Aston Villa in fifth following their defeat to Newcastle on Tuesday.
Bournemouth, meanwhile, will be heading into this fixture full of confidence after their comprehensive 5-0 win against Swansea in the FA Cup fifth round last Thursday. The Cherries, however, have lost their last two Premier League games and are winless against the Hammers in their last five games (D2, L3). A win tonight would move Andoni Iraola's side above Fulham and into 12th after the Cottagers drew 0-0 with Everton on Tuesday.
WEST HAM (4-3-2-1): Alphonse Areola; Ben Johnson, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Kurt Zouma, Emerson; Kalvin Phillips, Tomas Soucek, Edson Alvarez; Mohammed Kudus, James Ward-Prowse; Jarrod Bowen.
WEST HAM SUBS: Lukasz Fabianski, Divin Mubama, Angelo Ogbonna, Kaelan Casey, Aaron Cresswell, Lewis Orford, Oliver Scarles, Danny Ings, Maxwel Cornet.
BOURNEMOUTH (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Marcos Senesi, Lloyd Kelly; Lewis Cook, Ryan Christie; Antoine Semenyo, Adam Scott, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke.
BOURNEMOUTH SUBS: Mark Travers, Philip Billing, Max Kinsey-Wellings, Luis Sinisterra, Chris Mepham, Gavin Kilkenny, Milos Kerkez, Justin Kluivert, Romain Faivre.
David Moyes makes four changes to his West Ham side that drew 2-2 against Sheffield United last time out. Vladimir Coufal is suspended after picking up a red card and so Ben Johnson comes in at right-back. Further forward, both Cornet and Ings drop to the bench, while Pablo Fornals misses out altogether, with the Spaniard closing in on a deadline-day move to Real Betis. In their place, there is a first start for new signing Kalvin Phillips after joining on loan from Manchester City, while Alvarez and Kudus return from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations respectively.
Andoni Iraola, meanwhile, also names four changes from Bournemouth's 5-0 win FA Cup win against Swansea. Neto and Smith return in goal and defence to replace Travers and James Hill. Further forward, Tavernier is preferred to Sinisterra, while David Brooks is replaced by Semenyo, with the Welshman having recently completed a loan move to Championship side Southampton.
West Ham have kept a clean sheet in each of their last three Premier League home games. The last time they achieved four in a row came between December and January in 2009-10 under Gianfranco Zola.
KICK-OFF! West Ham get us underway here in London for the first half.
GOAAALLL!! BOURNEMOUTH LEAD! 1-0! What a nightmare start in a West Ham shirt for Phillips. The Englishman is caught in possession on the edge of his box and, under pressure from Christie, gifts the ball to Solanke who slots home past Areola. The goal was initially ruled out for offside but the final touch came off the West Ham midfielder so the goal stands.
OVER! West Ham still haven't woken up here as Bournemouth almost have a second. A free-kick is swung in from the left and Senesi fires just over the bar as he strikes the loose ball at the first time of asking.
That's just the third time that West Ham have conceded a first-half goal at home this season. Not the start that Moyes would have been after from his men.
Bournemouth continue to press high up the pitch and force Areola to go long with the kick. Bowen is leading the line tonight but he hasn't got the aerial presence to outmuscle the Bournemouth central defenders.
Moyes is cutting an animated figure on the sideline as he barks orders at his West Ham players. Smith deflects Bowen's corner behind as West Ham win their first corner of the game.
Ward-Prowse swings in the corner to the front post but the delivery is unusually poor from the Englishman and Bournemouth win a goal-kick.
Kudus does well to hassle Kelly off the ball down the left side but Bowen eventually loses the ball on the edge of the box. Bournemouth break before Cook's long-range effort has Areola worried for a moment but the effort sails well wide of the target.
Tavernier feeds Semenyo and it's a great little run from the winger to get himself into the box. His eventual left-footed effort takes a deflection off Mavropanos but goes out for a corner. The corner is whipped in by Scott but Areola clings on after it flicks off Solanke's arm.
West Ham have not clicked into gear so far this match, with the home side registering just one shot so far this game.
Another well-worked move from Bournemouth as Mavropanos heads Scott's fierce cross behind for another corner.
Scott delivers his ball to the near post but Christie's looping header goes comfortably over the bar.
Soucek pulls back Cook in the middle of the park to give away another foul. That's greeted by more groans from the home fans in attendance who are less than impressed with the start their side have made to this contest.
Dominic Solanke has now scored 13 Premier League goals this season – only Joshua King in 2016-17 (16) and Callum Wilson in 2018-19 (14) have scored more in a single top-flight campaign for Bournemouth.
Ward-Prowse is really struggling out on this left flank. The midfielder has had just ten touches of the ball so far this game, the joint-fewest of any West Ham player so far.
A lovely defence-splitting pass from Cook plays Tavernier down the right side of the box. The winger tries to cut the ball towards Solanke but West Ham clear the threat away.
West Ham line up a long throw-in but it's a poor delivery from the centre-back which gets nowhere near the penalty area. That sums up West Ham's first half so far. The home side do win a free-kick shortly after but Ward-Prowse's delivery is cleared away.
Bowen is having to drop deep to get on the ball which isn't an ideal position for the West Ham centre forward. The Englishman gives the ball away cheaply but Semenyo can't make anything stick with his surging run down the right flank.
SAVE! A huge save from Areola to keep the home side in it. Again, West Ham are dispossessed in the middle of the park and Solanke has the ball inside the box in an instant. He shifts it to Semenyo who should score but blasts his effort straight at Areola who makes the vital stop. That should be 2-0.
A superb delivery into the box from Ward-Prowse as he finally gets into an advanced position down the left side. Bowen throws himself at the cross but can't make contact with the header and Neto is able to push the ball away.
Better now from West Ham as Kudus makes a good run to the byline. His cross reaches the onrushing Soucek but the midfielder can't control his header and it's well over the bar from the Czech international.
A lovely turn from Kudus gives Johnson plenty of space on the right side to whip in a cross. His delivery, though, is poor and goes behind the three West Ham players queuing up in the box.
It's been a far better end to the half for the home side who have enjoyed 80 per cent of the ball in these last five minutes.
Tavernier forces a good save from Areola but the flag goes up on Solanke who was offside in the build-up.
Into the first of two minutes of first-half added time we go.
Another good chance for the Cherries on the stroke of half-time. A lovely pass from Christie opens up the pitch as Solankes surges forward. He slides through Semenyo but his left-footed effort is deflected over the bar for a corner.
HALF-TIME: WEST HAM 0-1 BOURNEMOUTH
West Ham trail 1-0 at the break against Bournemouth after Dominic Solanke notched up his 13th goal of the Premier League season. The Cherries striker has been in fine form this season and took just three minutes to add to his tally at the London Stadium, firing home after debutant Kalvin Phillips was caught in possession. The away side should really be two goals to the good but for Alphonse Areola's smart save to deny Antoine Semenyo's well-struck effort. West Ham grew into the game as the half wore on but they still have plenty of work to do after the break to pull this one back.
Moyes should be pleased with how his side ended the first half but they will need to keep that level up for the entirety of the second half. In particular, the Hammers were very sloppy in midfield and often found themselves caught out by Bournemouth's press.
KICK-OFF! Bournemouth get us back underway after the break.
A slight pause as Solanke goes down following a collision. The Bournemouth striker is back up on his feet, though and good to continue.
Scott whips in a good ball from the left side - looking for Tavernier - but Zouma makes the vital clearance.
West Ham appear to have moved to a narrow diamond in midfield since the break. They will surely be hoping to get Ward-Prowse more involved in open play after he struggled out on the left in the first half.
The home side win a free-kick on the left side in a promising position. There's a lovely arc on Ward-Prowse's cross into the box but Soucek struggles to direct his header on target as it flies wide.
Johnson's cross is cleared only as far as Alvarez but his strike from the edge of the box clatters its way through to Neto who makes a comfortable save.
The home fans are incensed as Kudus goes down inside the area. The winger had the beating of Kelly before going down inside the box but the referee waves the protests away. VAR is taking a look, however.
The referee Tim Robinson is told to head to the monitor. It did appear that Kelly clipped the heel of Kudus on replay.
PENALTY! The referee changes his decision and West Ham will have a penalty and a chance to level up this game.
GOOOAAAALLL!! WEST HAM EQUALISE! 1-1! Neto dives to his right but Ward-Prowse smashes it down the middle and the home side are level.
Kelly, who conceded the West Ham penalty, almost redeems himself as he makes a surging, overlapping run down the left. His cross is looking for Solanke in the middle but Areola does well to parry it out for a corner.
Scott's corner is aimed towards the far post but Zouma rises well to clear it away.
Christie is given too much space on the edge of the box but his clipped, left-footed effort just drifts past the right post.
Kudus is causing real problems down his West Ham right. He draws another foul and this time Christie is shown the game's first yellow card.

The corner is whipped in but it's a poor delivery which is headed away easily at the front post.
Both sides are giving it a real go in the final few minutes in search of what would surely be a winning goal. Will either side make the breakthrough?
There will be eight minutes of added time to end this second half.
A late change for Bournemouth as Tavernier makes way for Faivre who makes his first start since returning from his loan spell at Lorient.
Bournemouth aren't hurrying in these final few moments as Smith and Solanke run down the clock in the right corner of the pitch. Perhaps the away side are more than happy with a point at this stage.
The away side work the ball patiently as they look for one final chance but Smith's eventual cross from the right is wildly overhit and flies out for a throw-in.
A late change for the home side as Kudus is replaced by Cornet for the final minutes.
Faivre is shown a late yellow for timewasting.
FULL-TIME: WEST HAM 1-1 BOURNEMOUTH
A sluggish West Ham were held to a 1-1 draw at home against Bournemouth as David Moyes' side missed out on the chance to put pressure on Aston Villa in fifth place. The home side got off to the worst possible start as Dominic Solanke fired home after just three minutes when debutant Kalvin Phillips was caught in possession. Antoine Semenyo missed a golden opportunity to double the Cherries' lead but saw his effort saved by Alphonse Areola. It was a game of few chances in the second half but the Hammers took their one clear chance when a VAR check afforded James Ward-Prowse the chance to slam home from the penalty spot after Lloyd Kelly brought down Mohammed Kudus in the area. The Hammers remain in sixth, while Bournemouth's winless run against West Ham extends to six games. Next up for Moyes' side is a tricky visit to face Manchester United, while Bournemouth host Nottingham Forest. That's all for today - thanks for tuning in!"	"Phil Foden produced an outstanding display as his hat-trick put Manchester City two points off league leaders Liverpool as the champions came from behind to win 3-1 at Brentford.
Neal Maupay gave Brentford a surprise lead but Foden equalised just before half-time and he then added his second and third in the second half to claim the match ball.
How the match unfolded
Brentford made one change from their defeat to Tottenham Hotspur last Wednesday with Sergio Reguilon coming in for Keane Lewis-Potter.
The big news for Man City was the return of Erling Haaland, who was making his first start since a 1-0 loss against Aston Villa on 6 December. Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias and Bernardo Silva also returned to the side.
City started the match in control, with Mark Flekken called into action early as he denied two long-range strikes from Julian Alvarez and another from Walker.
However, it was Brentford who took a surprise lead in the 21st minute through Maupay as the French striker raced through on goal before calmly slotting the ball into the bottom-left corner.
Ivan Toney played a large part in the goal, as he held off Nathan Ake, but the official assist went to Mark Flekken, who becomes the first goalkeeper to record an assist in the Premier League since April 2023, when Brighton’s Jason Steele provided a goal against Brentford.
It is also a goal in a fifth consecutive appearance for Maupay in all competitions, his longest-ever scoring run for an English side.
Haaland then had a brilliant chance to equalise moments later when a poor backpass from Vitaly Janelt put him through on goal, but Flekken made another great save to keep Man City out.
Flekken was in inspired form in the first half, making nine saves, the most by any goalkeeper in a opening period since records began, but the visitors scored just before the break through Foden following a mistake from Ethan Pinnock as his header fell kindly to the City player, who finished past the goalkeeper.
Foden followed up his late goal in the first half with an early one in the second period as he got on the end of Kevin De Bruyne's cross and headed it past Flekken.
Brentford pushed for an equaliser, with Maupay, Toney and Christian Norgaard all going close, but they were unable to find their second goal.
Foden then completed his hat-trick and secured the win for Man City with 20 minutes to go as he finished off a well-worked move, assisted by Haaland.
Foden's third strike also meant it was a record number for goals in a single Matchweek, with 45 being scored across the 10 Premier League fixtures over the weekend.
Pep Guardiola's side ended the contest in comfortable fashion as they secure a fifth win in a row to move on to 49 points, two behind Liverpool, who have played a match more. 
Brentford, who have lost seven of their last eight matches, remain in 15th on 22 points, three points above 18th-place Everton.

Match officials"	Team_4	Team_13	"[""Hello and welcome to this live commentary for the Premier League fixture between Team_19 and Team_3 live from the London Stadium.\nAfter falling to a disappointing late draw against Team_17, Team_19 enjoyed a much-needed time to reset with the Hammers not in FA Cup fourth-round action last weekend. David Moyes' side will be looking for an immediate reaction, though, having failed to win any of their last four games prior to today. It's been a busy day of outgoings in the transfer market but those fans travelling to the London Stadium tonight will be keen to see three points from those still in the squad as their side look to put pressure on Team_2 in fifth following their defeat to Team_15 on Tuesday.\nTeam_3, meanwhile, will be heading into this fixture full of confidence after their comprehensive 5-0 win against Swansea in the FA Cup fifth round last Thursday. The Cherries, however, have lost their last two Premier League games and are winless against the Hammers in their last five games (D2, L3). A win tonight would move\xa0Andoni Iraola's side above Team_10 and into 12th after the Cottagers drew 0-0 with Team_9 on Tuesday.\nTeam_19 (4-3-2-1): Alphonse Areola; Ben Johnson, Konstantinos Mavropanos, Kurt Zouma, Emerson; Kalvin Phillips, Tomas Soucek, Edson Alvarez; Mohammed Kudus, James Ward-Prowse; Jarrod Bowen.\nTeam_19 SUBS: Lukasz Fabianski, Divin Mubama, Angelo Ogbonna, Kaelan Casey, Aaron Cresswell, Lewis Orford, Oliver Scarles, Danny Ings, Maxwel Cornet.\nTeam_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Adam Smith, Illia Zabarnyi, Marcos Senesi, Lloyd Kelly; Lewis Cook, Ryan Christie; Antoine Semenyo, Adam Scott, Marcus Tavernier; Dominic Solanke.\nTeam_3 SUBS: Mark Travers, Philip Billing, Max Kinsey-Wellings, Luis Sinisterra, Chris Mepham, Gavin Kilkenny, Milos Kerkez, Justin Kluivert, Romain Faivre.\nDavid Moyes makes four changes to his Team_19 side that drew 2-2 against Team_17 last time out. Vladimir Coufal is suspended after picking up a red card and so Ben Johnson comes in at right-back. Further forward, both Cornet and Ings drop to the bench, while Pablo Fornals misses out altogether, with the Spaniard closing in on a deadline-day move to Real Betis. In their place, there is a first start for new signing Kalvin Phillips after joining on loan from Team_13, while Alvarez and Kudus return from injury and the Africa Cup of Nations respectively.\nAndoni Iraola, meanwhile, also names four changes from Team_3 5-0 win FA Cup win against Swansea. Neto and Smith return in goal and defence to replace Travers and James Hill. Further forward, Tavernier is preferred to\xa0Sinisterra, while David Brooks is replaced by Semenyo, with the Welshman having recently completed a loan move to Championship side Southampton.\nTeam_19 have kept a clean sheet in each of their last three Premier League home games. The last time they achieved four in a row came\xa0between December and January in 2009-10 under Gianfranco Zola.\nKICK-OFF! Team_19 get us underway here in London for the first half.\nGOAAALLL!! Team_3 LEAD! 1-0! What a nightmare start in a Team_19 shirt for Phillips. The Englishman is caught in possession on the edge of his box and, under pressure from Christie, gifts the ball to Solanke who slots home past Areola. The goal was initially ruled out for offside but the final touch came off the Team_19 midfielder so the goal stands.\nOVER! Team_19 still haven't woken up here as Team_3 almost have a second. A free-kick is swung in from the left and Senesi fires just over the bar as he strikes the loose ball at the first time of asking.\nThat's just the third time that Team_19 have conceded a first-half goal at home this season. Not the start that Moyes would have been after from his men.\nTeam_3 continue to press high up the pitch and force Areola to go long with the kick. Bowen is leading the line tonight but he hasn't got the aerial presence to outmuscle the Team_3 central defenders.\nMoyes is cutting an animated figure on the sideline as he barks orders at his Team_19 players. Smith deflects Bowen's corner behind as Team_19 win their first corner of the game.\nWard-Prowse swings in the corner to the front post but the delivery is unusually poor from the Englishman and Team_3 win a goal-kick.\nKudus does well to hassle Kelly off the ball down the left side but Bowen eventually loses the ball on the edge of the box. Team_3 break before Cook's long-range effort has Areola worried for a moment but the effort sails well wide of the target.\nTavernier feeds Semenyo and it's a great little run from the winger to get himself into the box. His eventual left-footed effort takes a deflection off Mavropanos but goes out for a corner. The corner is whipped in by Scott but Areola clings on after it flicks off Solanke's arm.\nTeam_19 have not clicked into gear so far this match, with the home side registering just one shot so far this game.\nAnother well-worked move from Team_3 as Mavropanos heads Scott's fierce cross behind for another corner.\nScott delivers his ball to the near post but Christie's looping header goes comfortably over the bar.\nSoucek pulls back Cook in the middle of the park to give away another foul. That's greeted by more groans from the home fans in attendance who are less than impressed with the start their side have made to this contest.\nDominic Solanke has now scored 13\xa0Premier League goals this season – only Joshua King in 2016-17 (16) and Callum Wilson in 2018-19 (14) have scored more in a single top-flight campaign for Team_3.\nWard-Prowse is really struggling out on this left flank. The midfielder has had just ten touches of the ball so far this game, the joint-fewest of any Team_19 player so far.\nA lovely defence-splitting pass from Cook plays Tavernier down the right side of the box. The winger tries to cut the ball towards Solanke but Team_19 clear the threat away.\nTeam_19 line up a long throw-in but it's a poor delivery from the centre-back which gets nowhere near the penalty area. That sums up Team_19 first half so far. The home side do win a free-kick shortly after but Ward-Prowse's delivery is cleared away.\nBowen is having to drop deep to get on the ball which isn't an ideal position for the Team_19 centre forward. The Englishman gives the ball away cheaply but Semenyo can't make anything stick with his surging run down the right flank.\nSAVE! A huge save from Areola to keep the home side in it. Again, Team_19 are dispossessed in the middle of the park and Solanke has the ball inside the box in an instant. He shifts it to Semenyo who should score but blasts his effort straight at Areola who makes the vital stop. That should be 2-0.\nA superb delivery into the box from Ward-Prowse as he finally gets into an advanced position down the left side. Bowen throws himself at the cross but can't make contact with the header and Neto is able to push the ball away.\nBetter now from Team_19 as Kudus makes a good run to the byline. His cross reaches the onrushing Soucek but the midfielder can't control his header and it's well over the bar from the Czech international.\nA lovely turn from Kudus gives Johnson plenty of space on the right side to whip in a cross. His delivery, though, is poor and goes behind the three Team_19 players queuing up in the box.\nIt's been a far better end to the half for the home side who have enjoyed 80 per cent of the ball in these last five minutes.\nTavernier forces a good save from Areola but the flag goes up on Solanke who was offside in the build-up.\nInto the first of two minutes of first-half added time we go.\nAnother good chance for the Cherries on the stroke of half-time. A lovely pass from Christie opens up the pitch as Solankes surges forward. He slides through Semenyo but his left-footed effort is deflected over the bar for a corner.\nHALF-TIME: Team_19 0-1 Team_3\nTeam_19 trail 1-0 at the break against Team_3 after Dominic Solanke notched up his 13th goal of the Premier League season. The Cherries striker has been in fine form this season and took just three minutes to add to his tally at the London Stadium, firing home after debutant Kalvin Phillips was caught in possession. The away side should really be two goals to the good but for Alphonse Areola's smart save to deny Antoine Semenyo's well-struck effort. Team_19 grew into the game as the half wore on but they still have plenty of work to do after the break to pull this one back.\nMoyes should be pleased with how his side ended the first half but they will need to keep that level up for the entirety of the second half. In particular, the Hammers were very sloppy in midfield and often found themselves caught out by Team_3 press.\nKICK-OFF! Team_3 get us back underway after the break.\nA slight pause as Solanke goes down following a collision. The Team_3 striker is back up on his feet, though and good to continue.\nScott whips in a good ball from the left side - looking for Tavernier - but Zouma makes the vital clearance.\nTeam_19 appear to have moved to a narrow diamond in midfield since the break. They will surely be hoping to get Ward-Prowse more involved in open play after he struggled out on the left in the first half.\nThe home side win a free-kick on the left side in a promising position. There's a lovely arc on Ward-Prowse's cross into the box but Soucek struggles to direct his header on target as it flies wide.\nJohnson's cross is cleared only as far as Alvarez but his strike from the edge of the box clatters its way through to Neto who makes a comfortable save.\nThe home fans are incensed as Kudus goes down inside the area. The winger had the beating of Kelly before going down inside the box but the referee waves the protests away. VAR is taking a look, however.\nThe referee Tim Robinson is told to head to the monitor. It did appear that Kelly clipped the heel of Kudus on replay.\nPENALTY! The referee changes his decision and Team_19 will have a penalty and a chance to level up this game.\nGOOOAAAALLL!! Team_19 EQUALISE! 1-1! Neto dives to his right but Ward-Prowse smashes it down the middle and the home side are level.\nKelly, who conceded the Team_19 penalty, almost redeems himself as he makes a surging, overlapping run down the left. His cross is looking for Solanke in the middle but Areola does well to parry it out for a corner.\nScott's corner is aimed towards the far post but Zouma rises well to clear it away.\nChristie is given too much space on the edge of the box but his clipped, left-footed effort just drifts past the right post.\nKudus is causing real problems down his Team_19 right. He draws another foul and this time Christie is shown the game's first yellow card.\nWard-Prowse whips the cross towards the back post but Bowen is unable to direct his header on target through a crowd of players.\nTeam_3 make a double change as Semenyo departs for Sinisterra.\nScott also makes way, with Kluivert replacing him.\nTeam_19 also make a change as Phillips departs after a mixed debut.

93626	West Ham	Spurs	2024-04-02	London Stadium, London	62469.0	John Brooks	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Liverpool and Brighton at Anfield.
This could be a pivotal weekend in the title race, with leaders Arsenal set to take on third-placed Manchester City later on Sunday. Ahead of that game, though, Liverpool will bid to keep their own title charge on course with victory at a ground where they are so strong, winning 11 of their 14 games at Anfield in this season's Premier League and yet to taste defeat on home soil, the best record in the division. Prior to the international break, however, Liverpool suffered late heartbreak away at rivals Manchester United in the FA Cup as Amad Diallo's extra-time winner condemned the Reds to a 4-3 defeat.
Brighton's European charge has been dented somewhat by recent struggles in the league, winning just three of their last nine Premier League outings to leave them in ninth heading into this one, six points behind sixth-placed United. However, a shock win here would see the Seagulls leapfrog West Ham into seventh, and that should provide the motivation needed to bounce back from crashing out of the Europa League after defeat over two legs against Roma before the international pause.
LIVERPOOL (4-3-3): Caoimhin Kelleher; Conor Bradley, Virgil van Dijk, Jarell Quansah, Joe Gomez; Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo, Alexis Mac Allister; Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz.
SUBS: Cody Gakpo, Ryan Gravenberch, Harvey Elliott, Adrian, James McConnell, Bobby Clark, Jayden Danns, Ibrahima Konate, Konstantinos Tsimikas.
BRIGHTON (3-4-3): Bart Verbruggen; Joel Veltman, Lewis Dunk, Jan-Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Pascal Gross, Carlos Baleba, Pervis Estupinan; Simon Adingra, Danny Welbeck, Jakub Moder.
SUBS: Igor Julio, Adam Webster, Adam Lallana, Valentin Barco, Jason Steele, Evan Ferguson, Ansu Fati, Facundo Buonanotte, Samy Chouchane.
Jurgen Klopp makes one change from the cup defeat to United. It's an enforced one as Andrew Robertson misses out after picking up an ankle knock while on international duty with Scotland. Bradley comes in as Gomez slides across to left-back, while Curtis Jones is absent from the squad.
Roberto De Zerbi goes with three alterations from the second leg with Roma as Moder, Veltman and Baleba come in. Lallana drops to the bench, while Billy Gilmour and Julio Enciso are missing from the squad. Welbeck gets the nod up front for his 100th Premier League appearance for the Seagulls.
The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of a big game for their respective Premier League ambitions. Who will collect the three points? We will find out shortly!
The visitors kick us off and we are under way at Anfield!
GOOOAAALLL!!! WHAT A START FOR BRIGHTON!!! On his 100th Premier League appearance for the Seagulls, Welbeck has blasted De Zerbi's men in front at Anfield! Liverpool give possession away and Brighton pounce. Adingra brings it forward before the ball is worked into the box, where it sits up nicely for Welbeck to smash goalwards. His powerful effort gives Kelleher absolutely no chance, and Brighton lead 1-0!
Welbeck has marked his milestone game with a goal, becoming just the fourth English player to reach 100 Premier League appearances for Brighton after Dunk, Solly March and Adam Webster.
This is a day that could have major ramifications in the Premier League's title race, and the first goal of it certainly hasn't gone the way you'd have expected. It's crucial Liverpool find a response, though they have plenty of time to find one.
The hosts are getting the ball into dangerous areas but are yet to really threaten. Brighton have largely sat back since going ahead, a dangerous ploy against a side of Liverpool's caliber.
WIDE! As he has done so often for Liverpool, Salah looks to cut onto his left foot and bend a finish into the top corner. This time, however, his effort just doesn't quite curl enough, and the ball flies past the left post.
Welbeck's goal was the earliest a visiting side has gone 1-0 up at Anfield in the Premier League since Tottenham did so in October 2019 (Harry Kane after 47 seconds).
Mac Allister's eyes light up as the balls falls kindly for him to hit and try and score against his old club. However, his former team-mates breathe a sigh of relief as the midfielder's shot flies a couple of yards over the target.
Mac Allister receives the first booking of the game for sending Adingra tumbling to the turf on a Brighton counter. There didn't seem to be too much contact, and the referee certainly hesitated before eventually deciding to blow up and card Mac Allister.
Liverpool are dominating the ball, but Brighton are continuing to look threatening on the counter. The hosts will have to be wary of that, as going 2-0 down would be a huge problem.
CHANCE! Mac Allister picks out a brilliant lofted ball to pick out Salah in the box. Nunez is waiting in the middle, but Salah decides to go for goal himself, and his first-time left-footed volley flies over the crossbar. That was a big opportunity for a player of Salah's quality.
Gross catches his former team-mate Mac Allister with a late challenge in midfield, receiving a yellow card for his troubles. The Argentina international has been left in a heap and looks in a bit of pain.
Much to the majority of Anfield's relief, Mac Allister is up and okay to continue. He has impressed so far in Liverpool's engine room.
After a frenzied opening, the game has just hit its first lull with the tempo slowing. Klopp will be wanting his team to ramp it up again as they look to put the visitors' lead under threat.
Having won each of their first six Premier League games against Brighton, Liverpool have now won just one of their last seven against them (four draws, two defeats).
GOOOAAALLL!!! DIAZ LEVELS FOR LIVERPOOL!!! A corner comes in from the right, and Brighton fail to fully deal with it with a poor clearing header. Salah nods the ball back into the danger area, where Veltman inadvertently nudges it into the path of Diaz. The Colombia international takes it first time, poking into the back of the net at full stretch to make it 1-1! Game on!
The crowd is really up for it now, and it's imperative Brighton don't concede again quickly or this game could get away from them. The Seagulls need half-time, though there's still a good 16 or so minutes until they will receive the sweet relief of the referee's whistle.
Brighton's response to seeing their lead eradicated has been impressive. They threaten down the left again, and the clever move ends with Welbeck blasting into the side-netting. They have certainly given the hosts some real warning signs at the back.
Persistent work from Bradley sees him win the ball back and stride into the Brighton box. He then lays the ball back for Diaz, but the winger can't find the back of the net for a second time as his tame shot is saved comfortably by Verbruggen.
Welbeck manages to get to a ball over the top and cut it back for Moder, but the recipient's shot is deflected over the crossbar and out for a corner, which then comes to nothing.
CLOSE AGAIN! A bizarre moment nearly puts Liverpool ahead as Nunez, on the floor after just seeing a header blocked, manages to swing a leg and flick the loose ball goalwards. It's nearly brilliant, but Nunez's inventive effort takes a nick off the inside of Verbruggen's left leg and deflects wide of the target.
Liverpool have won 23 points from losing positions this season, the highest in the Premier League. That resilience could stand them in good stead again here as they look to add three points to that tally.
As we close in on the break, the frantic pace at Anfield is showing no sign of slowing down. It's been a brilliant first half, and there could yet be more drama before the half-time whistle.
Of Diaz's 15 Premier League goals, 12 have come at Anfield. He has scored in four of his last five home matches in the competition.
We are into four minutes of additional time at the end of this lively first half.
Brighton are unbeaten in their last three away league games against Liverpool (one win, two draws), having only avoided defeat in two of their previous 11 visits to Anfield.
HALF-TIME: LIVERPOOL 1-1 BRIGHTON
The whistle blows to bring an intriguing first half to an end with the scoreline 1-1 at Anfield between Liverpool and Brighton. It was the visitors who took a shock lead within 87 seconds, as former United man Welbeck blasted a powerful finish past the helpless Kelleher to put the Seagulls ahead. Klopp's men responded, though, and after Salah twice went close, he played a key role in Liverpool's equaliser. The Egypt international nodded a loose Brighton clearance into the box, and after Veltman's skewed clearance fell to Diaz, the winger poked into the back of the net to ensure the Reds are on level terms at the interval.
It was a first half that Liverpool certainly had the better of, accumulating 1.24 xG (expected goals) to Brighton's 0.17, but the Seagulls got into some really threatening positions too, and looked potent on the counter. You'd expect the hosts to be the side pressing after the break, but don't rule out De Zerbi's men snatching the three points themselves.
The hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half.
Welbeck receives a yellow card for asking the referee to book Mac Allister following a foul on Baleba.
Van Dijk goes in the book now for hauling Baleba to the turf as Brighton looked to counter.
Brighton have focused one one wing in particular, with 62 per cent of their attacks in the opening 45 minutes coming down the left-hand side, while Adingra recorded the most dribbles of any player in the first half (four). Quansah and Bradley have certainly faced some problems.
CHANCE! Gomez whips a delightful cross into the box for Mac Allister. The midfielder, not known for his heading abilities, tries to nod into the bottom-right corner, but the ball skims off his head somewhat and bounces a couple of yards wide of the target.
Liverpool fans want a penalty as Salah goes down in the box under a challenge from Dunk, but the referee waves away the protests.
Baleba tries his luck with an ambitious effort from range, and it proves to be a very poor decision as he smashes high into the stands, never close to troubling Kelleher.
Gomez receives a blatant yellow card for wiping out Lamptey, who was looking to set his team away on a counter.
Half an hour left to play at Anfield, and as it stands, the hosts are dropping valuable points in the title race. There's no doubt they've been the better team, but they haven't yet converted that dominance into a second and potentially winning goal.
The Seagulls are camped in their own box at the moment, daring their hosts to break them down. They've defended pretty resolutely here, but there's plenty of work still to be done if they are to come away with a shock result.
Nunez cuts onto his right foot and smashes goalwards, but it's straight at Verbruggen, who manages to beat away as Liverpool continue to threaten.
GOOOAAALLL!!! WHAT A GOAL!!! It's a brilliant move that allows Salah to stroke home and make it 2-1! Szoboszlai fizzes a pass from out wide into Mac Allister, who takes a touch before quickly laying into the path of Salah. The winger brings the ball under his spell, before coolly placing a superb left-footed finish past Verbruggen and into the bottom-left corner to put Liverpool into the lead at Anfield!
Mac Allister has impressed here, and he superbly controlled Szoboszlai's pass before teeing up Salah to finish.
Salah has been directly involved in 15 Premier League goals against Brighton (nine goals, six assists), his most against a single opponent. He absolutely loves playing the Seagulls.
The first change of the contest comes from De Zerbi, who brings on Buonanotte for Lamptey.
GOOOAAALLL!!! Or is it??? Diaz thinks he has put Liverpool 3-1 up as he gets onto the end of Salah's perfectly weighted throughball, before his shot goes straight through Verbruggen. He wheels off to celebrate, but the flag goes up for offside to curtail the jubilant scenes. There will be a VAR check, however...
As we await the outcome of the VAR check to see whether Liverpool are 3-1 up, Van Hecke is booked for a foul in the build-up to Diaz's finish.
NO GOAL!!! It remains 2-1 as the linesman's decision to award offside is confirmed to be correct, with Diaz's 'goal' ruled out. There really wasn't much in it, though!
Liverpool charge forward on the counter, with Diaz laying it to his left for Salah. The Egypt international gets into the box, but his effort doesn't seriously trouble Verbruggen, who gets down low to make the save.
Mac Allister has now registered five Premier League assists for Liverpool (24 appearances) - as many as he had in his Brighton career in the competition (98 appearances).
Most of Brighton's threat in this game has been on the counter-attack. Now they have to be the side pressing, it'll be interesting to see if they can conjure up the same problems for Liverpool.
SAVE! Dunk gets up brilliantly to meet Gross' free-kick delivery into the box, and his header looks to be sneaking into the bottom corner, until Kelleher gets down to his left to tip past the post.
It's not been Nunez's most active game, and he is replaced by Elliott for these closing exchanges.
Adingra has caused Liverpool real problems here but now makes way for Ferguson, who will hope to give Brighton a bit more physical presence up top.
Lallana enters the fray against his former side for Moder.
Five minutes left at Anfield, and the visitors aren't exactly hammering the door down in their pursuit of an equaliser. In fact, it's the hosts who look the more likely to grab the fourth goal of this game and secure the three points.
CHANCE! Lallana nearly finds a leveller against his old club after he is picked out in the box, though his low shot dribbles a couple of yards wide of the left post. That would've been some story if he was the man to break Liverpool hearts!
Endo is yellow-carded for cynically pulling the marauding Van Hecke to the turf.
Having scored his side's leveller earlier on, Diaz is replaced by Gakpo.
WHAT A SAVE!!! Verbruggen makes an extraordinary stop to keep his side in the game! After a neat Liverpool move down the right, Salah pounces upon a loose ball in the Brighton box. He fires towards the bottom corner with the help of a deflection, but somehow, Verbruggen gets down to his right to get a strong hand to the attempt and ensure his team still has a chance of a result.
We are well into six minutes of additional time at the end of this game. It's nervy at Anfield now!
Barco joins the action for the closing stages, on in place of Estupinan.
As Klopp looks to see the game out, he brings on Gravenberch for Szoboszlai.
Salah tries to kill the game off by catching Verbruggen out at his near post, but the winger drags his effort wide right of the target.
Gakpo now sees yellow for pulling back Veltman.
FULL-TIME: LIVERPOOL 2-1 BRIGHTON
The full-time whistle brings sighs of relief around Anfield as Liverpool run out 2-1 winners over Brighton to move top of the Premier League, at least until City take on Arsenal later on Sunday. The Reds found themselves behind after just 87 seconds, Welbeck firing past Kelleher and in to stun Anfield. The hosts would respond, though, levelling through Diaz, before a clever move unlocked the Brighton door again in the second half for Salah to finish. There were a few nervy moments late on for the home crowd, but their team held on to secure another huge three points that move them top and with a three-point lead, at least temporarily. For the Seagulls, they remain ninth having seen their European hopes take another blow. They will look to get back on track when they travel to Brentford on Wednesday, while Liverpool host struggling Sheffield United the following day. That is all we have for you from Anfield, so thanks for your company and goodbye!"	"Tottenham Hotspur missed the chance to move level with Aston Villa in the top-four race as they were held to a 1-1 draw at West Ham United in a London derby.
Brennan Johnson fired Spurs in front on five minutes, but Kurt Zouma’s equaliser soon after ultimately proved enough to earn the Hammers a point. 
Spurs remain fifth with 57 points. West Ham, who are winless in their last four matches, stay seventh on 45 points. 
Ange Postecoglou’s Spurs side, who had come from behind to beat Luton Town 2-1 on Saturday, were quick out of the blocks. 
They went in front after a swift exchange of neat passes down West Ham’s right culminated in Timo Werner crossing for Johnson to tuck home from close range. 
The Hammers have now conceded 55 league goals this season, the same amount as they let in throughout the entire 2022/23 campaign. 
Pedro Porro and Son Heung-min went close to doubling Spurs’ lead, but the visitors were pegged back in the 19th minute as Jarrod Bowen’s corner went in off Zouma's back as he attempted a header. 
Zouma has now scored 11 Premier League goals in the last four seasons, with Arsenal’s Gabriel the only defender to find the net more often during that time, scoring 14 times.
West Ham began the second half strongly as they looked to complete the turnaround, with Guglielmo Vicario producing reflex saves to deny Michail Antonio and Konstantinos Mavropanos. 
Antonio then squandered a marvellous opportunity on the hour. Having outmuscled Micky van de Ven to latch onto a long ball, the Jamaica international fired straight at Vicario. 
Lukasz Fabianski was grateful to see Destiny Udogie’s strike in the fourth minute of stoppage time sail into his grasp in an end-to-end finale, as both sides had to settle for a point.

Team_19		"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_11 and Team_5 at Anfield.\nThis could be a pivotal weekend in the title race, with leaders Team_1 set to take on third-placed Team_13 later on Sunday. Ahead of that game, though, Team_11 will bid to keep their own title charge on course with victory at a ground where they are so strong, winning 11 of their 14 games at Anfield in this season's Premier League and yet to taste defeat on home soil, the best record in the division. Prior to the international break, however, Team_11 suffered late heartbreak away at rivals Team_14 in the FA Cup as Amad Diallo's extra-time winner condemned the Reds to a 4-3 defeat.\nTeam_5 European charge has been dented somewhat by recent struggles in the league, winning just three of their last nine Premier League outings to leave them in ninth heading into this one, six points behind sixth-placed United. However, a shock win here would see the Seagulls leapfrog Team_19 into seventh, and that should provide the motivation needed to bounce back from crashing out of the Europa League after defeat over two legs against Roma before the international pause.\nTeam_11 (4-3-3): Caoimhin Kelleher; Conor Bradley, Virgil van Dijk, Jarell Quansah, Joe Gomez; Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo, Alexis Mac Allister; Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz.\nSUBS: Cody Gakpo, Ryan Gravenberch, Harvey Elliott, Adrian, James McConnell, Bobby Clark, Jayden Danns, Ibrahima Konate, Konstantinos Tsimikas.\nTeam_5 (3-4-3): Bart Verbruggen; Joel Veltman, Lewis Dunk, Jan-Paul van Hecke; Tariq Lamptey, Pascal Gross, Carlos Baleba, Pervis Estupinan; Simon Adingra, Danny Welbeck, Jakub Moder.\nSUBS: Igor Julio, Adam Webster, Adam Lallana, Valentin Barco, Jason Steele, Evan Ferguson, Ansu Fati, Facundo Buonanotte, Samy Chouchane.\nJurgen Klopp makes one change from the cup defeat to United. It's an enforced one as Andrew Robertson misses out after picking up an ankle knock while on international duty with Scotland. Bradley comes in as Gomez slides across to left-back, while Curtis Jones is absent from the squad.\nRoberto De Zerbi goes with three alterations from the second leg with Roma as Moder, Veltman and Baleba come in. Lallana drops to the bench, while Billy Gilmour and Julio Enciso are missing from the squad. Welbeck gets the nod up front for his 100th Premier League appearance for the Seagulls.\nThe two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of a big game for their respective Premier League ambitions. Who will collect the three points? We will find out shortly!\nThe visitors kick us off and we are under way at Anfield!\nGOOOAAALLL!!! WHAT A START FOR Team_5!!! On his 100th Premier League appearance for the Seagulls, Welbeck has blasted De Zerbi's men in front at Anfield! Team_11 give possession away and Team_5 pounce. Adingra brings it forward before the ball is worked into the box, where it sits up nicely for Welbeck to smash goalwards. His powerful effort gives Kelleher absolutely no chance, and Team_5 lead 1-0!\nWelbeck has marked his milestone game with a goal, becoming just the fourth English player to reach 100 Premier League appearances for Team_5 after Dunk, Solly March and Adam Webster.\nThis is a day that could have major ramifications in the Premier League's title race, and the first goal of it certainly hasn't gone the way you'd have expected. It's crucial Team_11 find a response, though they have plenty of time to find one.\nThe hosts are getting the ball into dangerous areas but are yet to really threaten. Team_5 have largely sat back since going ahead, a dangerous ploy against a side of Team_11 caliber.\nWIDE! As he has done so often for Team_11, Salah looks to cut onto his left foot and bend a finish into the top corner. This time, however, his effort just doesn't quite curl enough, and the ball flies past the left post.\nWelbeck's goal was the earliest a visiting side has gone 1-0 up at Anfield in the Premier League since Team_18 did so in October 2019 (Harry Kane after 47 seconds).\nMac Allister's eyes light up as the balls falls kindly for him to hit and try and score against his old club. However, his former team-mates breathe a sigh of relief as the midfielder's shot flies a couple of yards over the target.\nMac Allister receives the first booking of the game for sending Adingra tumbling to the turf on a Team_5 counter. There didn't seem to be too much contact, and the referee certainly hesitated before eventually deciding to blow up and card Mac Allister.\nTeam_11 are dominating the ball, but Team_5 are continuing to look threatening on the counter. The hosts will have to be wary of that, as going 2-0 down would be a huge problem.\nCHANCE! Mac Allister picks out a brilliant lofted ball to pick out Salah in the box. Nunez is waiting in the middle, but Salah decides to go for goal himself, and his first-time left-footed volley flies over the crossbar. That was a big opportunity for a player of Salah's quality.\nGross catches his former team-mate Mac Allister with a late challenge in midfield, receiving a yellow card for his troubles. The Argentina international has been left in a heap and looks in a bit of pain.\nMuch to the majority of Anfield's relief, Mac Allister is up and okay to continue. He has impressed so far in Team_11 engine room.\nAfter a frenzied opening, the game has just hit its first lull with the tempo slowing. Klopp will be wanting his team to ramp it up again as they look to put the visitors' lead under threat.\nHaving won each of their first six Premier League games against Team_5, Team_11 have now won just one of their last seven against them (four draws, two defeats).\nGOOOAAALLL!!! DIAZ LEVELS FOR Team_11!!! A corner comes in from the right, and Team_5 fail to fully deal with it with a poor clearing header. Salah nods the ball back into the danger area, where Veltman inadvertently nudges it into the path of Diaz. The Colombia international takes it first time, poking into the back of the net at full stretch to make it 1-1! Game on!\nThe crowd is really up for it now, and it's imperative Team_5 don't concede again quickly or this game could get away from them. The Seagulls need half-time, though there's still a good 16 or so minutes until they will receive the sweet relief of the referee's whistle.\nTeam_5 response to seeing their lead eradicated has been impressive. They threaten down the left again, and the clever move ends with Welbeck blasting into the side-netting. They have certainly given the hosts some real warning signs at the back.\nPersistent work from Bradley sees him win the ball back and stride into the Team_5 box. He then lays the ball back for Diaz, but the winger can't find the back of the net for a second time as his tame shot is saved comfortably by Verbruggen.\nWelbeck manages to get to a ball over the top and cut it back for Moder, but the recipient's shot is deflected over the crossbar and out for a corner, which then comes to nothing.\nCLOSE AGAIN! A bizarre moment nearly puts Team_11 ahead as Nunez, on the floor after just seeing a header blocked, manages to swing a leg and flick the loose ball goalwards. It's nearly brilliant, but Nunez's inventive effort takes a nick off the inside of Verbruggen's left leg and deflects wide of the target.\nTeam_11 have won 23 points from losing positions this season, the highest in the Premier League. That resilience could stand them in good stead again here as they look to add three points to that tally.\nAs we close in on the break, the frantic pace at Anfield is showing no sign of slowing down. It's been a brilliant first half, and there could yet be more drama before the half-time whistle.\nOf Diaz's 15 Premier League goals, 12 have come at Anfield. He has scored in four of his last five home matches in the competition.\nWe are into four minutes of additional time at the end of this lively first half.\nTeam_5 are unbeaten in their last three away league games against Team_11 (one win, two draws), having only avoided defeat in two of their previous 11 visits to Anfield.\nHALF-TIME: Team_11 1-1 Team_5\nThe whistle blows to bring an intriguing first half to an end with the scoreline 1-1 at Anfield between Team_11 and Team_5. It was the visitors who took a shock lead within 87 seconds, as former United man Welbeck blasted a powerful finish past the helpless Kelleher to put the Seagulls ahead. Klopp's men responded, though, and after Salah twice went close, he played a key role in Team_11 equaliser. The Egypt international nodded a loose Team_5 clearance into the box, and after Veltman's skewed clearance fell to Diaz, the winger poked into the back of the net to ensure the Reds are on level terms at the interval.\nIt was a first half that Team_11 certainly had the better of, accumulating 1.24 xG (expected goals) to Team_5 0.17, but the Seagulls got into some really threatening positions too, and looked potent on the counter. You'd expect the hosts to be the side pressing after the break, but don't rule out De Zerbi's men snatching the three points themselves.\nThe hosts get the ball rolling again for the second half.\nWelbeck receives a yellow card for asking the referee to book Mac Allister following a foul on Baleba.\nVan Dijk goes in the book now for hauling Baleba to the turf as Team_5 looked to counter.\nTeam_5 have focused one one wing in particular, with 62 per cent of their attacks in the opening 45 minutes coming down the left-hand side, while Adingra recorded the most dribbles of any player in the first half (four). Quansah and Bradley have certainly faced some problems.\nCHANCE! Gomez whips a delightful cross into the box for Mac Allister. The midfielder, not known for his heading abilities, tries to nod into the bottom-right corner, but the ball skims off his head somewhat and bounces a couple of yards wide of the target.\nTeam_11 fans want a penalty as Salah goes down in the box under a challenge from Dunk, but the referee waves away the protests.\nBaleba tries his luck with an ambitious effort from range, and it proves to be a very poor decision as he smashes high into the stands, never close to troubling Kelleher.\nGomez receives a blatant yellow card for wiping out Lamptey, who was looking to set his team away on a counter.\nHalf an hour left to play at Anfield, and as it stands, the hosts are dropping valuable points in the title race. There's no doubt they've been the better team, but they haven't yet converted that dominance into a second and potentially winning goal.\nThe Seagulls are camped in their own box at the moment, daring their hosts to break them down. They've defended pretty resolutely here, but there's plenty of work still to be done if they are to come away with a shock result.\nNunez cuts onto his right foot and smashes goalwards, but it's straight at Verbruggen, who manages to beat away as Team_11 continue to threaten.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! WHAT A GOAL!!! It's a brilliant move that allows Salah to stroke home and make it 2-1! Szoboszlai fizzes a pass from out wide into Mac Allister, who takes a touch before quickly laying into the path of Salah. The winger brings the ball under his spell, before coolly placing a superb left-footed finish past Verbruggen and into the bottom-left corner to put Team_11 into the lead at Anfield!\nMac Allister has impressed here, and he superbly controlled Szoboszlai's pass before teeing up Salah to finish.\nSalah has been directly involved in 15 Premier League goals against Team_5 (nine goals, six assists), his most against a single opponent.\xa0He absolutely loves playing the Seagulls.\nThe first change of the contest comes from De Zerbi, who brings on Buonanotte for Lamptey.\nGOOOAAALLL!!! Or is it??? Diaz thinks he has put Team_11 3-1 up as he gets onto the end of Salah's perfectly weighted throughball, before his shot goes straight through Verbruggen. He wheels off to celebrate, but the flag goes up for offside to curtail the jubilant scenes. There will be a VAR check, however...\nAs we await the outcome of the VAR check to see whether Team_11 are 3-1 up, Van Hecke is booked for a foul in the build-up to Diaz's finish.\nNO GOAL!!! It remains 2-1 as the linesman's decision to award offside is confirmed to be correct, with Diaz's 'goal' ruled out. There really wasn't much in it, though!\nTeam_11 charge forward on the counter, with Diaz laying it to his left for Salah.

93614	Chelsea	Burnley	2024-03-30	Stamford Bridge, London	39535.0	Darren England	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Manchester United and Everton at Old Trafford.
United manager Erik ten Hag is under increased pressure after back-to-back defeats in the Premier League have seen his side slip 11 points behind fourth-placed Aston Villa and a guaranteed place in next season's Champions League. The Red Devils had strung four consecutive top-flight wins together in February to put them in a strong position, but defeats to Fulham and Manchester City have seen them drop to sixth place. United looked like they were on for a shock victory in the derby when Marcus Rashford gave them the lead with a thunderous strike heading into half-time. However, a brace from Phil Foden and a goal from Erling Haaland gave the Citizens a deserved victory, beating them 3.33-0.25 on xG (expected goals). As Aston Villa and Tottenham play against each other tomorrow, one of United's rivals for a Champions League spot will certainly drop points, but it will only matter if the hosts win today.
Everton were handed a boost before their last Premier League outing against West Ham, with their appeal to reduce their 10-point punishment for breaching Profit and Sustainability Rules to six points lifting them from 17th to 15th. As a result, the Toffees moved five points clear of the relegation zone. However, their disappointing run in the top-flight continued, with the Hammers' stoppage-time victory extending Everton's winless run to 10 games. They also had the lead at half-time after Beto made up for his penalty miss by scoring a header, but goals from Kurt Zouma, Tomas Soucek and Edson Alvarez helped David Moyes' men to all three points at Goodison Park. There is another possible points deduction for Everton looming, so an upturn in results is desperately needed for Sean Dyche to push them well away from the drop zone.
MANCHESTER UNITED (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof; Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro; Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho; Marcus Rashford.
MANCHESTER UNITED SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Antony, Dermot Mee, Willy Kambwala, Toby Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye.
EVERTON (4-5-1): Jordan Pickford; Ben Godfrey, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Jack Harrison, Amadou Onana, Abdoulaye Doucoure, James Garner, Dwight McNeil; Beto.
EVERTON SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Joao Virginia, Ashley Young, Andre Gomes, Seamus Coleman, Youssef Chermiti, Lewis Dobbin.
United select the same side that started their 3-1 defeat to rivals City in their previous Premier League outing. Evans and Rashford were forced off with injuries against the Citizens but are fit enough to keep their place in the team. Youngsters Collyer and Ogunneye are on the bench and could make their top-flight debut for the Red Devils.
Dyche also keeps the faith in his side that were beaten 3-1 by West Ham in their last match. There was a chance that Idrissa Gueye could’ve been fit enough to feature, but he hasn’t recovered from a groin injury and is out of the squad.
United have won all three of their Premier League games against Everton since the start of last season, while they last won four league meetings in a row against the Toffees from November 2006 to December 2007. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.
United get this Premier League clash under way. Fernandes has the first kick. Both teams desperately need a win.
United are put under pressure by Everton's early pressure in their defensive third, but Beto's low cross is blocked. The ball bobbles around the box, and neither side can take control, but the Red Devils eventually win it back.
McNeil wins an early corner on the left, with Garner strolling over to take it. However, his inswinging cross is headed away by Evans.
McNeil swings a deep cross from the left into the box, with Amadou Onana attacking it. The ball drops to Godfrey, who attempts to flick a shot at goal, but Andre Onana rushes off his line bravely to smother it.
Fernandes collects possession in the middle of Everton's half and offloads a pass to Garnacho on his right. He strides forward and rolls the ball into Dalot, but he takes a heavy touch inside the box, allowing Onana to clear it well away.
Everton are looking sharp, but it could be that United are also gifting them the ball too often. Beto slides a pass out to Doucoure on the right, but his cross is claimed by Onana, who dives across the box.
CHANCE! United go close out of nothing! Fernandes has the ball in United's half and switches the play over to Rashford, who darts down the left and into space. He gets past Mykolenko to get a shot away, but Harrison does brilliantly to get back and make an important block.
Fernandes takes the following corner from the right, swinging the ball onto Casemiro's header. However, his flicked effort is easily saved by Pickford.
PENALTY UNITED! The hosts have a chance to take the lead from the spot! Rashford comes down the left and slides a pass into Garnacho, who flicks the ball past Tarkowski and is tripped inside the box. There is a VAR check for offside, but the penalty stands!
GOALLLL! FERNANDES SCORES! 1-0 UNITED! What a penalty from Fernandes! The captain is cool under pressure, curling his penalty into the bottom-right corner. Pickford goes the right way, but he is beaten by the accuracy of the strike.
CHANCE! Everton almost responded immediately. The ball drops kindly to McNeil on the box, with the winger volleying a left-footed effort just wide of the left post. Onana could only stand and watch the ball go just wide.
There is a loud atmosphere at Old Trafford, which could be inspired by the recent news that new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new stadium. There has been some backlash, but all the home fans will set aside their concerns today and focus on supporting their side, looking to help United avoid defeat for the first time in three matches. Fernandes' goal came at the right time, with Everton building in confidence after a bright start.
Branthwaite has possession in Everton's half and looks to roll a throughball behind United's defence and into Beto, but the flag goes up for offside immediately. The striker was quite far off, as the play wasn't even allowed to continue to its conclusion.
Varane comes forward down the left and switches a pass over to Garnacho on the right. He is in space and cuts the ball into Fernandes in the middle of the box, but he scoops his first-time strike well over.
United regain possession on the halfway line, with McTominay ignoring Garnacho on the right and instead looking for Rashford on the left. However, he puts too much power on the ball, allowing Pickford to run off his line to claim it just inside the box.
Everton are getting shots away, but they are all coming from outside the box. This time, Harrison is given the time and space to crash a left-footed effort towards the goal, with his strike going well over the bar.
Beto wrestles for the ball against Evans on the halfway line, throwing his arm in the face of the centre-back. Everton's attack comes to nothing, but Evans isn’t happy with the striker. However, VAR sees no wrongdoing from the Portuguese forward.
Godfrey gets to the byline and flashes a cross into the box, but it goes just past Beto in the middle. Everton retain possession through McNeil, who looks for another cross. However, Varane shields it behind.
United gift the ball back to Everton again, but Mykolenko's strike from the edge is quickly blocked behind by Casemiro. Garner lifts his right-footed cross towards the back post, but Tarkowski cannot turn his header on target.
CHANCE! Another opportunity for Everton. Garner has space around him after playing a clever one-two outside United's box, but his strike is pushed away by Andre Onana. The goalkeeper pushes it straight out to Amadou Onana, who takes a touch before blasting his attempt well over.
Amadou Onana is the first player to be shown a yellow card after fouling Garnacho on the edge of the Everton box.
SAVE! Fernandes is denied his second goal. The captain takes responsibility for a free-kick just to the left outside the box and whips his right-footed effort towards the top-left corner. However, Pickford gets across his line to push it away at full stretch.
CHANCE! Wonderful play from United. Rashford has possession on the left and switches the play over to Fernandes on the right side of the box. He rolls it through to McTominay, who thumps a cutback towards Mainoo. However, Branthwaite slides it away before the flag goes up for offside.
Evans concedes possession in United's half to Beto, allowing Everton to commit men forward on the attack. McNeil receives it on the left on the edge of the box and drives a low strike just wide of the right post.
Everton are winless in 10 Premier League games (drawing five and losing five), the longest ongoing run of any side currently in the division. Only from August to October 1994 (12) have the Toffees ever had a longer winless run in the competition.
PENALTY UNITED! The hosts have the chance to double their lead after some superb work from Garnacho again. The Argentine drives from right to left on the edge of the box before being clattered by Godfrey. Two clumsy moments have cost Everton, who have been threatening on the attack.
Doucoure is not happy with the penalty being given and is shown a yellow card.
GOALLLL! RASHFORD SCORES! 2-0 UNITED! Fernandes scored the last penalty but gives this one to Rashford. The England international stutters on his run towards the ball before driving his strike into the bottom-left corner. Pickford commits himself the other way.
Garnacho is the first player to win two penalties in a single Premier League game since Antonio Rudiger for Chelsea v Leeds in December 2021, and the first ever to do so for United.
Everton win a free-kick just inside United's half. Pickford launches the ball forward, but Casemiro gets up head it away from danger just inside the box.
Everton have the 10th-highest xG in the Premier League this season (42.5), but the third-lowest goal total (29), giving them the biggest difference between expected goals and goals scored in the competition this term (13.5). The Toffees have created an xG of 0.9 against United, but have only hit the target twice with their nine shots.
Fernandes has possession in United's box, but he sends a pass straight to McNeil. The ball then rolls to Godfrey, who drives a low shot from the edge towards the bottom-left corner, but it deflects off Evans and goes behind.
Godfrey is well up the pitch, so when Everton concede possession, it gives Fernandes the chance to dash into the space left behind by the right-back. He gets into the box and attempts to curl a pass into the middle with the outside of his foot, but the ball is blocked, and Pickford comes out to claim it.
PENALTY SHOUT! United want a third penalty. Garnacho rushes down the right and gets to the byline before cutting the ball back across the box. Mykolenko slides to the floor, and the ball hits his supporting hand, but no penalty is given. Ten Hag is furious.
There will be four minutes of additional time.
Mainoo and McTominay combine down the left side of the box, but the ball gets trapped under the feet of the Scotland international. He rolls a pass back to Casemiro on the edge of the box, with the midfielder's low, first-time strike blocked by Onana.
Garnacho has been United's best player. He breaks forward on the right and drives into the box, faking it shoot to put Branthwaite on the floor before the centre-back gets across to recover. He had options in the middle, but nobody was complaining after his first-half performance.
HALF-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 2-0 EVERTON
United scored two penalties in the first half to lead a wasteful Everton 2-0 heading into half-time at Old Trafford. Garnacho was the Red Devils' star, winning both spot-kicks to give the hosts a comfortable advantage. He was first tripped by Tarkowski, allowing captain Fernandes to curl his spot-kick into the bottom-right corner. Harrison and Garner tested Onana, but it was Ten Hag's men that scored again. Garnacho was tricky on the edge of the box, driving across from right to left before being bundled to the floor by Godfrey. Rashford took the penalty this time, stuttering with his run towards the ball before directing his shot into the bottom-left corner.
It looks like United deserve their lead by a distance at half-time after creating an xG of 2.02, but the statistics have been heavily inflated by the two penalties. Despite not getting an assist to his name, Garnacho has been their best player, constantly driving at the Everton defence and winning two penalties. As for Everton, it's more of the same. Dyche was getting frustrated in the dugout, and there should be no surprise with his side failing to convert their opportunities again. The away side have registered an xG of 1.07 from their 11 shots but have only hit the target twice. They have had 29 final third entries and 17 touches inside the opposition box but nothing to show for it.
Everton get the ball rolling again. They need an early goal in the second half if they want to get back into the contest. The Toffees are on their way to an 11th consecutive Premier League game without a win.
United have won 180 and lost none of the 185 previous occasions they have been two or more goals ahead at half-time in the Premier League (drawing five). Meanwhile, away from home, Everton have lost 54 and won none of the 57 previous times they have been two or more goals behind at the break in the competition (drawing three). Not an encouraging statistic if you’re an Everton fan or Dyche. The Toffees have had most of the possession since the restart and are trying to build an attack.
Harrison collects the ball in the middle of United's half and spreads a pass down the right to Godfrey, who sends his cross behind for a goal-kick. Young or Coleman are better going forward than the former Norwich City man, but they are on the bench.
CHANCE! Everton go short with a free-kick on the left, unleashing McNeil on the wing. His inswinging cross is headed into the path of Doucoure by Tarkowski, but his strike in the middle of the box is blocked by McTominay.
Doucoure is Everton’s top scorer in the Premier League with six goals this season, though he hasn’t scored since December. Since Dyche became manager of the club last February, the Toffees have won 36 per cent of their league games when Doucoure starts (13/36), winning none of their nine when he doesn’t (drawing three and losing six).
OVER! Garnacho goes close! Fernandes spins in possession in the heart of Everton's half and rolls a pass out to Garnacho, who drives into the box. He is put under pressure by Mykolenko and lifts his right-footed strike over the bar.
Everton try to build an attack around the halfway line, but Onana puts too much power on his first-time pass, sending the ball out for a goal-kick. The Toffees are getting some substitutes ready to come on.
Beto has his first shot inside United's box, but his attempt is blocked. The ball spins up in the air, with the forward heading a pass down to Doucoure. The midfielder drives a low strike towards the near post, but Onana stops it with his feet.
WIDE! McTominay battles with Garner inside United's half, pushing him away before slotting a pass down the left to Fernandes. He gets into Everton's defensive third and sends an inviting cross towards Garnacho, but he pokes his effort wide on the slide.
Dyche has seen enough and has decided to make three changes. Beto has had 24 touches and one shot up front for Everton and is being replaced by Calvert-Lewin. The Englishman has scored three goals in 23 appearances.
Harrison also makes his way off the pitch at the nearest side. Dobbin is on, with his only Premier League goal coming against Chelsea in a 2-0 win earlier in the season.
There is also a straight swap in the midfield. Doucoure is replaced by Gomes.
SAVE! Brave from Pickford! Fernandes' inswinging cross from the right bobbles around the middle of the box, with Lindelof poking his shot towards the goal. Pickford claims it under pressure from Evans, who catches the goalkeeper and apologises immediately.
Gomes has space outside United's box and rolls a pass down the right to Dobbin for his first involvement. He takes a heavy touch but still finds a way to win a corner off Lindelof.
Lindelof barges into the back of Onana trying to win possession and gives away a poor free-kick in shooting range for Everton. The experienced Gomes takes aim from range, but his right-footed strike is blocked by the wall.
OVER! Dobbin gets a shot away, but it’s poor. Calvert-Lewin wrestles for the ball on the edge of the box but cannot turn away from his marker and rolls the ball back to Dobbin, who lashes a first-time strike with his left foot high and wide.
McTominay crashes into the back of Onana and is shown a yellow card. He was desperate to win possession in Everton's half, but he was clumsy.
United’s 40 Premier League wins against Everton is the joint-most one side has against another in the competition’s history, with the Red Devils also winning 40 times against Villa. They have only had four shots in the second half compared to Everton's seven, but they look comfortable. However, a shock goal from the Toffees could put them under pressure.
Nothing seems to be happening for Calvert-Lewin. He is working hard up front and puts pressure on Varane, but his back to Onana just about has enough weight on it for the goalkeeper to get there and clear. The Toffees get it back through McNeil. However, his cross goes straight to the goalkeeper.
There is a light round of applause from the home fans around the dugout as Young steps away from the bench to come on. He replaces Garner, who also spent time at the Red Devils.
WIDE! How have Everton not scored? Mykolenko flashes a brilliant cross from the left over to Godfrey, who heads the ball back across the goal. Dobbin is there, but his shot from a narrow angle goes back across Andre Onana and wide. He might have been looking for Calvert-Lewin, who was looking the other way.
Amadou Onana goes for an ambitious overhead kick from outside the box, but his shot is saved with ease by Andre Onana. That would have been goal of the season if it went in, but it never looked likely.
United make their first change. Mainoo was comfortable in the midfield and won three of his duels, but is now coming off for Amrabat.
Everton have had twice as many shots in the second half than United (8-4), also having more touches in the box (16-11). However, they have only created an xG of 0.41 since the restart and have had too many nearly moments.
McNeil floats a corner from the right onto Calvert-Lewin, but he cannot get enough power on his header, with the ball going straight into Onana's gloves.
Garnacho is denied the chance of an unlikely hat-trick of penalty wins, but he will be delighted with his contributions, turning the contest in United's favour with his direct runs into the box. He is off for Antony, who still has a lot to prove.
Young gets down the right and whips a corner towards the back post, with Mykolenko getting forward. Antony gets back well to defend it, forcing the left-back to direct his header wide.
United's work was done in the first half with the two penalties that they scored, but their performance since the restart has been pretty flat. They have only registered an xG of 0.54, hitting the target with two of their four shots. If Everton weren’t so clumsy in their box, the Red Devils would be playing in a much closer contest.
Chermiti comes on for his 11th Premier League appearance for Everton, still waiting for his first goal. Mykolenko is off, in what is a very late attacking change from Dyche, who probably should’ve done it a lot earlier.
United switch experience for youth in the defence. Evans is off for Kambwala, who makes his fourth Premier League appearance at centre-back for the hosts.
There will be four minutes of additional time.
Antony surges down the left and wins a late corner off Branthwaite. Fernandes elects to take it short, and the hosts work it out to Dalot outside the box, but he curls his right-footed strike straight at Pickford.
It's interesting that United are two goals ahead and have only made three changes, but Diallo hasn’t been given an opportunity off the bench. He has plenty of potential but only made two Premier League appearances this season.
OFFSIDE! Fernandes skips past a couple of tackles and slides a pass through to Rashford. He gets into the box and skips past Branthwaite, who takes down the forward. The referee blows for a penalty before changing his arm movement for an offside call.
FULL-TIME: MANCHESTER UNITED 2-0 EVERTON
Fernandes and Rashford scored first-half penalties for United to help the Red Devils beat Everton 2-0 at Old Trafford. It was more frustration for Dyche, who watched his team extend their run to 11 games without a win in the Premier League despite creating an xG of 1.48. Ten Hag's men made the most of their wasteful attacking and clumsy tackles, with Garnacho winning two penalties. First tripped by Tarkowski, captain Fernandes took responsibility from the spot and curled his shot into the bottom-right corner. Godfrey was the next player to barge into Garnacho inside the box after a tricky run from the Argentine. Rashford drilled his shot into the opposite corner, with United becoming just the third team in Premier League history to have two different players score a penalty in the first half. Everton had 12 attempts in the second half but couldn’t make any of their chances count. Dobbin had their best opportunity, but he flashed his effort across goal and away from danger. Next, United host Liverpool in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. As for Everton, they go to Bournemouth in the Premier League in three weeks. That's all for today, goodbye."	"Relegation-battling Burnley showed their fighting spirit by twice coming from behind despite playing most of the match with 10 men to draw 2-2 against Chelsea in a thrilling match at Stamford Bridge. 
Dara O’Shea’s late header claimed a point for Burnley after Lorenz Assignon had been sent off in the first half that could have been won by both sides late on.
How the match unfolded
There were two Chelsea changes as Benoit Badiashile and Mykhailo Mudryk came in, while  Burnley made two changes too. David Datro Fofana was ineligible against his parent club, so Lyle Foster was brought in as was Zeki Amdouni. 
Chelsea almost went ahead in the opening 10 minutes but Enzo Fernandez’s deflected strike was tipped on to the woodwork by Arijanet Muric in the Burnley goal. But Burnley threatened as Foster forced Djordje Petrovic into a full-length save. 
Muric again was called into action in the 19th minute as Nicolas Jackson weaved his way into the area but the Burnley ’keeper blocked his shot. From the resulting corner Chelsea thought they had gone in front after Axel Disasi had bundled the ball in at the back post, but the goal was overturned as the Chelsea defender had used his arm to score. 
Chelsea broke the deadlock just before half-time from the penalty spot. Mudryk overran a through-ball but Assignon bundled the winger over to concede the spot-kick and earn himself a second yellow card. Also sent off was Burnley boss Vincent Kompany for his protests. 
Cole Palmer stepped up to score his 12th league goal of the season and his 20th goal involvement of the campaign, only the fifth time a Chelsea player has done so in the Premier League. 
But inside the opening two minutes of the second half Burnley went level with a brilliant strike from Josh Cullen. The midfielder exchanged passes with Josh Brownhill and, although the ball was at an awkward height, Cullen lashed it first time into the net from outside the area for his first Premier League goal.
Burnley almost made it 2-1 through Foster’s header, but Petrovic stretched to his right to save. 
Palmer made Chelsea’s man advantage finally count in the 78th minute with a beautiful goal. Fernandez’s vertical pass was cleverly flicked by substitute Raheem Sterling to Palmer, who turned and clinically buried the ball into the far corner. 
O’Shea put Burnley back level in the 81st minute with a header that Petrovic was unable to keep out. 
Sterling then had a glorious chance to restore Chelsea’s lead but skewed a close-range shot wide. 
Burnley substitute Jay Rodriguez almost gave Burnley a famous win, his header hitting the bar before his follow-up volley off-balance was skied over. 
The point means Chelsea remain 11th on 40 points, while Burnley have 18 points in 19th, effectively five points from safety because of their poor goal difference.

Team_7	Team_6	"[""Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_14 and Team_9 at Old Trafford.\nUnited manager Erik ten Hag is under increased pressure after back-to-back defeats in the Premier League have seen his side slip 11 points behind fourth-placed Team_2 and a guaranteed place in next season's Champions League. The Red Devils had strung four consecutive top-flight wins together in February to put them in a strong position, but defeats to Team_10 and Team_13 have seen them drop to sixth place. United looked like they were on for a shock victory in the derby when Marcus Rashford gave them the lead with a thunderous strike heading into half-time. However, a brace from Phil Foden and a goal from Erling Haaland gave the Citizens a deserved victory, beating them 3.33-0.25 on xG (expected goals). As Team_2 and Team_18 play against each other tomorrow, one of United's rivals for a Champions League spot will certainly drop points, but it will only matter if the hosts win today.\nTeam_9 were handed a boost before their last Premier League outing against Team_19, with their appeal to reduce their 10-point punishment for breaching Profit and Sustainability Rules to six points lifting them from 17th to 15th. As a result, the Toffees moved five points clear of the relegation zone. However, their disappointing run in the top-flight continued, with the Hammers' stoppage-time victory extending Team_9 winless run to 10 games. They also had the lead at half-time after Beto made up for his penalty miss by scoring a header, but goals from Kurt Zouma, Tomas Soucek and\xa0Edson Alvarez\xa0helped David Moyes' men to all three points at Goodison Park. There is another possible points deduction for Team_9 looming, so an upturn in results is desperately needed for Sean Dyche to push them well away from the drop zone.\nTeam_14 (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Diogo Dalot, Raphael Varane, Jonny Evans, Victor Lindelof; Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro; Scott McTominay, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho; Marcus Rashford.\nTeam_14 SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Antony, Dermot Mee, Willy Kambwala, Toby Collyer, Habeeb Ogunneye.\nTeam_9 (4-5-1): Jordan Pickford; Ben Godfrey, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Jack Harrison, Amadou Onana, Abdoulaye Doucoure, James Garner, Dwight McNeil; Beto.\nTeam_9 SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Joao Virginia, Ashley Young, Andre Gomes, Seamus Coleman, Youssef Chermiti, Lewis Dobbin.\nUnited select the same side that started their 3-1 defeat to rivals City in their previous Premier League outing. Evans and Rashford were forced off with injuries against the Citizens but are fit enough to keep their place in the team. Youngsters Collyer and Ogunneye are on the bench and could make their top-flight debut for the Red Devils.\nDyche also keeps the faith in his side that were beaten 3-1 by Team_19 in their last match. There was a chance that Idrissa Gueye could’ve been fit enough to feature, but he hasn’t recovered from a groin injury and is out of the squad.\nUnited have won all three of their Premier League games against Team_9 since the start of last season, while they last won four league meetings in a row against the Toffees from November 2006 to December 2007. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.\nUnited get this Premier League clash under way. Fernandes has the first kick. Both teams desperately need a win.\nUnited are put under pressure by Team_9 early pressure in their defensive third, but Beto's low cross is blocked. The ball bobbles around the box, and neither side can take control, but the Red Devils eventually win it back.\nMcNeil wins an early corner on the left, with Garner strolling over to take it. However, his inswinging cross is headed away by Evans.\nMcNeil swings a deep cross from the left into the box, with Amadou Onana attacking it. The ball drops to Godfrey, who attempts to flick a shot at goal, but Andre Onana rushes off his line bravely to smother it.\nFernandes collects possession in the middle of Team_9 half and offloads a pass to Garnacho on his right. He strides forward and rolls the ball into Dalot, but he takes a heavy touch inside the box, allowing Onana to clear it well away.\nTeam_9 are looking sharp, but it could be that United are also gifting them the ball too often. Beto slides a pass out to Doucoure on the right, but his cross is claimed by Onana, who dives across the box.\nCHANCE! United go close out of nothing! Fernandes has the ball in United's half and switches the play over to Rashford, who darts down the left and into space. He gets past Mykolenko to get a shot away, but Harrison does brilliantly to get back and make an important block.\nFernandes takes the following corner from the right, swinging the ball onto Casemiro's header. However, his flicked effort is easily saved by Pickford.\nPENALTY UNITED! The hosts have a chance to take the lead from the spot! Rashford comes down the left and slides a pass into Garnacho, who flicks the ball past Tarkowski and is tripped inside the box. There is a VAR check for offside, but the penalty stands!\nGOALLLL!\xa0FERNANDES SCORES! 1-0 UNITED! What a penalty from Fernandes! The captain is cool under pressure, curling his penalty into the bottom-right corner. Pickford goes the right way, but he is beaten by the accuracy of the strike.\nCHANCE! Team_9 almost responded immediately. The ball drops kindly to McNeil on the box, with the winger volleying a left-footed effort just wide of the left post. Onana could only stand and watch the ball go just wide.\nThere is a loud atmosphere at Old Trafford, which could be inspired by the recent news that new co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build a new stadium. There has been some backlash, but all the home fans will set aside their concerns today and focus on supporting their side, looking to help United avoid defeat for the first time in three matches. Fernandes' goal came at the right time, with Team_9 building in confidence after a bright start.\nBranthwaite has possession in Team_9 half and looks to roll a throughball behind United's defence and into Beto, but the flag goes up for offside immediately. The striker was quite far off, as the play wasn't even allowed to continue to its conclusion.\nVarane comes forward down the left and switches a pass over to Garnacho on the right. He is in space and cuts the ball into Fernandes in the middle of the box, but he scoops his first-time strike well over.\nUnited regain possession on the halfway line, with McTominay ignoring Garnacho on the right and instead looking for Rashford on the left. However, he puts too much power on the ball, allowing Pickford to run off his line to claim it just inside the box.\nTeam_9 are getting shots away, but they are all coming from outside the box. This time, Harrison is given the time and space to crash a left-footed effort towards the goal, with his strike going well over the bar.\nBeto wrestles for the ball against Evans on the halfway line, throwing his arm in the face of the centre-back. Team_9 attack comes to nothing, but Evans isn’t happy with the striker. However, VAR sees no wrongdoing from the Portuguese forward.\nGodfrey gets to the byline and flashes a cross into the box, but it goes just past Beto in the middle. Team_9 retain possession through McNeil, who looks for another cross. However, Varane shields it behind.\nUnited gift the ball back to Team_9 again, but Mykolenko's strike from the edge is quickly blocked behind by Casemiro. Garner lifts his right-footed cross towards the back post, but Tarkowski cannot turn his header on target.\nCHANCE! Another opportunity for Team_9. Garner has space around him after playing a clever one-two outside United's box, but his strike is pushed away by Andre Onana. The goalkeeper pushes it straight out to Amadou Onana, who takes a touch before blasting his attempt well over.\nAmadou Onana is the first player to be shown a yellow card after fouling Garnacho on the edge of the Team_9 box.\nSAVE! Fernandes is denied his second goal. The captain takes responsibility for a free-kick just to the left outside the box and whips his right-footed effort towards the top-left corner. However, Pickford gets across his line to push it away at full stretch.\nCHANCE! Wonderful play from United. Rashford has possession on the left and switches the play over to Fernandes on the right side of the box. He rolls it through to McTominay, who thumps a cutback towards Mainoo. However, Branthwaite slides it away before the flag goes up for offside.\nEvans concedes possession in United's half to Beto, allowing Team_9 to commit men forward on the attack. McNeil receives it on the left on the edge of the box and drives a low strike just wide of the right post.\nTeam_9 are winless in 10 Premier League games (drawing five and losing five), the longest ongoing run of any side currently in the division. Only from August to October 1994 (12) have the Toffees ever had a longer winless run in the competition.\nPENALTY UNITED! The hosts have the chance to double their lead after some superb work from\xa0Garnacho again. The Argentine drives from right to left on the edge of the box before being clattered by Godfrey. Two clumsy moments have cost Team_9, who have been threatening on the attack.\nDoucoure is not happy with the penalty being given and is shown a yellow card.\nGOALLLL! RASHFORD SCORES! 2-0 UNITED! Fernandes scored the last penalty but gives this one to Rashford. The England international stutters on his run towards the ball before driving his strike into the bottom-left corner. Pickford commits himself the other way.\nGarnacho is the first player to win two penalties in a single Premier League game since Antonio Rudiger for Team_7 v Leeds in December 2021, and the first ever to do so for United.\nTeam_9 win a free-kick just inside United's half. Pickford launches the ball forward, but Casemiro gets up head it away from danger just inside the box.\nTeam_9 have the 10th-highest xG in the Premier League this season (42.5), but the third-lowest goal total (29), giving them the biggest difference between expected goals and goals scored in the competition this term (13.5). The Toffees have created an xG of 0.9 against United, but have only hit the target twice with their nine shots.\nFernandes has possession in United's box, but he sends a pass straight to\xa0McNeil. The ball then rolls to Godfrey, who drives a low shot from the edge towards the bottom-left corner, but it deflects off Evans and goes behind.\nGodfrey is well up the pitch, so when Team_9 concede possession, it gives Fernandes the chance to dash into the space left behind by the right-back. He gets into the box and attempts to curl a pass into the middle with the outside of his foot, but the ball is blocked, and Pickford comes out to claim it.\nPENALTY SHOUT! United want a third penalty. Garnacho rushes down the right and gets to the byline before cutting the ball back across the box. Mykolenko slides to the floor, and the ball hits his supporting hand, but no penalty is given. Ten Hag is furious.\nThere will be four minutes of additional time.\nMainoo and McTominay combine down the left side of the box, but the ball gets trapped under the feet of the Scotland international. He rolls a pass back to Casemiro on the edge of the box, with the midfielder's low, first-time strike blocked by Onana.\nGarnacho has been United's best player. He breaks forward on the right and drives into the box, faking it shoot to put Branthwaite on the floor before the centre-back gets across to recover. He had options in the middle, but nobody was complaining after his first-half performance.\nHALF-TIME: Team_14 2-0 Team_9\nUnited scored two penalties in the first half to lead a wasteful Team_9 2-0 heading into half-time at Old Trafford. Garnacho was the Red Devils' star, winning both spot-kicks to give the hosts a comfortable advantage. He was first tripped by Tarkowski, allowing captain Fernandes to curl his spot-kick into the bottom-right corner. Harrison and Garner tested Onana, but it was Ten Hag's men that scored again. Garnacho was tricky on the edge of the box, driving across from right to left before being bundled to the floor by Godfrey.

They need an early goal in the second half if they want to get back into the contest. The Toffees are on their way to an 11th consecutive Premier League game without a win.\nUnited have won 180 and lost none of the 185 previous occasions they have been two or more goals ahead at half-time in the Premier League (drawing five). Meanwhile, away from home, Team_9 have lost 54 and won none of the 57 previous times they have been two or more goals behind at the break in the competition (drawing three).

If Team_9 weren’t so clumsy in their box, the Red Devils would be playing in a much closer contest.\nChermiti comes on for his 11th Premier League appearance for Team_9, still waiting for his first goal. Mykolenko is off, in what is a very late attacking change from Dyche, who probably should’ve done it a lot earlier.\nUnited switch experience for youth in the defence. Evans is off for Kambwala, who makes his fourth Premier League appearance at centre-back for the hosts.\nThere will be four minutes of additional time.\nAntony surges down the left and wins a late corner off Branthwaite. Fernandes elects to take it short, and the hosts work it out to Dalot outside the box, but he curls his right-footed strike straight at Pickford.\nIt's interesting that United are two goals ahead and have only made three changes, but Diallo hasn’t been given an opportunity off the bench. He has plenty of potential but only made two Premier League appearances this season.\nOFFSIDE! Fernandes skips past a couple of tackles and slides a pass through to Rashford. He gets into the box and skips past Branthwaite, who takes down the forward. The referee blows for a penalty before changing his arm movement for an offside call.\nFULL-TIME: Team_14 2-0 Team_9\nFernandes and Rashford scored first-half penalties for United to help the Red Devils beat Team_9 2-0 at Old Trafford. It was more frustration for Dyche, who watched his team extend their run to 11 games without a win in the Premier League despite creating an xG of 1.48. Ten Hag's men made the most of their wasteful attacking and clumsy tackles, with Garnacho winning two penalties. First tripped by Tarkowski, captain Fernandes took responsibility from the spot and curled his shot into the bottom-right corner. Godfrey was the next player to barge into Garnacho inside the box after a tricky run from the Argentine. Rashford drilled his shot into the opposite corner, with United becoming just the third team in Premier League history to have two different players score a penalty in the first half. Team_9 had 12 attempts in the second half but couldn’t make any of their chances count. Dobbin had their best opportunity, but he flashed his effort across goal and away from danger. Next, United host Team_11 in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. As for Team_9, they go to Team_3 in the Premier League in three weeks. That's all for today, goodbye.""]"	0	0	1	0	1	0	2	Exciting
