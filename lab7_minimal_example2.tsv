93645	Team_7	Team_9	2024-04-15	Stamford Bridge, London	39392.0	Paul Tierney	Exciting	"Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the Premier League fixture between Team_3 and Team_14 at the Vitality Stadium!
Team_3 are looking to complete their first league double over Team_14, following their 3-0 win at Old Trafford in December. The Cherries are on an impressive run of form at the Vitality Stadium, winning each of their last three Premier League home games – they’ve never won four in a row at home in the top-flight before. In their last six matches, Andoni Iraola's side have won four, drew one, and lost one, with Team_12 coming out victorious last time out.
United's Europa League hopes are on the line once again as Erik ten Hag's side look to climb above Team_15 in sixth place in today's game. The Red Devils have won four of their six Premier League away games against Team_3, losing the other two in December 2015 (1-2) and November 2019 (0-1). In their last two Premier League matches United have conceded the first goal, gone on to take the lead but ultimately failed to win. Only Team_19 in April 2016 have ever done this in three consecutive games in the competition. Ten Hag will be looking to rely on his attacking trio, Alejandro Garnacho, Marcus Rashford, and Rasmus Hojlund, who have each scored seven times this season.
Team_3 (4-2-3-1): Neto; Milos Kerkez, Marcos Senesi, Illia Zabarnyi, Adam Smith; Ryan Christie, Lewis Cook; Dango Ouattara, Justin Kluivert, Luis Sinisterra; Dominic Solanke.
Team_3 SUBS: Lloyd Kelly, Romain Faivre, Alex Scott, James Hill, Enes Unal, Philip Billing, Max Aarons, Mark Travers, Michael Dacosta Gonzalez.
Team_14 (4-2-3-1): Andre Onana; Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire, Willy Kambwala, Diogo Dalot; Kobbie Mainoo, Casemiro; Marcus Rashford, Bruno Fernandes, Alejandro Garnacho; Rasmus Hojlund
Team_14 SUBS: Altay Bayindir, Sofyan Amrabat, Mason Mount, Christian Eriksen, Amad Diallo, Omari Forson, Harry Amass, Habeeb Ogunneye, Ethan Wheatley.
Iraola has made three changes from Team_3 loss away to Luton last time out in the Premier League. Marcus Tavernier and Antoine Semenyo both miss out and fail to make the squad, with Sinisterra and Ouattara both coming into the starting XI. In defence, Kelly will drop to the bench, with Senesi brought into the side.
Meanwhile, Ten Hag has named an unchanged side from United's draw at home to Team_11 in their previous fixture, despite his team suffering a host of injuries throughout the squad. It's a young bench for the Red Devils, with Wheatley, Ogunneye, Amass, and Forson, who are regulars for the United academy sides, all among the substitutes.
The players are making their way out onto the pitch ahead of kick-off.
Fernandes gets the game under way for Team_14 at the Vitality Stadium!
Team_3 will have an opportunity from a corner in the early stages of the game, and Christie is the player to take. He delivers towards the front post, but it's headed away by Fernandes. It falls to Kerkez on the edge of the area, but his wayward shot is high and wide and it goes behind for a goal-kick to United.
The ball falls to Neto inside his own penalty area and he sends it long, over the top of the United defence. Sinisterra is chasing it and he looks to get on the end of it, but the pass is overhit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to Ten Hag's side.
Mainoo is dispossessed in a dangerous position and it falls to Christie on the edge of the United penalty area. He drives into the box and looks to create space for himself, shifting onto his left before firing across goal, but Maguire slides across well to fire the ball out for a throw-in to the Cherries.
Team_3 look to counter-attack as they win it back inside their own half, and Ouattara sends a long, searching pass towards Sinisterra on the left-hand side, but his pass is slightly overhit and it goes off the side of the pitch for a throw-in. The Cherries need to show a little more quality if they want to break United down.
Hojlund breaks down the left-hand side after tussling with the Team_3 defenders, but United turn back towards their own goal and keep possession. Ten Hag's side aren't taking too many risks on the ball at the moment, and they're yet to create a chance since the game got under way.
United have enjoyed more of the possession since the start of the game, having 65.9 per cent of the ball. The Red Devils are yet to create a shot on goal, touching the ball inside the Team_3 box just four times. It's been a slow start for Ten Hag's side.
GOOOAAAAALLL!! 1-0 Team_3!! Garnacho gives the ball away and Senesi fires the ball in behind the defence, and Solanke runs onto it. He cuts inside onto his right foot and Kambwala slips, creating space for the English striker. He shifts it onto his right and unleashes from outside of the box, and it flies into the bottom corner!
Senesi won the ball around the halfway line and poked it in behind the United defence, allowing Solanke to run onto it and score.
United should equalise! Casemiro finds Rashford and the English forward drives into the Team_3 penalty area. He fakes to shoot and drags it onto his left foot before striking towards goal, but it flies into the side netting and goes behind for a goal-kick to the Cherries. He should be hitting the target from there.
Team_3 go close! Christie clips a pass in behind the United defence and Kerkez runs onto it, beating Garnacho to the ball. He carries it into the penalty area and closes in on goal, and he attempts to beat Onana at his near post, but the Cameroonian goalkeeper makes a strong save to deny him.
There is a break in play as the referee heads down the tunnel. There is a communication problem for the officials and the game has been halted while they attempt to solve the issue. After a short delay, the referee is back on the pitch and the match can continue.
Team_3 come forward again as Kerkez plays a one-two with Christie as he bursts into the United penalty area. He looks to get on the end of the pass in a dangerous position, but he can't get it under control and the ball bounces behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries go close! Sinisterra lays the ball into the path of Christie as Team_3 pounce on a loose ball inside the United half. The midfielder carries it forward and unleashes a powerful effort towards goal, but he narrowly misses the target as his shot flies over the bar and behind for a goal-kick.
Casemiro fails to control the ball in the middle of the pitch and it falls to Christie, who fires it out wide to Sinisterra. He drives into the penalty area and pulls it back to Christie, and he gets it out of his feet before taking aim, but Onana reads the situation well and gets across to make the save.
GOOOAAAALLLL!! 1-1! United equalise! Hojlund turns just outside the box and finds Garnacho, who looks to pull it back to the edge of the area. It comes to Rashford who finds Garnacho once again, and he fires the ball across goal and into the danger zone. It deflects into the air and Fernandes strikes it on the volley, and it fires into the roof of the net!
United look to counter-attack, but Senesi brings down Garnacho and receives the first yellow of the game.
Big chance for Team_3! Solanke carries the ball through the middle and slots a pass into the feet of Ouattara. He gets one-on-one with Kambwala and creates space for himself on his left foot, before firing a shot towards the bottom corner, but it whistles past the post. The Cherries were inches away from grabbing a second!
GOOOOOAAAAALLL!! 2-1 Team_3! Senesi carries the ball out of defence and picks out Kluivert, who has drifted into space between the United defence. He drives into the box and works it onto his right foot, and he sends a powerful strike into the bottom corner, and Onana can't get a hand to it!
Senesi was afforded plenty of space to carry the ball out of defence, and he picked out Kluivert with ease.
Team_3 have an injury problem right now as Sinisterra has gone to ground, and he looks in some discomfort. The medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment, and there's some activity on the bench. It looks as though he might struggle to continue.
Iraola makes the first change of the game, with the injured Sinisterra limping towards the bench. Kelly comes on in his place.
What a chance! Smith sends a first-time cross into the penalty area, and Kerkez has burst forward into the box. He rises above his marker and heads towards goal, but it cannons off the bar! It falls straight back into his path and he looks to head it into the back of the net, but this time he sends it over and behind for a goal-kick.
The Cherries are good value for their lead in the first half, having produced 11 shots with four of those being on target. United have managed just three strikes, with Fernandes' shot the only one hitting the target. Conceding chances has been a major problem for the Red Devils this season, with only Team_17 giving up more shots this term.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of nine minutes of added time at the end of the first half.
Dalot makes a strong challenge deep inside the United half on Kelly, and Team_3 will now have a chance to fill the box. Cook will be the player to take and he whips a dangerous cross towards goal, but Casemiro clears. The ball comes back into the penalty area and Kluivert is there from just a few yards out, but Onana makes an excellent save to deny him!
Kluivert wins the ball in the middle of the park and picks out Kerkez inside the penalty area. He checks back onto his right foot and goes to ground under the challenge of Dalot, but the referee says no penalty and waves away their protests! The Vitality Stadium faithful were confident that was a foul, but nothing is given!
Wan-Bissaka drives with the ball into the Team_3 penalty area and looks to swing a cross into the box with his left, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Fernandes takes and he sends a looping cross towards the back post, but Neto rushes off his line to punch it away from danger.
Fernandes receives a pass on the left touchline and looks to attack the space in the middle, carrying the ball as he approaches the edge of the penalty area. He takes aim towards goal, sending a curling effort towards the top corner, but it strikes the top of the bar and goes behind!
HALF-TIME: Team_3 2-1 Team_14
Team_3 go into the break with a 2-1 lead over Team_14 at the Vitality Stadium. The Cherries opened the scoring through Solanke who was given far too much time and space outside the box, and his powerful effort flew into the bottom corner to give the home side the lead. Iraola's men kept pushing to find the second goal, but it was United who struck next, with Fernandes pouncing inside the box to fire into the roof of the net. Just a few minutes later, Team_3 were back in front, with Kluivert finding space between Kambwala and Dalot, before cutting onto his right foot and firing past Onana between the sticks. The Cherries are deservedly in front, with United giving up too many opportunities.
The Cherries, who now have a 62.8 per cent chance of winning according to Opta's live probability calculator, have allowed United to have more of the possession, with the Red Devils keeping 59.1 per cent of the ball. However, Team_3 have been more effective when they do have it, creating 1.27 expected goals (xG) compared to United's 0.34. Iraola's men have managed 11 shots with Ten Hag's side only producing three so far. The Dutch manager might be considering some early changes in the second half after a disappointing display in the opening 45 minutes. Due to injuries, United don't have a plethora of options to choose from, but they could call upon the likes of Mount or Diallo to make a difference. Iraola will be asking for more of the same after the break, while Ten Hag will be desperate to see his side drastically improve.
Ten Hag makes a change at the break, as Diallo replaces Garnacho.
Team_3 get the second half under way at the Vitality Stadium!
Dalot commits a foul on Kerkez on the left-hand side of attack, and Team_3 will throw bodies forward from the free-kick. Cook has come over to the touchline to take, and he lays it to the edge of the area towards Kluivert, but his first-time strike is blocked and United can clear.
Diallo finds Casemiro who turns and quickly picks out Mainoo on the right-hand side. He feeds Diallo who has burst into the box, and he goes down inside the penalty area, but the referee is having none of it. There was nothing in it, and the game resumes as Team_3 are able to clear.
Rashford receives a pass on the left touchline and he fires it into the feet of Hojlund. He quickly finds Fernandes who looks to return the favour as he hopes to feed the United striker with a throughball into the box, but Hojlund isn't on the same wavelength and Team_3 regain possession.
Kluivert turns Kambwala with ease and the United defender falls to the floor, and he drives towards the penalty area. He creates space to get a shot off and strikes towards goal, but his effort is blocked and the Red Devils are able to hoof the ball away from danger.
Christie tussles with Diallo and manages to pick out Kluivert on the left-hand side. He gets it out of his feet before sending a low cross into the box. Solanke looks to get there from just a few yards out, but Kambwala comes across to put it behind for a corner. Cook sends it into the penalty area, but the referee blows for a foul. United will have a free-kick.
Diallo cuts in from the right and finds Rashford, who slots the ball into the box for Wan-Bissaka to run onto. He turns back towards his own goal and picks out Rashford again who delivers into the penalty area, but Zabarnyi is there to intercept and he's able to clear.
United enjoy a spell of possession and Diallo drives through the middle of the pitch, but he's fouled by Kluivert and they win a free-kick. Fernandes looks to take and he sends it into the box, but Zabarnyi wins the header. The Portuguese midfielder isn't happy, he wanted more movement from his team-mates.
PENALTY TO UNITED! Mainoo receives the ball outside of the penalty area, and he shifts it onto his right before striking towards goal. His effort deflects off Christie and hits the arm of Smith inside the box, and the referee points to the spot! Fernandes will have an opportunity to score from 12 yards.
GOOOOAAAALLL!! 2-2! United equalise! Fernandes steps up to the spot with Neto between the sticks. He takes his time before starting his run-up, and he rolls the ball to his right-hand side and into the back of the net, sending the Team_3 goalkeeper the wrong way, and the Red Devils draw themselves level!
The Cherries might feel a little hard done by to have conceded the equaliser, with United managing just three touches inside the opposition box in the second half. The Red Devils have produce just two shots in the second half, with one of those being Fernandes' penalty.
Iraola makes an alteration as Ouattara heads to the bench. Faivre comes on in his place.
There's a change at right-back for the Cherries, with Aarons entering the fray. Smith makes way.
Solanke does well to get away from the challenge of Dalot, and he quickly finds Cook in the middle of the park. He shifts the ball out wide to Kluivert, and he sends a searching cross into the penalty area towards Solanke. However, his delivery is overhit and it goes behind for a goal-kick to United.
There's a break in play with Kluivert down injured, and the medical team are on the pitch giving him treatment. There's a delay to restart the game, as it looks like the Dutch winger isn't going to be able to continue. Team_3 are readying a change.
Kluivert hobbles to the bench after picking up an injury, and Unal will come on to replace him.
Mainoo's game is over as United make another substitution. Mount comes off the bench to replace him.
Dalot creates something out of nothing as he drives down the left-hand side before delivering into the box. Rashford looks to get on the end of it, but it's deflected behind for a corner. Fernandes plays it short, but the referee has spotted a foul inside the penalty area and Team_3 have a free-kick.
Diallo is dispossessed by Kerkez who carries the ball down the left-hand side. He crosses into the box, but Kambwala is there to put it behind for a corner. Cook delivers into the penalty area, but Maguire heads it away. Team_3 regain possession, but nothing comes of it.
Cook collects a clearance and picks out Aarons on the right-hand side, and he drives into the middle of the pitch. Hojlund slips, creating space for the Team_3 defender, and he takes aim from outside of the box, but his ambitious effort is dragged wide of the post and it goes behind for a goal-kick.
Christie goes into the book for a dive inside the penalty area as he looked to take on Dalot.
Cook will also receive a yellow for his protests to the referee.
Wan-Bissaka looks to send a first-time pass into the penalty area, but Zabarnyi gets up well to head it away. His clearance only goes as far as Diallo, who is in space inside the box, but doesn't connect properly with the volley and it goes high and wide into the stands behind the goal.
The fourth official has indicated that there will be a minimum of six minutes of added time at the end of the game.
Neto goes into the referee's book for his reaction to a tackle from Wan-Bissaka.
Unal does well to win a corner for the Cherries, forcing Casemiro into putting the ball behind. Cook is standing over it and Team_3 have filled the penalty area as they search for a winner. It's delivered towards the front post, but Kambwala heads away. It comes to Cook once again and he sends a dangerous cross into the box, but Dalot puts it behind.
The referee points to the spot! Christie pounces on a loose ball and drives into the box, but Kambwala crashes into him, and the referee awards a penalty! VAR is checking the decision, as it looks like it could be outside of the penalty area. There's going to be a delay as they check this one. The referee has overturned his decision. It's a free-kick to the Cherries on the edge of the box! NO PENALTY!
United come forward now with Mount, and he picks out Dalot and Ten Hag's side keep possession. Fernandes sends it long towards Maguire and he wins it and finds Hojlund, but he struggles to keep hold of the ball and Team_3 are able to clear in the final few minutes of the game.
FULL-TIME: Team_3 2-2 Team_14
Team_3 and Team_14 share the spoils with a 2-2 draw at the Vitality Stadium. The Cherries opened the scoring in the first half through Solanke, with his powerful shot flying into the bottom corner from outside of the box, leaving Onana with no chance. Iraola's side pushed for the second, but against the run of play, Fernandes popped up in the penalty area to volley in an equaliser from just a few yards out. It didn't take long for Team_3 to get back in front, as Kluivert drifted in from the right-hand side to fire in at the near post before half-time, with the Cherries going into the break with a narrow lead. In the second half, Iraola's men looked threatening in the final third, but United were awarded a penalty after Smith handled inside the box, and Fernandes tucked it away to equalise for United. There was almost late drama as Team_3 were given a stoppage-time penalty, but after a VAR review, the officials decided that the foul was committed outside of the area. Ten Hag's side have now won just once in their last seven Premier League games, while the Cherries, who finished with a higher xG (1.75 to 1.18), extend their unbeaten run at home to four matches. That's all for today, goodbye!"	"Cole Palmer sensationally scored FOUR goals as Mauricio Pochettino oversaw his biggest win with Team_7, his side making up ground in the race for Europe with a 6-0 home win over Team_9.
In a topsy-turvy season, Palmer has so often dragged Team_7 through, and he followed up his dramatic treble against Team_14 in their previous game at Stamford Bridge with four more goals.
His first goal made him the first Team_7 player to score in seven straight Premier League home appearances, and he went on to net the earliest ever hat-trick by a Blues player in the competition, in the 29th minute.
Adding his fourth goal from the penalty spot, he took his tally to 20 Premier League goals for the season, moving level with his former Team_13 team-mate Erling Haaland in the race for the Castrol Golden Boot.
Although Team_7 ended Monday's match in ninth, just as they had started it, Palmer's haul – plus a strike from Nicolas Jackson and a first Premier League goal from Alfie Gilchrist – boosted hopes of a late surge towards the top six.
Pochettino's men, who are unbeaten in eight Premier League matches, are only three points behind sixth-placed Team_15 and have a game in hand.
How the match unfolded
Team_9 should have been ahead in the 10th minute when Seamus Coleman picked out Beto in front of an open goal, only for the forward to put the ball over the crossbar with his knee.
Opta measured the chance as being worth 0.96 Expected Goals, essentially meaning Beto would be expected to score 96 times out of 100, but the Team_9 striker missed the target entirely.
Facing a Team_7 side who had conceded at least twice in each of their previous seven matches in all competitions, Team_9 again came up short in front of goal.
Palmer soon made the visitors pay, nutmegging Jarrad Branthwaite and trading passes with Jackson before shaping a fine, first-time finish into the bottom-left corner.
After inadvertently deflecting a goalbound shot wide with his back, man of the moment Palmer helped himself to a swift second, heading in the rebound from Jackson's close-range shot. 
And two became three when Jordan Pickford's slack pass was picked off by the 21-year-old, who ruthlessly lobbed his England team-mate from 40 yards.
Beto was well offside when he thought he had pulled a goal back - and instead Team_9 were four behind at the break as Jackson brought down Marc Cucurella's cross and fired in at Pickford's right-hand post.
Palmer initially had to wait for his fourth as Pickford blocked with his legs. But the hat-trick hero added to his tally from the penalty spot after being fouled by Abdoulaye Doucoure and winning an argument over who would take the spot-kick.
That row was the only dampener on the evening for the Blues, with Pochettino stating after the match that it was ""a shame"" and that he had told his players ""it's the last time I accept this type of behaviour"".
Academy graduate Gilchrist completed the scoring in the 90th minute as he lashed in his first professional goal.
Team_9 continue to look over their shoulder, lying only two points above the relegation zone in 16th place ahead of a HUGE duel with 17th-placed Team_16 on Sunday."
93638	Team_4	Team_7	2024-04-07	Bramall Lane, Sheffield	28638.0	Robert Jones	High Stakes	"Hello and welcome to the live coverage of Team_11’s Premier League game against Team_17!
It is over to you Team_11! Team_1 and Team_13 both picked up wins yesterday and it means the Reds dropped to second in the Premier League. It is a difficult job to call the Premier League title, but if Team_11 win all their games they will be crowned champions and in the league it is something Team_11 often do. They have only lost once in the Premier League in 2024, and that was against the Gunners but this time the pressure is on Jurgen Klopp’s men if they want to return to the top.
Team_17’s season has been the polar opposite of their opponents, they have had a disastrous season and find themselves 10 points adrift, albeit with two games in hand. One of them is tonight and looking at how 2024 has treated them it could be a challenging evening. They have one once, although a second victory was close at the weekend against Team_10. They went 3-1 up but a last-gasp overhead kick from Rodrigo Muniz meant the points were shared. It was a heartbreaking result but can they bounce back in spectacular fashion tonight?
Team_11 (4-3-3): Caoimhin Kelleher; Conor Bradley, Ibrahima Konate, Virgil Van Dijk, Joe Gomez; Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch; Mohamed Salah, Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz.
SUBSTITUTES: Adrian, Bobby Clark, Jayden Danns, Harvey Elliott, Cody Gakpo, Curtis Jones, Jarell Quansah, Andy Robertson, Kostas Tsimikas.
Team_17 (3-5-2): Ivo Grbic; Mason Holgate, Anel Ahmedhodzic, Auston Trusty; Jayden Bogle, Vini Souza, Ollie Arblaster, Gustavo Hamer, Jack Robinson; James McAtee, Ben Brereton Diaz.
SUBSTITUTES: Andre Brooks, Sam Curtis, Wes Foderingham, Yasser Larouci, Oli McBurnie, Oliver Norwood, Ben Osborn, William Osula, Anis Ben Slimane.
Many managers took this midweek round of fixtures to rest some players, but Klopp hasn’t done that. He has gone full strength, or as much as he can anyway. The obvious absentees are Trent Alexander-Arnold and Alisson, but Bradley and Kelleher have been great when called upon. In fact Kelleher would feel hard done by if he had to return to the bench, but that is the life of a back-up goalkeeper. Salah is having another fine season and he is one of two players who is in the top ten for goals and assists, so United’s left side will have a busy evening for sure.
One of Team_17’s best performers arrived in January. Brereton Diaz is on loan from Villareal and he ranks third for goals and assists contributed in this side, he has four goals and an assist only McBurnie and Hamer top that. Talk about an instant impact! He is up against Van Dijk and Konate, who he recently faced in Chile’s friendly against France. He didn’t have much joy then but maybe that will change in this match.
Anfield in April is a scary proposition, they haven’t lost in this month at home since 2017, Team_17 have a tough ask to break that run but they have drawn their last two games so maybe they can bring a new-found confidence into the match. Anyway, we will find out shortly.  Kick-off is moments away.
Stuart Attwell blows his whistle and we are underway at Anfield!
WHAT A CHANCE! A long throw-in causes all sorts of problems for Team_11 and McAtee connects with the flick-on but is denied by Kelleher.
It has been a lively start so far, United have taken the game to Team_11 early on and it seems to have caught Team_11 by surprise.
A bit of a break in play here. As Gravenberch and Vini Souza clash, it looks like they are both okay.
Grbic slaps Gomez's cross away straight to Salah, which is something you don't want to do, and the Egyptian attempts to loft it over the keeper but he does well to recover and make the save.
After a frantic start, Team_11 are just keeping hold of the ball for the first time in the game. Team_17 are defending well for now.
Team_11 work the ball to Bradley well and he fires a ball into United's box. Holgate is there and he doesn't mess around smashing it out for a throw-in.
It could be a long 90 minutes for Team_17, they have defended resoundingly so far and Salah has to opt to shoot from distance but it goes nowhere near the target.
Konate tries to go more direct into Salah but it is slightly over hit and Grbic comes over and picks up the ball.
GOAAAL! WHAT A SLICE OF LUCK! Grbic won't want to see that again. He dawdles on the ball which allows Nunez to close him down and the keeper whacks it against the striker and it bobbles in. It was a gift but Nunez didn't care, he ran off in celebration like he scored a worldie. It is 1-0 to Team_11 and they return to the top of the table for now.
Team_17 have now conceded 78 goals in the Premier League, which is the most they have conceded in the top flight since 1975-76. I doubt they would have conceded an easier goal than that, Wilder wouldn't have been happy.
Nunez is proving to be a handful today. He somehow gets past multiple Team_17 defenders and fires a shot towards Grbic but this time he matches the effort.
The Blades can't get out at all, one of the five defenders wins the ball back, then has a look up but can't find a teammate so hit it long. It is going to be a tiring 65 minutes if this continues.
There is a break in play to allow players to break their fast.
We are back to the action and United have a rare flurry forward which ends with McAtee taking a free-kick that goes straight into the hands of Kelleher.
As Team_17 try to stop Team_11 constant waves of attack you can hear Chris Wilder barking instructions to his team. They have been good so far, bar a severe stroke of misfortune.
SO CLOSE! Diaz lays the ball off to Mac Allister, he then takes a touch and strikes the ball that flashes past the post. He has scored from a similar distance this season and it wasn't far off.
Team_11 are hardly having to exert themselves on the ball. They are just finding a teammate with ease although it hasn't resulted in loads of clear-cut chances.
If you didn't know the Team_11 formation you would wonder why Konate has found himself in a wide position. The Reds have been so fluid in the opening half, with Gomez especially popping up in all sorts of positions. The Blades are struggling to keep hold of their men.
WOW! Diaz showed great skill to get past Bogle and then find Gravenberch. He decided to shoot and it went straight into Grbic's hands, and with Nunez waiting in a dangerous position, he wasn't too happy he didn't receive the pass.
A little bit of late pressure from Team_17. Team_11 manage to deal with it at first but then Ahmedhodzic was found behind the Reds' defence but the Bosnian was offside.
Diaz cuts in from the left-hand side and fizzes a shot after finding space, but it goes past Grbic's goal.
KELLEHER SAVES! Brereton Diaz flicks the ball through to Bogle, who hits a fierce effort into the bottom corner but his shot is met by a strong Kelleher hand.
HALF-TIME: Team_11 1-0 Team_17
Team_11 lead and it wasn't without a huge stroke of luck. Grbic whacks his clearance against the on-rushing Nunez and it rolls into the back of the net. The Reds' dominance makes the deserved leaders, but Grbic hasn't been tasted with much difficulty just yet. In fact, Kelleher had to make the first save, and it was vital to deny McAtee's close-range effort in the opening minute. The Blades have struggled to get out of their half, but when they have they look threatening, but Team_11 are in control as expected.
It is a worry for Wilder that whenever Team_11 up the tempo his side struggles to handle them, but the home side haven't been able to do that on too many occasions with long shots often being a likely source of many of their efforts. United have shown glimpses but they need a more dominant focal point who can help them relieve a bit of the pressure if they want to really take the game to Team_11. For now, Wilder will be happy, just as long as there isn't another calamitous mistake.
We are back underway here with Team_11 leading but only slightly. Can Team_17 spoil the party in the second half?
Gomez is still searching for his first-ever senior goal. He must get sick of people telling him that, but he tries to break that run of 253 games without a goal by shooting from the edge of the box but he drags it and it goes wide. The wait continues.
Salah was well marshalled before the break, and he has his first sight of goal in the second period. He set himself up and then struck a volley but again Grbic isn't tested too much and collects with ease.
Hamer sets Brereton Diaz on his way, but the Chilean is on his own and he runs into Konate. It was a poor run and he didn't fancy taking on Konate, who dealt with it easily.
Hamer has a free-kick on the right side of the area. He decides to shoot and it was creeping into the bottom left corner but the lack of power allowed Kelleher to come across.
This second half hasn't helped the atmosphere at Anfield. It has become a nervy, anxious crowd and they were probably a bit more expectant of a result. Team_17 aren't giving in though and the longer it goes on, the better it is for the Blades.
GOAL! Team_17 ARE LEVEL! IT IS 1-1! After the goal they conceded in the first half, it is time for the Blades to get a bit of fortune. Hamer creeps around the back of Bradley and heads it against the full-back who nutmegs his keeper, and it is a massive goal.
Klopp has made a big call here. He has replaced Salah with Elliott, let's see if he can get Team_11 back in front.
Klopp also turns to Robertson, and he replaces Gravenberch, which means Gomez might go into midfield.
Wilder also makes a batch of changes. Hamer injured himself in the equaliser and he comes off for Osborn.
There is also a new look attack here, with Osula making his way on the pitch in the place of Brereton Diaz.
McAtee had a great chance in the opening minute, but couldn't really leave his mark on the game and is replaced by McBurnie.
WHAT A SAVE! Parts of the Anfield crowd jump up and cheer as Van Dijk's header goes towards goal, but Grbic gets down well to parry it away. The cheers quickly disappeared.
Team_17 aren't holding onto the draw and have found themselves having more joy against Team_11 backline. Although they have to be wary of Team_11 and Ahmedhodzic gets a vital touch on the ball to get it out of the way of Diaz.
Trusty goes down after a tussle with Van Dijk. It did look like the Dutchman grabbed him by the throat, but he got away with it.
With Team_11 still struggling to open Team_17 up, Klopp makes more substitutes. Gakpo enters the pitch for Gomez.
Jones also gets 17 minutes to make an impact as he replaces Szoboszlai. Time is ticking by and can these subs be the difference?
WHAT A CHANCE! Elliott lofts a ball towards the back post, where Robertson is rushing in. The Scot gets good contact on the ball but it fires past Grbic's goal. It has been their best opportunity in a while.
Not much praise can go to Diaz here, it was all about the strike from Mac Allister. That is one way to send your side back to the Premier League summit.
OH WOW! IT IS AN ABSOLUTE CRACKER AND Team_11 GO AHEAD 2-1! Alexis Mac Allister with the strike and it has a huge implication on the title race. He catches a loose ball and sends an unsavable shot from the edge of the area, into the top corner. Team_11 lead the table again.
Wilder responds to that setback with a change, Brooks is coming on for Trusty.
Team_11 regain control of this game, and Gakpo is there waiting for the ball to fall to him but he shoots over. It is a really poor effort. He could have added some comfort to the score.
OFF THE CROSSBAR! Mac Allister is fancying it now. He is full of confidence, as he hits another clean free-kick and it crashes off the crossbar. Grbic could do little about it again, luckily the woodwork rescues him.
McBurnie picks up a yellow card, and it is an easy decision. He elbows Konate and when Attwell shows him the card he can't really complain. He still did though.
A defensive substitution here. Holgate makes way for Slimane and he may have a lot of work to do in the final few moments of this match.
IT IS A THIRD! GAME OVER! Cody Gakpo makes it 3-1 and Team_11 are finishing this game in style. The Dutchman is there waiting to nod in Robertson's cross and he gets enough power to beat Grbic. It is a great finish. Team_11 should be home and dry now.
It is a great cross from Robertson, who has been so lively since coming on. He picks the ball up and like we are all used to seeing, he finds a teammate who gets the important third goal.
There is a big chunk of added time here. Seven minutes and it looks like Team_11 might want to get one more goal here.
Robertson walks over to take the corner, although he can't match his recent delivery and it is well-cleared by Team_17.
Klopp has managed to rescue this game, and the subs he has made have been so impressive. Especially Gakpo who has had a difficult spell recently. That goal will do him the world of good, and at the right moment for Team_11 sake.
Nunez could have made it four. He does well to win the header but it has no control and it flies over the bar.
FULL-TIME: Team_11 3-1 Team_17
Team_11 get the job done and return to the top of the Premier League, but at times in this game that didn't look likely. Nunez created his own luck to chase down Grbic and block his clearance that rolled into the empty net and for the majority of the half Team_11 dominated. Although in the second half, Bradley's own goal provided a scare to Team_11 fans, and until the 76th minute the Reds struggled to find a way through, despite the xG being 1.65 - 0.59 in their favour. Mac Allister scored a goal that deserved to win the game, and a title potentially whacking a fierce strike into the very top corner of Grbic's goal. He could do nothing about it, and Cody Gakpo secured the victory late on and ensured Team_11 weren't to lose chase on Team_1. With only eight league games remaining in Klopp's Team_11 career, they are currently the front runners, and are two points clear. Thanks for joining us and goodbye1"	"Oli McBurnie poked home in second-half stoppage time to rescue a point for Team_17 as they pegged Team_7 back twice to draw 2-2 at Bramall Lane. 
Team_7 looked all set to register a potentially crucial win in the hunt for a European place when Noni Madueke restored their lead in the 66th minute, after Jayden Bogle had cancelled out Thiago Silva’s early opener. 
Yet Team_7’s inadequacies were again put on display as Mauricio Pochettino’s team failed to clear their lines in the third minute of added time, enabling McBurnie to turn home from close range and send the home fans into raptures. 
While the Blades remain bottom of the standings, nine points from safety, Team_7 missed a great chance to further their European hopes, with the Blues sitting ninth, five points behind sixth-placed Team_14. 
How the match unfolded 
Team_7 profited from some slack defending on an 11th-minute corner as an unmarked Silva volleyed into the bottom-left corner, netting his third Premier League goal of the season. 
The momentum swung in United’s favour after that, and they almost made the Blues pay for a mix-up at the back, but Ben Brereton Diaz failed to apply the finish with the goal gaping. 
Yet the Blades got the goal their play deserved when Gustavo Hamer unlocked Team_7’s defence with an inch-perfect pass to Bogle, who beat Djordje Petrovic from a tight angle. 
The Blades remained a threat after the break, but struggled to find their finishing touch as McBurnie thumped a header wide before Hamer whipped an effort past the post with the outside of his boot. 
They were made to rue those missed chances when Madueke skipped inside from the right wing and unleashed a powerful shot that flew beyond Ivo Grbic. 
But with Grbic having denied Cole Palmer, the Blades’ pressure finally told deep into stoppage time – McBurnie keeping himself onside from Cameron Archer’s flick-on and coolly poking beyond Djordje Petrovic to snatch a deserved share of the spoils. 
With seven matches left to play, the Blades still look destined to drop out into the Championship, and their defending – specifically at home – has cost them dearly. 
They have set an unwanted record as they have now conceded 47 goals in 16 Premier League home matches this season, one more than Watford in 2021/22, who conceded 46 in that campaign. 
In their nine matches at Bramall Lane since Chris Wilder returned to the club, they have shipped 28 of those goals. 
After that thrilling 4-3 win over Man Utd on Thursday, Team_7 had the perfect chance to push on and close further ground on the Red Devils and their other rivals for a UEFA Europa League or Europa Conference League spot. 
Yet as has been the case all season, Team_7’s soft underbelly was left exposed and they could not come away with all three points.

93644	Team_6	Team_5	2024-04-13	Turf Moor, Burnley	20687.0	Simon Hooper	High Stakes & Exciting	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_9 and Team_6 at Goodison Park.
Team_9 extended their torrid winless run in the Premier League to 13 games with a 1-1 draw with Team_15 in their previous fixture, only once going longer without a league victory in their history (14 matches in 1937). However, it is not all negative for the Toffees, who will take pride in snatching a draw at St James' Park, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin scoring his first goal in 18 top-flight outings with an 88th-minute penalty after Alexander Isak opened the scoring for the Magpies in the first half. It means Team_9 are in 16th position, just four points above Team_12 in the relegation zone, but they have played one fewer fixture than the Hatters.
Team_6 have shown signs of promise in the last few weeks and are unbeaten in their previous four matches. However, Vincent Kompany will be frustrated with three draws in that run. The Clarets took a 2-0 lead against Team_19 before the Hammers came from behind to earn a point, before beating 10-man Team_4 2-1. A hearty 2-2 draw with Team_7 followed, with Team_6 dropping points in their last match against Team_20. Jacob Bruun Larsen’s 37th-minute goal gave them. The lead before Rayan Ait-Nouri levelled just before half-time. As a result, Team_6 are in 19th position and are in danger of an immediate return to the Championship. They are six points behind Team_16, who are just outside the relegation zone and will be desperate to get the better of an out-of-form Team_9 side under former manager Sean Dyche.
Team_9 (4-5-1): Jordan Pickford; Seamus Coleman, James Tarkowski, Jarrad Branthwaite, Vitalii Mykolenko; Ashley Young, James Garner, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Andre Gomes, Dwight McNeil; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.
Team_9 SUBS: Nathan Patterson, Michael Keane, Jack Harrison, João Virgínia, Beto, Ben Godfrey, Youssef Chermiti, Andy Lonergan, Lewis Warrington.
Team_6 (4-4-2): Arijanet Muric; Lorenz Assignon, Dara O’Shea, Maxime Esteve, Charlie Taylor; Lyle Foster, Josh Cullen, Sander Berge, Jacob Bruun Larsen; Wilson Odobert, David Datro Fofana.
Team_6 SUBS: Jack Cork, Johann Gudmundsson, Josh Brownhill, Jay Rodriguez, Benson Manuel, Vitinho, Zeki Amdouni, Lawrence Vigouroux, Hannes Delcroix.
Team_9 make four changes to the side that drew 1-1 with Team_15 in their last outing in the Premier League. Calvert-Lewin ended his 23-game run in all competitions without a goal and replaces Beto up front. Garner and Gomes come into the midfield, with Andre Onana and Idrissa Gueye out of the squad. Coleman captains the side and appears at right-back instead of Godfrey.
Team_6 make one alteration to the team that drew 1-1 with Team_20 in their last match. Assignon returns from suspension and replaces Vitinho at right-back.
Team_9 are looking to complete their first league double over Team_6 since 2018-19, having won 2-0 at Turf Moor in the reverse fixture. Both teams are on the pitch and are ready to get started.
Team_6 get this Premier League clash under way. Before the start, there was a round of applause for one minute for former Team_9 player Jimmy Husband.
Pickford is going long at every opportunity for Team_9 and is looking for Calvert-Lewin. The forward finds Doucoure, who lays a pass down the right to Coleman, but his cross is collected well by Muric.
Team_9 have had most of the possession in the early exchanges but are struggling to find a way through Team_6. Garner then gives away the ball with a loose pass, which allows the Clarets to race forward. However, the attack comes to nothing.
Pickford finds Coleman surging forward with a fanatic past down the right, with the full-back getting to the byline before looking for a cutback to Calvert-Lewin. However, Esteve gets across to poke it away.
CLOSE! There is some wrestling in the box, with the referee talking to the players before a corner is allowed to be taken on the right. McNeil's inswinging cross is dangerous, flashing it into the box but out for a goal-kick.
This is the third meeting between Team_9 and Team_6 in all competitions this season, with the Toffees winning 3-0 in the EFL Cup and 2-0 in the Premier League so far. The last time they beat a team three times in the same season while keeping a clean sheet each time was in 1995-96 against Blackburn. However, this is certainly the most important meeting, as it is a huge clash at the bottom of the league. It has shown with a cagey start, with neither side having a shot.
Garner shows some quick thinking to poke a loose ball through Taylor's legs, with the Team_6 man sliding in with a late tackle. Gomes sends the following free-kick into the box from a deep position, but the flag goes up for offside against Branthwaite.
Goodison Park was lively before the start, but it has quieted. The Team_9 fans haven’t had much to cheer for, but neither have Team_6. The Clarets have put some nice passing moves together. However, they haven’t put the home defence under any real pressure.
Branthwaite wins possession off Fofana with a good slide tackle and has space for a shot on the edge of the box. However, he drags his effort well wide of the right post. It would have probably been smarter to retain possession, but it has lifted the home fans in Goodison Park.
Mykolenko slides a clever throughball down the left to Doucoure, who gets to the byline before driving a cutback towards Calvert-Lewin. However, Muric dives across to claim it.
A very poor moment from Doucoure. McNeil gains possession in Team_6 half and drives forward with the ball before unleashing Doucoure, who is well offside. The Toffees would have had a chance to put the ball into the box if he held his run.
McNeil comes in from the right and looks for a shot on his left foot just outside the box, but his tame effort is blocked by O'Shea's foot.
CHANCE! Team_6 come forward for the first time through Foster, who gets into Team_9 box and wins a strong tackle on Mykolenko. His shot from a tight angle rebounds off a defender and to Taylor on the left. However, his powerful effort is blocked by Coleman.
Team_9 have lost nine of their last 14 Premier League home games against promoted sides (winning three and drawing two), as many defeats as they’d suffered in their previous 64 such games (winning 46 and drawing nine). They have been slightly better than Team_6 but are wasting too many chances through poor runs that have allowed the Clarets' defence to catch them offside.
Mykolenko's cross towards the edge of the box is flicked to Young by Calvert-Lewin. The Englishman waits for support before looking to slide a pass through to Doucoure but sends it straight out for a goal-kick. Audible frustrations from the home fans are growing.
CLOSE! Assignon has been one of the most exciting players on the pitch in what has been a cagey contest. He shows some brilliant feet to get past McNeil on the right before driving a low cross into the box, but Tarkowski and Pickford work together to clear it away.
Team_6 are starting to gain some confidence and are staying composed in possession. Foster and Assignon are combining down the right and are making things difficult for Team_9 defence. The Toffees are looking rushed, with Pickford clearing the ball straight out for a throw-in under little pressure.
Foster drives into the box and looks to play an unselfish pass across to Fofana, but Branthwaite dives across to intercept it.
Tarkowski lunges across  Esteve and gives away a free-kick in a promising shooting position for Team_6. Somehow, he gets away without a yellow card.
Bruun Larsen is over the free-kick on the left corner just outside the box, but he whips his effort across the goal and just over the bar. Pickford watched it all the way.
Tarkowski pulls Odobert as the Team_6 man races forward down the left and goes into the book.
McNeil and Taylor both go for the ball in the air, with the pair clashing heads. The referee immediately tells the medical team on the pitch, with McNeil struggling more than Taylor.
There is a stoppage in play, with McNeil needing medical assistance. The teams take some time to talk in the dugouts before the match restarts. McNeil is fine to continue.
Team_9 won seven of their first eight home Premier League games under Dyche when they scored the first goal (drawing one), only conceding one goal in those eight games. However, they have lost their last two when scoring first, losing both games 3-1 to Team_13 and Team_19. The first goal will be vital in this contest as there has been a lack of attacking quality. Team_9 have only created an xG of 0.05 compared to Team_6 0.18.
SAVE! Fofana gets onto a corner from the left and flicks his header on target, but the ball goes straight at Pickford, who makes a simple save.
Coleman and Odobert battle for the ball next to the right corner flag in Team_6 half, with nothing separating the pair before support comes from either side. Young then tries to win a corner by hitting the ball against a Team_6 player, but the assistant referee points for a goal-kick. Young is furious.
Gomes lofts a free-kick from the right into the box, with Fofana heading it away. Berge and Tarkowski get into a tussle behind the striker, with the Team_9 man hitting the floor. He holds his face but gets back to his feet when the attack is over.
BLOCK! Mykolenko bursts down the left before curling a cross into the box, ignoring Calvert-Lewin in the middle and instead searching for Young, who is free. However, his volley is blocked at close range.
Odobert gets past the halfway line and rushes beyond Gomes, who kicks his leg and goes into the book.
There will be two minutes of additional time.
GOALLLL! CALVERT-LEWIN SCORES! 1-0 Team_9! The hosts take a fortunate lead! Muric has possession on the edge of his own box but takes too long to pass the ball away. Calvert-Lewin gets in front of him and blocks the ball, with it looping over the goalkeeper and into the net.
HALF-TIME: Team_9 1-0 Team_6
Calvert-Lewin scored his second goal in two matches to give Team_9 a 1-0 lead over Team_6 heading into half-time at Goodison Park. It was a first 45 minutes that lacked any quality in the attack, with Branthwaite dragging a shot wide and McNeil and Young having shots blocked for the hosts. Taylor's powerful effort from inside the box was stopped by Coleman, with Bruun Larsen curling a free-kick over the bar and Fofana heading Team_6’s only shot on target of the half straight at Pickford. It looked like the score would be goalless at half-time before a massive mistake from Muric. He took too long in possession on the edge of his box, allowing Calvert-Lewin to block his pass, with the ball looping over his head and into the net.
That was a cagey first half that ended with a freak goal for Calvert-Lewin. The Toffees have only had one shot on target, with it coming from their goal seconds before the end. The hosts have created an xG of 0.3 from their five shots and didn’t look like scoring before Muric's mistake. As for Team_6, manager Kompany probably cannot believe the way that his side conceded in what is a huge contest at the bottom of the Premier League table. The Clarets have also disappointed going forward, registering an xG of 0.41 from their four shots, but will have to come from behind if they want to get anything out of this game. Odobert and Fofana have looked promising individually, but they must work better together up front if they want to put the Team_9 defence under pressure.
Team_9 get the ball rolling again. Team_6 must forget the mistake from Muric and focus on getting back into the match. Another defeat would see them remain six points behind 17th-placed Forest, who have a game in hand.
Calvert-Lewin wins an early free-kick on the right after getting tripped by Esteve. However, Gomes' right-footed cross is headed away, with  Mykolenko's ball into the box moments later wayward.
Since the start of last season, all nine of Team_9’s Premier League home wins have been to nil. They’ve drawn five and lost 17 of their last 22 at Goodison Park when conceding at least once, since a 3-2 win over Team_8 in May 2022.
Muric is getting some ironic cheers from the home fans every time he is in possession, with the goalkeeper making decisions much quicker since conceding just before the end of the first half. Once again, it has been a slow start, with neither side having a shot since the restart.
Team_6 have had most of the possession for the last couple of minutes, but most of it has been around the halfway line, which Team_9 have been happy with. The Clarets then go long, but Pickford collects it inside the box.
Team_6 haven’t won a match when they have been behind at half-time, drawing two and losing 15. It is admirable that Kompany wants to stick with his possession system, but there are certainly questions about whether it maximises their chances of winning games in a relegation battle.
Taylor gets down the right and curls a cross towards the back post, with Assignon doing well to head it back into the middle. However, a high foot in the middle allows Team_9 to regain possession.
CHANCE! Opportunity for Team_6 through Berge, who gets onto the end of a pass from left to right and surges into the box. However, his first touch is heavy, allowing  Branthwaite to slide across and poke it behind for a corner.
SAVE! What a chance for Calvert-Lewin to score again and put Team_9 in a brilliant position to collect all three points. Assignon gifts possession to Calvert-Lewin, who gets down the left side of the box and goes around O'Shea. The forward is one-on-one with Muric, but the goalkeeper makes himself big to stop the shot.
WIDE! Will Team_9 be punished for two missed chances? Young gets down the right and has time and space to put a cross into the box. He lifts it over to Doucoure at the back post, but he heads it wide from a narrow angle.
Fofana has been kept quiet by Branthwaite and is coming off for Vitinho.
McNeil surges forward with possession and has plenty of space in the middle of Team_6 half. He looks to slide a throughball into Calvert-Lewin, but O'Shea does brilliantly to get his body in the way and shield it back to Muric.
Cullen steams through the back of Gomes with a slide tackle and gives away a free-kick just outside Team_6 box. Gomes to take it.
Gomes is over the Team_9 free-kick just to the right outside Team_6 box, with the Clarets deciding not to make a wall. The Portuguese midfielder goes for goal from distance but whips his right-footed effort towards the top-right corner well over the bar.
RED CARD TO O'SHEA! Team_6 are down to 10 men after O'Shea is shown a straight red card. The defender takes a loose touch, with McNeil poking the ball away from him before being taken out by a slide tackle from the defender. He denied a clear goal-scoring opportunity!
Team_6 have had seven players sent off in the Premier League this season, more than any other team in the competition
Kompany makes a change immediately after O'Shea's red card. Bruun Larsen has looked quiet on the wing and is replaced by Brownhill, who should solidify the midfield.
CLOSE! Cullen has the ball on the edge of Team_9 box and rolls a pass through to Brownhill. He shifts possession onto his right foot before whipping his strike across the goal and just past the right post.
Team_6 have lost six of their eight Premier League away games against Team_9, winning the others in October 2017 (1-0) and March 2021 (2-1).
Calvert-Lewin drifts out to the right and is next to the touchline in Team_6 half. He skips past Esteve and arrives in the middle of the box before lashing his strike well wide of the target. A good run from the forward without the finish to match it.
Foster comes in from the right and looks to slide a reverse pass into the box and into the path of Cullen, but Branthwaite slides across to clear it behind for a corner. Team_6 are still having moments in this match.
SAVE! McNeil has possession on the left in Team_6 half and sends a throughball towards Calvert-Lewin, who is kept onside by Taylor. He gets to the byline and has a shot from a tight angle, but his chip is saved by Muric.
Calvert-Lewin ended an 18-game goalless run in the Premier League with his goal against Team_15. Before today, he last netted in consecutive games in September this season, while he has four in his last six against Team_6.
Some more good work from Foster on the left, who cuts inside before lifting a cross over to the back post, but a couple of Team_6 players get in the way of each other and Pickford claims a tame shot.
OVER! Calvert-Lewin holds onto the ball well outside Team_6 box and is not put under any pressure by the Clarets' defence. He then plays a short pass to McNeil, who takes a touch of his feet before curling a left-footed strike just over the top-left corner.
Pickford launches a long pass down the right to Calvert-Lewin, who battles with Berge but cannot get ahead of the midfielder. Berge then plays a pass back to Muric, who clears it away under pressure.
There is a swap on the right for Team_9, with Young coming off for Harrison.
Assignon looked bright on the right for Team_6 but is now coming off for experienced forward Rodriguez in an attacking change.
Odobert has been quiet since the restart and is being replaced by Guomunds­son.
Kompany is putting on another forward to put Team_9 under pressure in the last few minutes. Amdouni comes on for Taylor.
Team_9 make their first change. Calvert-Lewin scored the only goal just before half-time and is replaced by Beto, who started the last match.
Team_6 have put plenty of attackers onto the pitch, but they are not finding them. When the Clarets do go long with their passes, they are getting beat in the air by the Team_9 defence, which is taller and stronger.
PENALTY SHOUT! Beto races through the middle of the pitch and is in a battle with Berge, who gets a slight touch on the forward as he runs forward. Beto goes down and wants a penalty, but there was nowhere near enough contact. He should have had a shot!
Beto rolls past Berge on the left touchline, with the Team_6 man pulling his shirt back. He is then shown a yellow card. Team_9 are getting closer to securing a huge three points.
There will be five minutes of additional time. It looks like the game might be decided by Calvert-Lewin's fortunate goal just before half-time.
Team_6 are trying to work the perfect opportunity to score on the edge of Team_9 box, but they don’t have enough time. The Clarets then lose the ball, and Doucoure comes forward. He rolls a pass down the left to Beto, who tries to work a shot on his left foot. However, he is tackled by Esteve, who pokes it behind for a corner.
Team_6 are putting the pressure on in the final few seconds. Gudmundsson's cross flashes across the goal, with Berge collecting it on the other side. Another Clarets cross goes into the box, but Coleman heads it behind. However, it comes to nothing.
FULL-TIME: Team_9 1-0 Team_6
Calvert-Lewin scored a freak goal just before half-time to help Team_9 to a huge 1-0 win over relegation rivals Team_6 at Goodison Park. In a cagey match, it took a mistake from Muric to separate the two sides. He took too long in possession, with his pass bouncing off Calvert-Lewin, looping over his head and into the goal. He made up for his mistake with a big stop to deny the English forward in the second half before O'Shea was sent off for a late slide tackle on McNeil, denying the winger a goal-scoring opportunity. Calvert-Lewin went close again, but his effort from a narrow angle was saved, with Brownhill curling his strike across the goal and wide of the right post for the visitors. Team_6 needed to respond in the second half but only registered an xG of 0.05 from their two shots. Kompany's men are six points from safety and host Team_5 next. As for Team_9, their first win in 13 matches sees them jump above Team_4 and into 15th place. The Toffees travel to Team_7 for their upcoming Premier League match. That's all for today, goodbye."	"Arijanet Muric made another costly error as Team_6 saw a great chance to close in on Team_12 go begging in a 1-1 draw with Team_5.
A week on from making a calamitous mistake in Team_6’s defeat to Team_9, Muric was left red-faced again when he let a back-pass slip under his foot and roll into the net at Turf Moor.
That error came after Muric’s Team_5 counterpart Bart Verbruggen had seen his clearance charged down and turned in by Josh Brownhill.
But Team_5’s luck was in when Muric spared his opposite number’s blushes, a mistake that proved incredibly costly as a victory would have put Team_6 just four points from safety, with a crucial match at Team_17 next weekend. But now instead their chances of a great escape look increasingly slim.
How the match unfolded
Team_6 started with the greater intent and, just seven minutes in, there were big appeals for a penalty as Wilson Odobert fell under the challenge of Pervis Estupinan, yet referee Simon Hooper was unmoved.
Jacob Bruun Larsen drilled wide from a devilish Odobert centre, who was involved again when his shot strayed wide of the mark after he cut in sharply from the left.
Muric remained largely untroubled at the other end, though Team_6’s goalkeeper did have to react smartly to parry away Jakub Moder’s free-kick.
David Datro Fofana went close either side of half-time, failing to connect with Odobert’s cross before then sending a diving header left of Team_5’s goal.
Yet Team_6 had their breakthrough when Brownhill barrelled down Verbruggen with 16 minutes remaining.
The Clarets’ hopes of a morale-boosting win took a dent, though, when Muric let a routine pass divert from his control five minutes later, with the ball trickling home.
Fofana has enjoyed a fruitful loan spell from Team_7, but he can be quietly thankful that Muric’s mistake stole the limelight.
Despite enterprising wing-play from the excellent Odobert, Fofana just could not capitalise. 
He squandered a number of good chances and in a relegation scrap, goals are ultimately those fine margins that can keep a side’s safety hopes alive. Vincent Kompany’s team are running out of time.
A relatively routine end-of-season clash filtered into madness with two hapless goals in the final stages - both arriving through goalkeeping mishaps. 
Verbruggen found himself with a rare blot on his Team_5 resume, but his opposite number, Muric, made another mistake. Following a poor concession against Team_9 last week, Muric could only scramble back as the ball trickled over the line following his miscontrol to earn Team_5 a point which keeps them in 10th.

Team_10 have distanced themselves from the relegation zone with two wins in their last three. The Cottagers snatched three points at the death against Team_14 courtesy of Alex Iwobi's stoppage-time strike. Marco Silva's men were beaten in their last home game against Team_2, but did beat Team_3 in their previous match at the Cottage with a convincing 3-1 win. Another victory would carry them within striking distance of the top half.
Team_5 left it late to earn a point against Team_9 in their last Premier League outing. Lewis Dunk scored a late header to earn the Seagulls a share of the spoil at the Amex Stadium. Roberto De Zerbi's men failed to carry that resilience into their FA Cup clash with Team_20 during the week, suffering a 1-0 loss at Molineux. With one eye on their Europa League showdown with Roma next week, Team_5 will have to be at their best to avoid defeat today.

Team_5 (3-4-3): Jason Steele; Jan-Paul van Hecke, Lewis Dunk, Joel Veltman; Tariq Lamptey, Adam Webster, Carlos Balepa, Pervis Estupinan; Julio Enciso, Adam Lallana, Evan Ferguson.
Team_5 SUBS: Bart Verbruggen, Igor, Pascal Gross, Jakub Moder, Danny Welbeck, Valentin Barco, Simon Adingra, Ansu Fati.
Silva has named an unchanged side from the team that beat Team_14 last time out. Muniz continues to lead the line supported by Wilson, Pereir and Iwobi. Reed has been passed fit to start in the middle of the park. Willian returns to the bench after missing the win at Old Trafford.
Team_5 have made seven changes to the side that was beaten during the week by Team_20 in the FA Cup. Steele, Van Hecke, Dunk and Estupinan are the only players that remain from the loss. Veltman, Lamptey, Webster and Balepa come into the team at the back and in the midfield respectively. De Zerbi completely alters his side in the final third as Ferguson returns to spearhead the attack and is flanked by Enciso and Lallana.
A good omen for Team_10 ahead of the contest as they've never tasted defeat in their previous seven meetings with Team_5, including the 1-1 draw between the sides earlier this season.
We're under way at Craven Cottage.
Estupinan combines with Enciso on the edge of the Team_10 box and the latter cuts inside to shoot on his right foot, but Leno watches it into his hands.
Team_5 have looked to get their foot on the ball in the early stages of the game. They're not showing any ill effects of their midweek exploits.
Iwobi is played down the left flank into space and looks for the early cross into the middle. Veltman is well-positioned and blocks the delivery before clearing the danger.
Baleba pulls down Reed on the charge and goes into the book. An early caution for the Team_5 midfielder, he'll have to be careful now.
Pereira sends the resulting free-kick into the box that is deflected out to Reed. He shoots on the half-volley, but Steele makes a comfortable save.
Lallana wins the ball in the final third and has the chance to release Ferguson, but his offload sends the forward away from goal and the attack peters out.
Lamptey uses a turn of space to surge down the right flank. He combines with Enciso before lifting a cross into the middle for Ferguson to attack, but it just sails above his head.
Ferguson looks to apply pressure on Bassey at the back and catches the defender with a late challenge. He avoids a booking.
Team_5 look to break with pace, but Enciso is nudged to the deck by Reed on the half-way line. It has been a niggly game so far.
There have been no clear-cut openings yet. Both sides have fairly organised in their shape.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!! WILSON FIRES Team_10 AHEAD!!!!! 1-0!!!!! Wilson capitalises on great work from Muniz before finding the corner of the net with a left-footed strike. Team_10 go direct and Muniz wins the first header with Webster and then battles for the second to work it into the path of Wilson. Estupinan stumbles as he tries to get across, affording Wilson the time to pick his spot and beat Steele.
Muniz does brilliantly for Team_10 to create Wilson's goal. He attacks Bassey's long ball forward to beat Webster in the air. He follows his own knockdown to outmuscle the Team_5 defender to nod the ball to Wilson to collect and score.
Team_10 are unbeaten in 10 games after scoring the first goal in the Premier League this season, winning eight in the process.
OVER! Lallana turns away from his man in the Team_10 half and drives towards goal. He takes aim from the edge of the box, only to launch his effort over the top.
CHANCE! Van Hecke plays Enciso into space on the edge of the box and he turns his man inside out to create room for a left-footed strike. He connects well with his effort, but sends it narrowly over the top.
Baleba drives forward and looks to thread a pass through to Ferguson, but Bassey gets across to make an important interception.
Muniz causes problems again in the final third as he gets the better of Webster, but he loses possession before he can pull the trigger.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!! MUNIZ MAKES IT TWO!!!! 2-0 Team_10! Muniz heads home from close range as Wilson returns the favour from the opener. Wilson is afforded space and time on the right flank and he angles a perfect ball into the middle. Muniz times his run to perfection and steers his header into the left corner away from Steele.
Wilson takes a step inside on his left foot on the right flank and arcs a cross towards the six-yard box for Muniz to attack and score.
Estupinan plays Lallana down the left flank and he floats a cross into the box. Enciso attempts to attack the ball, but he gets his effort all wrong by blazing it over.
Lamptey draws a foul from Robinson down the right flank, but Leno punches the resulting free-kick from Enciso away from danger.
A concern for Team_10 as Muniz goes down in a heap after being on the receiving end of a strong challenge from Estupinan. He requires treatment on the pitch.
Muniz appears to be okay to continue after treatment, although Silva will be concerned, especially after his brilliant opening 40 minutes.
Team_5 are attempting to get back into the game by pressing deep into Team_10 half, but are lacking a cutting edge at the moment.
Ferguson drives into the Team_10 box and goes for a low drive across the face of goal that Lallana fails to connect with as the ball travels behind for a goal-kick.
Van Hecke battles for the ball following an Enciso free-kick, but as he stretches to steer an effort towards goal, the offside flag is raised.
There will be four minutes of added time.
Lallana tries to press Reed in possession but gives away a free-kick. Team_5 have not been at their best in the first half.
HALF-TIME: Team_10 2-0 Team_5
Team_10 take a 2-0 lead into the break in their Premier League clash with Team_5. The home side are good value for their lead and have been clinical in the final third. Rodrigo Muniz and Harry Wilson have combined for the two goals. Muniz battled for possession to tee up Wilson for the opener before the Welshman returned the favour with a pinpoint cross for the forward to head home. Marco Silva's men are in complete control.
Team_5 have lacked the clinical edge shown by the hosts in the final third. The Seagulls have created a couple of decent openings, but have failed to test Bernd Leno. Roberto De Zerbi's men are always full of effort and will not give up without a fight here, but they need to improve.
Fati enters the action to replace Enciso, who had been an active presence in the first half.
De Zerbi responds at the break as Adingra replaces Lamptey. The Seagulls boss wants extra firepower in the final third.
We're back under way at Craven Cottage.
Estupinan drives down the left flank and wins a corner. From the resulting set-piece Dunk rises in the middle, but plants his header straight at Leno.
Robinson has space to roam down the left flank for the hosts. He looks to dig out a cross, but Veltman blocks the delivery and clears the follow-up.
CHANCE! Pereira releases Wilson through on goal, but the Wales international has to take on the strike early on his right foot. He places his effort narrowly wide of the left post.
Muniz gets the better of Webster in a battle of strength down the right. He fends off the defender before sending a low ball towards the near post that Estupinan diverts away from Wilson on the slide.
PEREIRA HAS TO SCORE! Pereira is played through on goal by Iwobi and only has Steele to beat. Wilson arrives in support, but Pereira dwells on his strike and allows Dunk to get back. Between Dunk and Steele, the duo do enough to delay the strike before Pereira eventually curls an effort wide of the right post.
Iwobi uses the space in the Team_5 half once more with another fine pass to pick out Robinson. The full-back has team-mates in the box, but he drills his cross at Steele.
Estupinan grapples with Muniz and brings down the forward. He goes into the book and is not happy with the decision.
INCHES WIDE! Lallana plays Ferguson through with a sublime pass and he only has Leno to beat. He flicks the ball past the Team_10 keeper, but his effort trickles the wrong side of the right post.
Lallana could have had an assist with his final act, and his now replaced by Buonanotte for the final third of the game.
An attacking change from De Zerbi as he withdraws Dunk for Gross. Van Hecke moves into central defence.
SAVE! Muniz fires an effort into the side-netting and Steele then plays the ball straight out from the goal-kick. However, Wilson makes a sliding interception and it allows Pereira to line up a strike that the Team_5 keeper saves. Almost a howler from Steele.
FERGUSON MISSES ANOTHER SITTER! The forward is played through on goal in the inside-right channel. He only has to beat Leno, but he fires a tame effort at the keeper.
The Seagulls are growing with confidence now and are beginning to exert real pressure on the Team_10 backline.
Gross and Ferguson combine in the final third to tee up Buonanotte. He tries to weave his way past Bassey, but he takes one too many touches.
Webster makes an important block to deny Wilson at the near post following another dangerous cross from Iwobi.
Iwobi is withdrawn after an impressive second half where he could have had a couple of assists. Willian replaces him on the left flank.
Pereira should have effectively ended the game, missing a glorious opening. Cairney replaces him in the middle of the park.
Team_5 are seeing a lot of the ball and are creating chances. A goal back for the visitors would make life very interesting in the closing stages.
Team_10 are showing why they're unbeaten after scoring the first goal this season. The Cottagers have managed to keep a good attacking side at bay.
Baleba arrives late in the box to attack Estupinan's cross, only to plant his header over the top.
Fati tries an acrobatic effort from Ferguson's knockdown, but he fails to connect with his strike. It has been the story of Team_5 afternoon.
Baleba makes way for the Seagulls after an ineffectual game and is replaced by Moder.
OFF THE POST! Buonanotte latches onto Fati's pass from the deck and takes a neat touch. He places a low effort towards goal on his left foot, only to be denied by the post.
Fati collects the ball at the back post and lines up a strike from the angle, only to see his effort saved by Leno with strong hands.
Team_5 are running out of time here. The Seagulls have had their chances in the second half, but have been wasteful in front of goal, Ferguson more than most.
Wilson was outstanding in the first half to score and notch an assist. He makes way for Traore.
Muniz has been Team_10 key man this afternoon. He bullied Webster to create the first and scored a fine header for the second. Broja replaces the forward for the final six minutes.
Moder sends a cutback across the box that reaches Fati in the inside-left channel, who sends a tame effort straight at Leno.
De Cordova-Reid is on for Lukic in the closing stages. Lukic had a strong outing in the middle of the park.
De Cordova-Reid is booked for time-wasting stopping a quick free-kick from the visitors.
Leno has to be alert to turn Adingra's deflected cross behind for a corner as it appeared to be looping towards the top-right corner.
GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!! TRAORE ENDS THE GAME!!!! 3-0 Team_10!!!! Traore produces a clinical finish on the counter to end the game. De Cordova-Reid breaks forward after Team_5 lose possession and he plays a perfect pass to release the winger into space. Traore holds his composure with a low strike that finds the back of the net.
De Cordova-Reid makes a bursting run and plays a well-timed pass to Traore, who does the rest with a fine finish.
Buonanotte finds the back of the net for the visitors, but the flag goes up for offside. It has been that sort of day for the Seagulls.
FULL-TIME: Team_10 3-0 Team_5
Team_10 make it three wins from four in the Premier League with a 3-0 victory over Team_5 to move within three points of the top half and more importantly 15 points clear of the relegation zone. The Cottagers did the damage in the first half as Rodrigo Muniz and Harry Wilson scored and created goals for one another. The Seagulls had ample opportunities to get back into the contest, but Evan Ferguson spurned two glorious openings. Adama Traore came off the bench to wrap up the three points for the hosts. Team_10 travel to face Team_20 in their next Premier League outing next week, while Team_5 are on the road against Roma on Thursday in the Europa League. Thanks for joining us today. Until next time, goodbye."	"AFC Team_3 achieved one of the greatest turnarounds in Premier League history as they battled back from 3-0 down at half-time to beat Team_12 4-3, stopping their visitors from escaping the relegation zone.
Tahith Chong, Chiedozie Ogbene and Ross Barkley gave Luton a seemingly unassailable lead at the break, but Dominic Solanke and Ilya Zabarnyi started the second-half comeback, before Antoine Semenyo struck twice to send the home fans into rapture.
It is the first time in 21 years that a Premier League team have come from 3-0 down to win, and only the fifth time it has ever happened in the competition. 
Luton appeared to be cruising to a win that would have taken them out of the relegation zone, but instead they remain three points behind Team_16 ahead of a HUGE match between the clubs at Kenilworth Road this Saturday. Team_3 are now 14 points above the bottom three, in 13th place.
This fixture had been abandoned on 16 December in the 59th minute after Luton captain Tom Lockyer suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch. Lockyer was at the game tonight to meet and thank the medics who saved his life.
In an act of kindness due to the fixture being rearranged, Team_3 fans raised money and subsidised the travel for Luton’s supporters.
Andoni Iraola made three changes as Alex Scott, Dango Ouattara and Luis Sinisterra started ahead of Marcus Tavernier, Justin Kluivert and Milos Kerkez. Rob Edwards made just one change to his starting XI as Daiki Hashioka replaced Gabriel Osho.
Luton took the lead after just nine minutes through Chong, who got on the end of Jordan Clark’s cross and headed past Neto at close range.
Luton have now scored in 16 consecutive Premier League matches, the second-longest run by a promoted club in the competition’s history after Team_15 scored in 20 successive matches in 1993/94.
Sinisterra forced two saves from Thomas Kaminski at the other end, but Luton doubled their lead against the run of play just after the half-hour mark as Alfie Doughty got in behind and delivered a low cross to Ogbene, who applied a simple finish at the far post.
It was 3-0 on the stroke of half-time as Luton hit Team_3 with another counter-attack, this time Barkley finishing the move with a powerful strike for his 50th goal in English football. The Hatters scored with all three of their shots on target in the first half.
Iraola responded with a double change at half-time as Enes Unal and Tavernier replaced Scott and Sinisterra, and his switches quickly paid off. Team_3 pulled a goal back within five minutes of the restart after brilliant individual play from Solanke. He showed great strength and skill to shield the ball from Hashioka before flicking the ball past him and chipping the ball over Kaminski.
Chong had the ball in the net for the second time in the match when he got on the end of a rebound after a great save from Neto to deny Carlton Morris, but the forward was in an offside position.
Instead, Zabarnyi scored his first goal for Team_3 to put Luton under serious pressure. His 62nd-minute header looped into the goal despite a desperate effort from Doughty to try and clear it off the line.
Two minutes later Team_3 levelled the scores as Semenyo cut inside past Hashioka and smashed the ball in at the near post."
