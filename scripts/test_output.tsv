Burnley	Manchester City	https://www.fotmob.com/matches/burnley-vs-manchester-city/2ai7j8#4193450:tab=ticker	Burnley kick us off, and we are underway in what promises to be another thrilling campaign! De Bruyne wins an early corner as City look to quiet the lively home crowd with an opening goal. Burnley fans and players scream for a penalty as Amdouni goes down under the challenge of Akanji, but the referee waves away the protests before a VAR review confirms no spot-kick will be awarded. It is far from the ideal start for Kompany and the Clarets, who find themselves a goal down against the defending champions. Can they respond? De Bruyne whips a dangerous ball into the box, and Haaland is there to meet it at the back post. It is at an awkward height, though, and the striker can only volley high over the crossbar. Haaland – who scored twice in City's opening Premier League game last season – scored a hat-trick in his only previous game against Burnley, a 6-0 win in last season's FA Cup quarter-final. It took him only four minutes to net here in the opening game for the Citizens for a second campaign in a row. Trafford makes a brilliant stop to deny Rodri's header after Burnley were caught out at a set-piece situation, though a delayed flag goes up for offside and the goal would not have counted anyway. Amdouni gives Ederson his first test of the contest, though the City goalkeeper is able to get down and save the low shot with relative ease. City have had 69.7 per cent of the possession so far, but Burnley are certainly showing no signs of being overawed and have exhibited some neat attacking play themselves. Guardiola may be forced into an early change, and it would be an especially damaging one too as De Bruyne clutches at his hamstring. Haaland has now contributed to at least one goal in his last seven Premier League away games (seven goals, one assist). Rodri makes a vital interception to nip the ball away from Amdouni after Lewis gave possession away in a dangerous situation. That is a huge let-off for the youngster. Burnley have won just one of their last 23 league matches against Manchester City (D6 L16) and have lost the last eight in a row by an aggregate score of 26-1. They have responded well to going behind here, though. City are just enjoying a spell of possession as they try to slow the momentum their hosts had built up in recent minutes. Some brilliant interplay between Kovacic and Foden takes the latter into a dangerous position in the Burnley box, but Trafford does brilliantly to race out of his goal and snuff out the chance for a shot. Burnley will feel hard done by to be two behind, but City have been magnificently ruthless. Two shots on target and two goals for the Citizens, who are surely on their way to three points to kick off the season. In all competitions, City have won 11 games in a row against Burnley, scoring 40 goals and conceding just one. They beat them 6-0 in the FA Cup last season, inflicting the Clarets' heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 to City themselves in March 1999 in a league game. Having responded well to City's first goal, the second does seem to have knocked the wind out of Burnley's sails and the home crowd have certainly quietened. It may be a case of getting to the break just the two goals down to regroup and go again in the second 45 minutes. There will be five minutes of additional time at the end of this first half. Burnley have won their opening game in just two of their eight previous Premier League seasons (D1 L5), winning 3-2 at reigning champions Chelsea in 2017-18 and 3-0 at home to Southampton in 2019-20. City get us back underway for the second period. City have won their opening Premier League game in 12 of the last 14 seasons, with both exceptions coming against Tottenham (0-0 in 2010-11, 0-1 in 2021-22). They look on their way to another victory to kick off the season here. O'Shea makes an important intervention to nip in and take the ball off the toes of Haaland after Silva tried to feed the striker. Haaland races onto Alvarez's throughball but the pass takes him wide, and O'Shea does well to race back and block the forward's eventual shot behind for a corner. The Clarets will have to produce more going forward if they are to make an unlikely comeback, accumulating just 0.23 xG (expected goals) to this point. A sweeping City move sees them carve Burnley open again. Haaland lays the ball to his right for Alvarez, but the Argentina international's first touch takes him wide and his drive ends up flying well wide of the right post. What impact will those changes have on the hosts' attacking efforts? Burnley's last shot came all the way back in the 37th minute. For all of their impressive work, they have just lacked a little in the final third in this game. Rodri marauds forwards and space looks to have opened up for him to smash towards goal. He just seems hesitant to pull the trigger, though, and by the time he finally does, a Burnley defender is well-placed to block his drive. With 20 minutes to play, can City see the remainder of the game out for three points to kick off what they hope will be another successful defence of their Premier League crown? Foden tries to pick out Haaland in lots of space in the box, but he gets the cross wrong and it flies well out of his striker's reach. With the result surely beyond doubt, it appears Guardiola will look to shake it up by making substitutes. Burnley lost just one home league game in 2022-23 (W16 D6), going down 2-1 against QPR in April. However, as a Premier League side they have lost five of their last eight at Turf Moor, and they look on course for another defeat here. Alvarez stings the palms of Trafford with a fierce drive, though the goalkeeper deals with it well. Rodri's strike has capped an excellent performance, pulling the strings for the Citizens with an assist and a goal while leading his team in final third entries (14) and touches (88). The fourth official puts up his board and indicates there will be six minutes of additional time at the end of this game. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Burnley and Manchester City at Turf Moor. The Premier League is back for a new season, and it gets underway with an intriguing match-up between a newly promoted side and the reigning champions. Burnley could have hardly been given a tougher opening fixture, but they should come into it with confidence after cruising to the Championship title last time out in their first season back in the second tier. Led by Vincent Kompany, a Citizens' legend from his playing career, Burnley reached 101 points and secured promotion with seven games to play, and they will be hoping to get off the mark with a positive result on home soil. City, meanwhile, claimed a historic treble last term, finally winning their first Champions League title while also taking Premier League and FA Cup glory. It has been a transfer window of change with key players of recent years such as Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan leaving the club, but they still come into this campaign expected to be frontrunners and they will be looking to get off to a winning start as they bid for a sixth Premier League crown in seven seasons. BURNLEY (4-4-2): James Trafford; Connor Roberts, Dara O'Shea, Ameen Al Dakhil, Jordan Beyer; Luca Koleosho, Sander Berge, Josh Cullen, Vitinho; Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Lyle Foster. SUBS: Josh Brownhill, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Arijanet Muric, Manuel Benson, Anass Zaroury, Jack Cork, Nathan Redmond, Hjalmar Ekdal, Johann Gudmundsson. MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake, Rico Lewis; Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland. SUBS: Aymeric Laporte, Kalvin Phillips, Cole Palmer, James McAtee, Sergio Gomez, Stefan Ortega Moreno, Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol, Jack Grealish. Kompany includes six new signings as Trafford, signed from City in this window, starts between the sticks while O'Shea comes into the back four alongside Al Dakhil, who has had his loan move made permanent after impressing last season. Berge, Koleosho and Amdouni are the other fresh faces set to play from the off. In contrast, Pep Guardiola opts to leave his new arrivals on the bench as Gvardiol and Kovacic will be made to wait for their competitive City debuts. Key defenders John Stones and Ruben Dias both miss out through injury while Grealish is on the bench. Lewis starts and so does Alvarez, charged with supporting the prolific Haaland in attack. The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of the opening Premier League game of the season! The half-time whistle blows as City take a 2-0 lead into the break after a ruthless display in the opening period. They were ahead after just four minutes, Haaland opening his account for the season by smashing home from Rodri's clever headed assist. Burnley responded well to going 1-0 down and could have levelled through Koleosho and then Foster, but they would go two goals behind before the break as Haaland curled home superbly from Alvarez's lay-off to leave the champions very much in the ascendancy at the interval. Burnley are in an unfamiliar situation having been so dominant in the Championship last season, but Kompany will remain encouraged by his team's first-half performance despite the scoreline. It would take an almighty effort to recover anything from this game though, facing a side who are unbeaten in their last 44 Premier League games when leading at half-time, failing to win just three of those. City's Premier League title defence is off to a winning start as they claim a comfortable 3-0 triumph over newly promoted Burnley at Turf Moor. They were set on their way to victory just four minutes in, Haaland thumping home Rodri's neat assist before the prolific striker made it 2-0 before the break with a sublime curling finish. It was a long way back for the Clarets, and any hopes of an unlikely turnaround were ended 15 minutes from time when Rodri smashed into the back of the net after a free-kick caused havoc in the Burnley penalty area. Things got even worse for the hosts in the dying seconds as Zaroury initially received a yellow card for a foul on Walker, only for a VAR review to adjudge the tackle to be worthy of a sending-off as City run out easy victors. The first Premier League game of the season goes the way of the champions, moving them top of the league ahead of the rest of the opening round of fixtures this weekend. That is a position they will attempt not to relinquish in their bid for a sixth league title in seven seasons. For Kompany and Burnley, they will be encouraged by a decent performance, if not the result, in a fixture that will be one of the hardest they play all season.
