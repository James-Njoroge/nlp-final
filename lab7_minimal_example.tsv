93323	Team_3	Team_19	2023-08-12	Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth	52899.0	Robert Jones	Exciting	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_6 and Team_13 at Turf Moor.
The Premier League is back for a new season, and it gets underway with an intriguing match-up between a newly promoted side and the reigning champions. Team_6 could have hardly been given a tougher opening fixture, but they should come into it with confidence after cruising to the Championship title last time out in their first season back in the second tier. Led by Vincent Kompany, a Citizens' legend from his playing career, Team_6 reached 101 points and secured promotion with seven games to play, and they will be hoping to get off the mark with a positive result on home soil.
City, meanwhile, claimed a historic treble last term, finally winning their first Champions League title while also taking Premier League and FA Cup glory. It has been a transfer window of change with key players of recent years such as Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan leaving the club, but they still come into this campaign expected to be frontrunners and they will be looking to get off to a winning start as they bid for a sixth Premier League crown in seven seasons.
Team_6 (4-4-2): James Trafford; Connor Roberts, Dara O'Shea, Ameen Al Dakhil, Jordan Beyer; Luca Koleosho, Sander Berge, Josh Cullen, Vitinho; Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Lyle Foster.
SUBS: Josh Brownhill, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Arijanet Muric, Manuel Benson, Anass Zaroury, Jack Cork, Nathan Redmond, Hjalmar Ekdal, Johann Gudmundsson.
Team_13 (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake, Rico Lewis; Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland.
SUBS: Aymeric Laporte, Kalvin Phillips, Cole Palmer, James McAtee, Sergio Gomez, Stefan Ortega Moreno, Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol, Jack Grealish.
Kompany includes six new signings as Trafford, signed from City in this window, starts between the sticks while O'Shea comes into the back four alongside Al Dakhil, who has had his loan move made permanent after impressing last season. Berge, Koleosho and Amdouni are the other fresh faces set to play from the off.
In contrast, Pep Guardiola opts to leave his new arrivals on the bench as Gvardiol and Kovacic will be made to wait for their competitive City debuts. Key defenders John Stones and Ruben Dias both miss out through injury while Grealish is on the bench. Lewis starts and so does Alvarez, charged with supporting the prolific Haaland in attack.
The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of the opening Premier League game of the season!
Team_6 kick us off, and we are underway in what promises to be another thrilling campaign!
De Bruyne wins an early corner as City look to quiet the lively home crowd with an opening goal.
GOAL!!! HAALAND PUTS CITY AHEAD!!! Having netted 36 Premier League goals last season, it has taken just four minutes for him to open his account for this campaign. It is a typical Haaland goal as he lurks in the box while De Bruyne lofts a deep cross for Rodri. The midfielder nods it back across, and the Norway international is waiting to smash home and put the champions 1-0 up!
Rodri's header was clever to put it on a plate for Haaland, who finished with typical aplomb.
Team_6 fans and players scream for a penalty as Amdouni goes down under the challenge of Akanji, but the referee waves away the protests before a VAR review confirms no spot-kick will be awarded.
It is far from the ideal start for Kompany and the Clarets, who find themselves a goal down against the defending champions. Can they respond?
De Bruyne whips a dangerous ball into the box, and Haaland is there to meet it at the back post. It is at an awkward height, though, and the striker can only volley high over the crossbar.
Haaland – who scored twice in City's opening Premier League game last season – scored a hat-trick in his only previous game against Team_6, a 6-0 win in last season's FA Cup quarter-final. It took him only four minutes to net here in the opening game for the Citizens for a second campaign in a row.
Team_6 work the ball nicely into the visitors' penalty area, and it eventually ends up at the feet of Koleosho. The 18-year-old tries to pick out the far corner, but he gets well underneath his effort and Ederson watches it soar over his crossbar. That was better from Kompany's side, though.
Trafford makes a brilliant stop to deny Rodri's header after Team_6 were caught out at a set-piece situation, though a delayed flag goes up for offside and the goal would not have counted anyway.
Amdouni gives Ederson his first test of the contest, though the City goalkeeper is able to get down and save the low shot with relative ease.
City have had 69.7 per cent of the possession so far, but Team_6 are certainly showing no signs of being overawed and have exhibited some neat attacking play themselves.
Guardiola may be forced into an early change, and it would be an especially damaging one too as De Bruyne clutches at his hamstring.
De Bruyne does indeed limp off, and Kovacic comes on in his place for his City debut.
Haaland has now contributed to at least one goal in his last seven Premier League away games (seven goals, one assist).
Rodri makes a vital interception to nip the ball away from Amdouni after Lewis gave possession away in a dangerous situation. That is a huge let-off for the youngster.
Foster cuts in on his right foot and tries to curl into the far corner, but he cannot get enough bend on his effort and it flies wide of the post. Team_6 are looking lively when they come forward.
Team_6 have won just one of their last 23 league matches against Team_13 (D6 L16) and have lost the last eight in a row by an aggregate score of 26-1. They have responded well to going behind here, though.
City are just enjoying a spell of possession as they try to slow the momentum their hosts had built up in recent minutes.
Some brilliant interplay between Kovacic and Foden takes the latter into a dangerous position in the Team_6 box, but Trafford does brilliantly to race out of his goal and snuff out the chance for a shot.
GOAL!!! HAALAND AGAIN!!! It is a quite brilliant finish to put City 2-0 up, perhaps against the run of play, as he receives the ball in the box from Alvarez. He opts to shoot first-time, and he curls superbly into the top left corner, kissing the crossbar and going in to put his team in control at Turf Moor.
Alvarez's lay-off was perfectly weighted for Haaland to arrow home.
Team_6 will feel hard done by to be two behind, but City have been magnificently ruthless. Two shots on target and two goals for the Citizens, who are surely on their way to three points to kick off the season.
In all competitions, City have won 11 games in a row against Team_6, scoring 40 goals and conceding just one. They beat them 6-0 in the FA Cup last season, inflicting the Clarets' heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 to City themselves in March 1999 in a league game.
Having responded well to City's first goal, the second does seem to have knocked the wind out of Team_6 sails and the home crowd have certainly quietened. It may be a case of getting to the break just the two goals down to regroup and go again in the second 45 minutes.
There will be five minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Team_6 have won their opening game in just two of their eight previous Premier League seasons (D1 L5), winning 3-2 at reigning champions Team_7 in 2017-18 and 3-0 at home to Southampton in 2019-20.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 0-2 Team_13
The half-time whistle blows as City take a 2-0 lead into the break after a ruthless display in the opening period. They were ahead after just four minutes, Haaland opening his account for the season by smashing home from Rodri's clever headed assist. Team_6 responded well to going 1-0 down and could have levelled through Koleosho and then Foster, but they would go two goals behind before the break as Haaland curled home superbly from Alvarez's lay-off to leave the champions very much in the ascendancy at the interval.
Team_6 are in an unfamiliar situation having been so dominant in the Championship last season, but Kompany will remain encouraged by his team's first-half performance despite the scoreline. It would take an almighty effort to recover anything from this game though, facing a side who are unbeaten in their last 44 Premier League games when leading at half-time, failing to win just three of those.
City get us back underway for the second period.
City have won their opening Premier League game in 12 of the last 14 seasons, with both exceptions coming against Team_18 (0-0 in 2010-11, 0-1 in 2021-22). They look on their way to another victory to kick off the season here.
O'Shea makes an important intervention to nip in and take the ball off the toes of Haaland after Silva tried to feed the striker.
Haaland races onto Alvarez's throughball but the pass takes him wide, and O'Shea does well to race back and block the forward's eventual shot behind for a corner.
Rodri lets fly with a fierce effort from 30 yards out, and Trafford is forced to tip it over his crossbar for a corner. The City midfielder then gets his head on the end of the resulting set-piece, but Trafford is again equal to it and gathers down to his right.
The Clarets will have to produce more going forward if they are to make an unlikely comeback, accumulating just 0.23 xG (expected goals) to this point.
A sweeping City move sees them carve Team_6 open again. Haaland lays the ball to his right for Alvarez, but the Argentina international's first touch takes him wide and his drive ends up flying well wide of the right post.
Kompany looks to his bench, first introducing Bruun Larsen for his Team_6 debut in place of Koleosho.
Zaroury also comes on for Amdouni.
What impact will those changes have on the hosts' attacking efforts?
Team_6 last shot came all the way back in the 37th minute. For all of their impressive work, they have just lacked a little in the final third in this game.
Rodri marauds forwards and space looks to have opened up for him to smash towards goal. He just seems hesitant to pull the trigger, though, and by the time he finally does, a Team_6 defender is well-placed to block his drive.
With 20 minutes to play, can City see the remainder of the game out for three points to kick off what they hope will be another successful defence of their Premier League crown?
Foden tries to pick out Haaland in lots of space in the box, but he gets the cross wrong and it flies well out of his striker's reach.
Beyer limps off for Benson.
GOAL!!! RODRI SURELY KILLS IT OFF!!! After City were awarded a free-kick for Al Dakhil bundling over Haaland, Foden's set-piece delivery causes havoc in the Team_6 box as they fail to clear their lines. It sits up nicely for Rodri to hit, and he coolly smashes home to make it 3-0 to the visitors and surely end any hopes of a Clarets comeback.
With the result surely beyond doubt, it appears Guardiola will look to shake it up by making substitutes.
Guardiola does indeed make changes, first bringing on Gvardiol for his City debut as Lewis makes way.
Ake is replaced by Laporte.
Haaland will not get a hat-trick to start the season as his outing is over. Palmer is on in his place.
Team_6 lost just one home league game in 2022-23 (W16 D6), going down 2-1 against QPR in April. However, as a Premier League side they have lost five of their last eight at Turf Moor, and they look on course for another defeat here.
Alvarez stings the palms of Trafford with a fierce drive, though the goalkeeper deals with it well.
Rodri's strike has capped an excellent performance, pulling the strings for the Citizens with an assist and a goal while leading his team in final third entries (14) and touches (88).
The fourth official puts up his board and indicates there will be six minutes of additional time at the end of this game.
Berge makes way for Brownhill.
Redmond enters the fray for Foster.
Zaroury brings down Walker with a sliding challenge, receiving the first yellow of the contest. However, VAR is checking for a potential red card, and Zaroury may be in further trouble...
ZAROURY IS SENT OFF!!! The replays show the substitute's right foot catches Walker high on his left leg, and a VAR review rules the tackle is worthy of a red card. Team_6 are down to 10 men!
Walker, just involved in the incident that saw Zaroury given his marching orders, makes way for McAtee.
FULL-TIME: Team_6 0-3 Team_13
City's Premier League title defence is off to a winning start as they claim a comfortable 3-0 triumph over newly promoted Team_6 at Turf Moor. They were set on their way to victory just four minutes in, Haaland thumping home Rodri's neat assist before the prolific striker made it 2-0 before the break with a sublime curling finish. It was a long way back for the Clarets, and any hopes of an unlikely turnaround were ended 15 minutes from time when Rodri smashed into the back of the net after a free-kick caused havoc in the Team_6 penalty area. Things got even worse for the hosts in the dying seconds as Zaroury initially received a yellow card for a foul on Walker, only for a VAR review to adjudge the tackle to be worthy of a sending-off as City run out easy victors.
The first Premier League game of the season goes the way of the champions, moving them top of the league ahead of the rest of the opening round of fixtures this weekend. That is a position they will attempt not to relinquish in their bid for a sixth league title in seven seasons. For Kompany and Team_6, they will be encouraged by a decent performance, if not the result, in a fixture that will be one of the hardest they play all season.

The opening weekend of the Premier League continues with reigning champions Team_13 setting the early tempo with a commanding 3-0 win over Team_6 on Friday. Team_1 will aim to follow suit as they look to launch their title challenge against the side that ended their pursuit last season.
Team_1 (4-3-3): Aaron Ramsdale; Thomas Partey, Ben White, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBS: Karl Hein, Gabriel Magalhaes, Emile Smith Rowe, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson.
Team_16 (3-4-3): Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall, Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Ryan Yates, Orel Mangala, Ola Aina; Danilo, Brennan Johnson, Morgan Gibbs-White.
SUBS: Ethan Horvath, Neco Williams, Cheikhou Kouyate, Taiwo Awoniyi, Chris Wood, Moussa Niakhite, Anthony Elanga, Remo Freuler, Lewis O'Brien.
Mikel Arteta makes just a single change from last weekend's Community Shield victory - albeit a hugely intriguing one with Nketiah replacing Gabriel, who drops to the bench. In a subsequent tactical reshuffle, White moves across into the heart of defence with Thomas starting at right-back. Havertz moves into an attacking three-man midfield alongside Odegaard and Rice, with Nketiah leading the line.
Meanwhile, Matt Turner starts in goal in the week he joined Forest from Team_1. The former Gunner is one of two new signings named in Steve Cooper's starting line-up along with Aina, who joined on a free transfer. Interestingly, there is no place for Awoniyi, who enjoyed a strong finish to last season - scoring the winner against Team_1 in May.
It is not the first time the two sides are meeting on the opening weekend of a Premier League season. Indeed, they did the same a quarter of a century ago, Marc Overmars scoring the winner as Team_1 prevailed 2-1 at Highbury.
Kick-off has been delayed by 30 minutes due to an issue at the turnstiles. Stay tuned for further updates.
The stadium is gradually filling up with plenty of fans now taking their seats. We should not be too far from starting here.
Later than planned, but the players are finally making their way out onto the field. Kick-off at the Emirates is moments away.
Michael Oliver is today's referee. He blows his whistle and Forest get the match under way.
Both sides will be looking to address their respective form from last season. Team_1 kept just four Premier League clean sheets on home soil, while Forest had the worst away record in the division - winning just one of 19 matches and registered just eight points.
Team_1 quickly settling into their rhythm and Saka earns a corner via Aina's deflection. But Forest deal with two deliveries into their box.
The Gunners are unbeaten in each of their last nine home league meetings with Forest, winning five and drawing four.
Saka cuts inside from the right wing and seeks out Nketiah with a clever reverse pass. However, it is just lacking the required accuracy and Turner comes out to collect.
Today, Forest are aiming to end a run of four successive opening-day defeats. Although, the start to the game suggests they face a tough task in breaking the streak.
CHANCE! Johnson must do better! Against the run of play, Forest are in behind Team_1, who went to sleep at the back. Johnson is all on his own as he latches onto Boly's header and beats Ramsdale, but cannot keep his shot on target.
At the other end, Odegaard threads a neat throughball looking for Nketiah. Turner is quickly out to smother the ball, though the Team_1 forward is subsequently ruled offside.
Forest's lacking of a clinical edge was evident with that Johnson opportunity going begging. They only scored three times during pre-season and failed to find the net in each of their final four warm-up matches.
Team_1 continuing to enjoy most of the possession in their opening match of the season. But the Gunners must look to record more attempts on goal.
We are still goalless inside the opening 20 minutes at the Emirates, where Team_1 have fond memories of their last two meetings with Forest. Indeed, both culminated in commanding 5-0 victories for the Gunners. More of the same today would do very nicely for the hosts.
An anxious moment for Forest as Turner's attempted clearance is charged down by Nketiah. Thankfully for the visitors, the ball ricochets well wide of the target, but their hearts will have momentarily been in their mouths.
Forest are trying to gain a foothold in the contest having enjoyed just over 13 per cent of the possession so far. But they just cannot keep the ball from their opponents for long enough at the moment.
The anticipation rises inside the Emirates as Saka has space in the penalty area. His attempted cross ricochets behind off McKenna. Can the hosts make the most of this opportunity?
NKETIAH!!! 1-0 Team_1! The Gunners have the breakthrough. Martinelli is the provider as he teases Danilo with neat footwork, before a wonderful turn results in the ball dropping to Nketiah. The forward cuts inside before his drilled shot beats Turner via a slight deflection.
Martinelli teased Danilo before his turn helped the ball into the path of Nketiah, who broke the deadlock.
Aina catches Saka late and receives the first yellow card of the game.
Team_1 have the lead and rightly so after the first half an hour at the Emirates. The Gunners have dominated proceedings and are good value for their advantage.
SAKA!!! 2-0 Team_1! What a goal! Forest appear to have dealt with a corner, but Gibbs-White is robbed of possession. Following a neat subsequent exchange of passes, Saka takes aim and bends a stunning 25-yard effort into the far corner.
Saliba provided the lay-off and Saka did the rest in sublime fashion.
Team_1 have a two-goal lead and it is no more than they deserve. The Gunners are in complete control of this contest.
Today, Forest were hoping to party like it's 1999. Indeed, that was the last time they won a Premier League match in London - beating Wimbledon 3-1 at Selhurst Park. But barring a miraculous turnaround here, they will have to wait at least another year for such celebrations.
Team_1 go in search of more goals as they embark on another venture into the Forest penalty area. Nketiah shoots from a tight angle, but it is never troubling the target.
The half-time whistle cannot come quickly enough for Forest as we enter the last five minutes of the first period. They are certainly regretting that wasted Johnson opportunity earlier on.
You must go back to the 1988-89 season for the last time Forest won away at Team_1, Brian Clough's side prevailing 3-1 at Highbury that day. But as things stand, the wait will almost certainly go on here.
Good effort! On his first Premier League appearance since departing Team_19, Rice tries his luck from distance. But Turner gets down well to hold onto the former Hammers skipper's attempt.
We are into the first of three additional minutes at the end of this first half.
Timber is in need of medical attention after hurting himself during a strong challenge on Johnson.
Timber has his name taken for that challenge on Johnson. The new signing limps towards the touchline and it is unclear whether or not he will be able to continue here.
Timber is back on the field for the final few seconds of the first half.
HALF-TIME: Team_1 2-0 Team_16
Team_1 are well in control as they take a two-goal lead into half-time at the Emirates. Goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka have left Team_16 with a huge mountain to climb in the second half.
Forest have been very much second-best so far, having enjoyed just under 16 per cent of the possession. Although, it could have been a different story had Brennan Johnson converted an earlier opportunity, the Wales forward shooting wide with only Aaron Ramsdale to beat.
We are off and running again at the Emirates with Team_1 kicking things off once more.
Timber goes down again, instantly pulling up as he went to control the ball. It looks like his first Premier League start may end prematurely.
The Emirates applauds Timber, who cannot continue and limps off to be replaced by Tomiyasu.
This marks the 11th time in 12 years that Team_1 are launching their Premier League campaign in London. The only exception was a 1-0 victory over Team_15 at St James' Park on the opening weekend of 2019-20.
As things stand, it looks like it will be more away-day blues for Forest, who lost 13 Premier League games on the road last season. That is something they must address this term in order to stay clear of relegation danger.
The visitors enjoy a rare opportunity to attack and send a long throw into the box. The ball ricochets kindly for Yates, who draws a smart save from Ramsdale, but the flag is subsequently raised for offside.
It remains to be seen whether or not Ramsdale will be Team_1 number one for much longer with the Gunners reportedly keen to sign David Raya from Team_4. The England goalkeeper will be eager to remain first choice under Arteta.
Team_1 still 2-0 to the good as we hit the hour mark at the Emirates. The Gunners remain well in control, but it is important they do not become complacent.
Forest have never in their history lost their opening match in five successive seasons. However, that could happen here unless they turn things around.
The visitors attempt to threaten from a free-kick inside their own half. The delivery is flicked on but, at full stretch, Worrall is unable to keep the ball in play.
Forest could look to introduce Awoniyi in an attempt to potentially salvage something from the game. The striker scored in each of their final four Premier League games last season.
Team_1 look for a third goal that would certainly settle the contest. Odegaard whips the ball into the box, but Forest clear.
Aina's ambitious attempt deflects behind for a corner via Thomas. But Forest are unable to make the most of the opportunity.
Forest make a change with Danilo making way for Awoniyi.
Aina is also given a breather by Cooper with Williams.
Team_1 also make a change with Trossard replacing Nketiah.
OFF THE POST! Rice almost has his first goal for Team_1. The England midfielder goes for placement with a grass-cutting 25-yard attempt, but Turner does brilliantly to get down and tip the ball onto the woodwork.
Forest threaten from a corner at the other end. Boly gets up to meet the delivery, but Rice does just about enough to put him off.
Another Forest change sees Johnson replaced by Elanga, who comes on for his debut.
Mangala drags back Odegaard in an attempt to stop a counter, and goes into the book.
AWONIYI!!! HOPE FOR FOREST! 2-1! The visitors pull a goal back as the two substitutes combine. Elanga races away on the counter before crossing for Awoniyi, who applies a brilliant first-time finish at the near post.
Elanga took full advantage as he galloped into the space down the Team_1 right before crossing for Awoniyi to apply the finishing touch.
Suddenly, Forest have their tails up and go in search of the equaliser. The ball drops for Gibbs-White on the volley, but his 20-yard attempt goes over.
Awoniyi has found the net for a fifth successive game. Stan Collymore is the only Forest player to embark on a longer streak in the Premier League, scoring in six straight matches in 1995.
A tactical change by Team_1 with Gabriel on to replace Martinelli.
The atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense around the Emirates. Team_1 appeared well in control and on course for a comfortable three points. But we are now set for a dramatic finish.
A very attacking change from Forest with Wood on to replace Worrall.
Forest also make a change as Kouyate replaces Mangala.
Team_1 aim to kill the game off with Havertz looking to get in behind. But Aurier makes up vital ground to intercept.
White is the next player into the book for a foul on Williams.
We have just passed the midway point in stoppage time, with seven minutes added by the referee. Forest are still seeking the equaliser, but Team_1 look like they will hold on.
Just 60 seconds of stoppage time remain at the Emirates. Team_1 are nearly there...
Team_1 counter in the dying moments and almost score a third. Saka lays the ball off for Odegaard, who curls a shot narrowly wide of the far post.
FULL-TIME: Team_1 2-1 Team_16
Team_1 make a winning start to the 2023-24 Premier League season, but only just. The Gunners dominated most of the contest and established a well-deserved 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka. But substitute Taiwo Awoniyi struck eight minutes from time to give Team_16 hope and ensure a nervy finish at the Emirates. It was just too late, though, as the hosts held on for maximum points.
Forest, who can draw positives from the way they finished the game, will look to bounce back against Team_17 next Friday. Meanwhile, Team_1 will aim to make it two wins from two against Team_8 three days later.
