93336	Team_13	Team_15	2023-08-19	Etihad Stadium, Manchester	16997.0	Robert Jones	Exciting	"Hello everyone and welcome to live text coverage of the Premier League match between Team_1 and Team_16 at the Emirates Stadium.
The opening weekend of the Premier League continues with reigning champions Team_13 setting the early tempo with a commanding 3-0 win over Team_6 on Friday. Team_1 will aim to follow suit as they look to launch their title challenge against the side that ended their pursuit last season.
Team_1 (4-3-3):Â Aaron Ramsdale; Thomas Partey, Ben White, William Saliba, Jurrien Timber; Martin Odegaard, Declan Rice, Kai Havertz; Bukayo Saka, Eddie Nketiah, Gabriel Martinelli.
SUBS: Karl Hein, Gabriel Magalhaes, Emile Smith Rowe, Jakub Kiwior, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Leandro Trossard, Jorginho, Fabio Vieira, Reiss Nelson.
Team_16 (3-4-3): Matt Turner; Willy Boly, Joe Worrall, Scott McKenna; Serge Aurier, Ryan Yates, Orel Mangala, Ola Aina; Danilo, Brennan Johnson, Morgan Gibbs-White.
SUBS: Ethan Horvath, Neco Williams, Cheikhou Kouyate, Taiwo Awoniyi, Chris Wood, Moussa Niakhite, Anthony Elanga, Remo Freuler, Lewis O'Brien.
Mikel Arteta makes just a single change from last weekend's Community Shield victory - albeit a hugely intriguing one with Nketiah replacing Gabriel, who drops to the bench. In a subsequent tactical reshuffle, White moves across into the heart of defence with Thomas starting at right-back. Havertz moves into an attacking three-man midfield alongside Odegaard and Rice, with Nketiah leading the line.
Meanwhile, Matt Turner starts in goal in the week he joined Forest from Team_1. The former Gunner is one of two new signings named in Steve Cooper's starting line-up along with Aina, who joined on a free transfer. Interestingly, there is no place for Awoniyi, who enjoyed a strong finish to last season - scoring the winner against Team_1 in May.
It is not the first time the two sides are meeting on the opening weekend of a Premier League season. Indeed, they did the same a quarter of a century ago, Marc Overmars scoring the winner as Team_1 prevailed 2-1 at Highbury.
Kick-off has been delayed by 30 minutes due to an issue at the turnstiles. Stay tuned for further updates.
The stadium is gradually filling up with plenty of fans now taking their seats. We should not be too far from starting here.
Later than planned, but the players are finally making their way out onto the field. Kick-off at the Emirates is moments away.
Michael Oliver is today's referee. He blows his whistle and Forest get the match under way.
Both sides will be looking to address their respective form from last season. Team_1 kept just four Premier League clean sheets on home soil, while Forest had the worst away record in the division - winning just one of 19 matches and registered just eight points.
Team_1 quickly settling into their rhythm and Saka earns a corner via Aina's deflection. But Forest deal with two deliveries into their box.
The Gunners are unbeaten in each of their last nine home league meetings with Forest, winning five and drawing four.
Saka cuts inside from the right wing and seeks out Nketiah with a clever reverse pass. However, it is just lacking the required accuracy and Turner comes out to collect.
Today, Forest are aiming to end a run of four successive opening-day defeats. Although, the start to the game suggests they face a tough task in breaking the streak.
CHANCE! Johnson must do better! Against the run of play, Forest are in behind Team_1, who went to sleep at the back. Johnson is all on his own as he latches onto Boly's header and beats Ramsdale, but cannot keep his shot on target.
At the other end, Odegaard threads a neat throughball looking for Nketiah. Turner is quickly out to smother the ball, though the Team_1 forward is subsequently ruled offside.
Forest's lacking of a clinical edge was evident with that Johnson opportunity going begging. They only scored three times during pre-season and failed to find the net in each of their final four warm-up matches.
Team_1 continuing to enjoy most of the possession in their opening match of the season. But the Gunners must look to record more attempts on goal.
We are still goalless inside the opening 20 minutes at the Emirates, where Team_1 have fond memories of their last two meetings with Forest. Indeed, both culminated in commanding 5-0 victories for the Gunners. More of the same today would do very nicely for the hosts.
An anxious moment for Forest as Turner's attempted clearance is charged down by Nketiah. Thankfully for the visitors, the ball ricochets well wide of the target, but their hearts will have momentarily been in their mouths.
Forest are trying to gain a foothold in the contest having enjoyed just over 13 per cent of the possession so far. But they just cannot keep the ball from their opponents for long enough at the moment.
The anticipation rises inside the Emirates as Saka has space in the penalty area. His attempted cross ricochets behind off McKenna. Can the hosts make the most of this opportunity?
NKETIAH!!! 1-0 Team_1! The Gunners have the breakthrough. Martinelli is the provider as he teases Danilo with neat footwork, before a wonderful turn results in the ball dropping to Nketiah. The forward cuts inside before his drilled shot beats Turner via a slight deflection.
Martinelli teased Danilo before his turn helped the ball into the path of Nketiah, who broke the deadlock.
Aina catches Saka late and receives the first yellow card of the game.
Team_1 have the lead and rightly so after the first half an hour at the Emirates. The Gunners have dominated proceedings and are good value for their advantage.
SAKA!!! 2-0 Team_1! What a goal! Forest appear to have dealt with a corner, but Gibbs-White is robbed of possession. Following a neat subsequent exchange of passes, Saka takes aim and bends a stunning 25-yard effort into the far corner.
Saliba provided the lay-off and Saka did the rest in sublime fashion.
Team_1 have a two-goal lead and it is no more than they deserve. The Gunners are in complete control of this contest.
Today, Forest were hoping to party like it's 1999. Indeed, that was the last time they won a Premier League match in London - beating Wimbledon 3-1 at Selhurst Park. But barring a miraculous turnaround here, they will have to wait at least another year for such celebrations.
Team_1 go in search of more goals as they embark on another venture into the Forest penalty area. Nketiah shoots from a tight angle, but it is never troubling the target.
The half-time whistle cannot come quickly enough for Forest as we enter the last five minutes of the first period. They are certainly regretting that wasted Johnson opportunity earlier on.
You must go back to the 1988-89 season for the last time Forest won away at Team_1, Brian Clough's side prevailing 3-1 at Highbury that day. But as things stand, the wait will almost certainly go on here.
Good effort! On his first Premier League appearance since departing Team_19, Rice tries his luck from distance. But Turner gets down well to hold onto the former Hammers skipper's attempt.
We are into the first of three additional minutes at the end of this first half.
Timber is in need of medical attention after hurting himself during a strong challenge on Johnson.
Timber has his name taken for that challenge on Johnson. The new signing limps towards the touchline and it is unclear whether or not he will be able to continue here.
Timber is back on the field for the final few seconds of the first half.
HALF-TIME: Team_1 2-0 Team_16
Team_1 are well in control as they take a two-goal lead into half-time at the Emirates. Goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka have left Team_16 with a huge mountain to climb in the second half.
Forest have been very much second-best so far, having enjoyed just under 16 per cent of the possession. Although, it could have been a different story had Brennan Johnson converted an earlier opportunity, the Wales forward shooting wide with only Aaron Ramsdale to beat.
We are off and running again at the Emirates with Team_1 kicking things off once more.
Timber goes down again, instantly pulling up as he went to control the ball. It looks like his first Premier League start may end prematurely.
The Emirates applauds Timber, who cannot continue and limps off to be replaced by Tomiyasu.
This marks the 11th time in 12 years that Team_1 are launching their Premier League campaign in London. The only exception was a 1-0 victory over Team_15 at St James' Park on the opening weekend of 2019-20.
As things stand, it looks like it will be more away-day blues for Forest, who lost 13 Premier League games on the road last season. That is something they must address this term in order to stay clear of relegation danger.
The visitors enjoy a rare opportunity to attack and send a long throw into the box. The ball ricochets kindly for Yates, who draws a smart save from Ramsdale, but the flag is subsequently raised for offside.
It remains to be seen whether or not Ramsdale will be Team_1 number one for much longer with the Gunners reportedly keen to sign David Raya from Team_4. The England goalkeeper will be eager to remain first choice under Arteta.
Team_1 still 2-0 to the good as we hit the hour mark at the Emirates. The Gunners remain well in control, but it is important they do not become complacent.
Forest have never in their history lost their opening match in five successive seasons. However, that could happen here unless they turn things around.
The visitors attempt to threaten from a free-kick inside their own half. The delivery is flicked on but, at full stretch, Worrall is unable to keep the ball in play.
Forest could look to introduce Awoniyi in an attempt to potentially salvage something from the game. The striker scored in each of their final four Premier League games last season.
Team_1 look for a third goal that would certainly settle the contest. Odegaard whips the ball into the box, but Forest clear.
Aina's ambitious attempt deflects behind for a corner via Thomas. But Forest are unable to make the most of the opportunity.
Forest make a change with Danilo making way for Awoniyi.
Aina is also given a breather by Cooper with Williams.
Team_1 also make a change with Trossard replacing Nketiah.
OFF THE POST! Rice almost has his first goal for Team_1. The England midfielder goes for placement with a grass-cutting 25-yard attempt, but Turner does brilliantly to get down and tip the ball onto the woodwork.
Forest threaten from a corner at the other end. Boly gets up to meet the delivery, but Rice does just about enough to put him off.
Another Forest change sees Johnson replaced by Elanga, who comes on for his debut.
Mangala drags back Odegaard in an attempt to stop a counter, and goes into the book.
AWONIYI!!! HOPE FOR FOREST! 2-1! The visitors pull a goal back as the two substitutes combine.Â Elanga races away on the counter before crossing for Awoniyi, who applies a brilliant first-time finish at the near post.
Elanga took full advantage as he galloped into the space down the Team_1 right before crossing for Awoniyi to apply the finishing touch.
Suddenly, Forest have their tails up and go in search of the equaliser. The ball drops for Gibbs-White on the volley, but his 20-yard attempt goes over.
Awoniyi has found the net for a fifth successive game. Stan Collymore is the only Forest player to embark on a longer streak in the Premier League, scoring in six straight matches in 1995.
A tactical change by Team_1 with Gabriel on to replace Martinelli.
The atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense around the Emirates. Team_1 appeared well in control and on course for a comfortable three points. But we are now set for a dramatic finish.
A very attacking change from Forest with Wood on to replace Worrall.
Forest also make a change as Kouyate replaces Mangala.
Team_1 aim to kill the game off with Havertz looking to get in behind. But Aurier makes up vital ground to intercept.
White is the next player into the book for a foul on Williams.
We have just passed the midway point in stoppage time, with seven minutes added by the referee. Forest are still seeking the equaliser, but Team_1 look like they will hold on.
Just 60 seconds of stoppage time remain at the Emirates. Team_1 are nearly there...
Team_1 counter in the dying moments and almost score a third. Saka lays the ball off for Odegaard, who curls a shot narrowly wide of the far post.
FULL-TIME: Team_1 2-1 Team_16
Team_1 make a winning start to the 2023-24 Premier League season, but only just. The Gunners dominated most of the contest and established a well-deserved 2-0 lead thanks to goals from Eddie Nketiah and Bukayo Saka. But substitute Taiwo Awoniyi struck eight minutes from time to give Team_16 hope and ensure a nervy finish at the Emirates. It was just too late, though, as the hosts held on for maximum points.
Forest, who can draw positives from the way they finished the game, will look to bounce back against Team_17 next Friday. Meanwhile, Team_1 will aim to make it two wins from two against Team_8 three days later.

93432	Team_2	Team_10	2023-11-12	Villa Park, Birmingham	41608.0	Simon Hooper	High Stakes	"Hello, and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League fixture, as Team_4 host Team_19 at the Gtech Community Stadium.
It's a second consecutive London derby in as many weekends for Team_4, whoÂ picked up a smash-and-grab 2-0 victory at Team_7 last time out. They will be hoping to play at their counter-attacking best once more to leapfrog Team_19 in the table, with the visitors sittingÂ just one point and one place above them after 10 games.
Itâs a different story for the Hammers though, who have slipped to ninth following a three-game winless streak. After victories in three of their opening four games, David Moyesâ side have only won once in their six since, losing the last two to Team_2 and Team_9 respectively.
Team_4 (4-3-3): Mark Flekken; Kristoffer Ajer, Nathan Collins, Ethan Pinnock, Vitaly Janelt; Frank Onyeka, Christian Norgaard, Mathias Jensen; Bryan Mbeumo, Neal Maupay, Yoane Wissa.
Team_4 SUBS: Thomas Strakosha, Zanka Jorgensen, Saman Ghoddos, Ben Mee, Mads Roerslev, Yehor Yarmolyuk, Michael Olakigbe, Ethan Brierley, Valintino Adeolokun.
Team_19 (4-2-3-1): Alphonse Areola; Vladimir Coufal, Kontantinos Mavropanos, Nayef Aguerd, Emerson; Tomas Soucek, James Ward-Prowse; Jarrod Bowen, Mohammed Kudus, Said Benrahma; Michail Antonio.
Team_19 SUBS: Lukasz Fabianski, Ben Johnson, Aaron Cresswell, Pablo Fornals, Maxwel Cornet, Danny Ings, Angelo Ogbonna, Thilo Kehrer, Divin Mubama.
Team_4 make two changes following their 2-0 win over Team_7, with Maupay, who played a vital part in Mbeumoâs points-sealing goal, and Onyeka coming into the XI. Aaron Hickey and Roerslev drop out, with Janelt and Ajer pushing out into the full-back positions, whileÂ Maupay spearheadsÂ the Beesâ three-pronged attack alongside Mbeumo and Wissa.
Despite three league games without a victory, Team_19 did come out on top in their midweek Carabao Cup tie with Team_1. Three changes are made from that 3-1 victory, with Ward-Prowse and Antonio in for the suspended Edson Alvarez and Lucas Paqueta, and Fabianski replaced between the sticks by Areola.
The teams are lined up on the pitch ahead of kick-off, and following the playing of the Last Post to mark the remembrance of the lives lost in conflicts across the world, we'll be underway.
KICK-OFF: Maupay gets the game up and running for Team_4, with the first kick of the match in west London!
CHANCE!! Flekken slips as he controls a Pinnock back-pass, almost gifting Antonio a glorious chance to score before he can hack the ball away!
Ward-Prowse's cross-field ball from a free-kick opens up room for Kudus down the right, but his drilled cross into the six-yard box is cleared into touch by Janelt.
Team_4 have won all fourÂ Premier League games they've played against Team_19, scoring twice in each match and keeping three clean sheets.
Norgaard picks out Mbeumo with a lofted ball down the right-hand channel, but the Bees forward is clipped late by Emerson to win a free-kick right on the edge of Team_19 box.
Mbeumo goes for goal from the acute free-kick angle, but Areola sees it all the way and is easily able to make the save for Team_19!
Those four Team_4Â wins over Team_19 are the only previous top-flight meetings between theÂ two sides. In English top division history, only three sides have a better 100 per centÂ win rate against an opponent â Team_13 v Team_3 (12, who also play today), Team_1 v Reading (six) and Team_16 v Portsmouth (six).
Mbeumo darts down the right and takes on Aguerd looking for an opening, but the Team_19 centre-back stands his ground, hardly giving the Cameroon forward an inch and ensuring the ball goes behind for a goal-kick, not a corner.
GOOOOOOAAAALLL!!! Maupay puts Team_4 in front to finish off a crazy passage of play! Deliveries from both Janelt and Mbeumo are nodded away, but the Bees refuse to give up as Janelt dinks the ball back towards the far post. It's headed down and drops for Onyeka, whose half-volley goalwards is glanced into the back of the net by Maupay at close range! They were simply queuing up there, and Maupay is the man to head the ball home for 1-0!
Onyeka's attempted effort on goal had nowhere near enough on it to trouble Areola, but he put the ball in exactly the right place for Maupay to nod home and score his first goal since returning to Team_4!
Onyeka wins a free-kick for Team_4 after Emerson prevents a quick counter-attack from really gathering steam, and the Team_19 left-back is shown the first yellow card of this contest.
Coufal fires a long throw into Team_4 box which Mavropanos gets on the end of, but his header isn't powerful or accurate enough to really trouble Flekken.
Maupay has now scored four goals in six Premier League appearances against Team_19.
WIDE!!! Antonio and Kudus combine for the latter to tee up Bowen in the box, but his left-footed shot from a tight angle flashes across the face and goes wide!
GOOOOOOAAAAAALLL!!!! A quick-fire equaliser in sensational fashion!!! Antonio hangs up a cross from the left byline with Kudus the far-post target. With his back to goal and both feet off the ground, the Ghanaian jumps, twists and smashes an acrobatic bicycle kick into the bottom corner, locking the game up at 1-1! We're barely 20 minutes in and have already seen two goals, with that fantastic volley the pick of the pair so far!
Antonio's cross was accurate but far from the best for Kudus to strike, but boy did the former Ajax winger make the most of it!
Team_19 win a free-kick which Ward-Prowse whips into the box at speed for Mavropanos to attack, but he collides with Flekken in mid-air to leave the Team_4 goalkeeper down on the deck, and concedes a free-kick the other way!
Team_4 are unbeaten in their last 13 Premier League London derby matchesÂ â there have only been four longer such runs in the competitionâs history (threeÂ by Team_1, oneÂ by Team_7). Indeed, only Team_1 (1.83) and Team_7 (1.79) average more points-per-game in these matches than the Bees (1.65).
Collins is dispossessed by Antonio and Benrahma races away with possession, but he's quickly caught up with and fouled by Ajer, who picks up a yellow card for the challenge.
GOOOOOOAAAAALLL!!!! Team_19 have turned the game around here!!! Benrahma cuts inside and fires a cross towards the front post with Kudus arriving. Another volley from the Ghanaian is hit goalwards, but hits the post before Bowen is on hand to tap the rebound into the back of the net! They were 1-0 down after 11 minutes, but just 15 later, Team_19 now lead 2-1!
THE GOAL STANDS!!! There's a VAR check after replays suggest a possible handball from Bowen in controlling that rebounding ball, but the England winger is eventually given the all-clear and Team_19 lead is confirmed!
That's Bowen's seventh goal of the season for Team_19, and the sixth in a row in which he's either scored or assisted (six goals, one assist).
Mavropanos cuts out a throughball from Maupay, but a poor clearance gifts Jensen possession down the left. He races onto it and crosses from the byline, but can only put his attempted cut-back into the side netting!
Mbeumo looks to cut inside off the right and shoot goalwards, but good pressure from Emerson forces him off balance, and Areola can watch the eventual effort sway wide of the mark.
A flick forward from Bowen give Benrahma plenty of open space to run into on the counter, but Onyeka gets across to dispossess the former Team_4 winger and pass the ball back to Flekken.
Team_19 have now scored 10 first-half goals in their 11 games so far, with only Team_15 (12) and Team_11 (11) scoring more often in this season's Premier League.
A Team_4 free-kick towards the far post is headed away unconvincingly by Mavropanos, who gets in the way to make the block as Wissa tries an acrobatic bicycle kick of his own!
WIDE!!! Norgaard arrives at the front post to meet Jensen's delivery from the corner, but he can't turn his glancing header goalwards as the ball flashes wide!
Team_19 pile numbers forward as Benrahma drifts into the middle with the ball at his feet. He spreads play wide to Kudus and Coufal, but the latter's low cross is deflected away to deny the Algerian a shot on goal!
WIDE!!! How have they messed that one up? Aguerd's long pass forward is taken brilliantly on the chest by Kudus, who sets up Bowen to cross into the six-yard box. He rolls the ball right across the face of goal with Benrahma and Antonio arriving at the back post, but the pair get in each other's way to put it wide of the target!! That looked like 3-1 for all money, but Team_4 survive with a massive let-off!
Mbeumo cuts inside off Jensen's pass and looks to cross, but a deflection off Emerson sends the ball looping up and over the top to concede a corner.
Just the SEVEN added first-half minutes to be played at the Gtech Community Stadium, and given what we've seen so far, there could be plenty more set to happen before the teams can head back to the tunnel!
Kudus gets to the byline again and whips a cross towards the front post, but Collins gets across brilliantly to glance the ball away and deny Antonio a sight of goal.
WIDE!!! Mbeumo is fouled by Emerson to win another Team_4 free-kick in a dangerous position, and after playing a one-two with Janelt from the free-kick, the forward fizzes a curling shot towards goal which beats Areola before whistling just inches wide of the far post!
WIDE!!! Onyeka carries the ball forward and finds Mbeumo to his right, who cuts inside to shoot and again sends it just wide of Areola's right-hand upright!
Onyeka and Norgaard combine in the box following a low cross from Mbeumo, but neither can get a shot away as Aguerd puts the ball behind for another Team_4 corner.
WIDE!!! Mbeumo goes the closest yet to a Team_4 equaliser!! Jensen's scooped pass puts Janelt in behind the Team_19 defence, and he cuts the ball back into the middle. Mbeumo's the recipient, but in by far the easiest of his three most recent attempts, the Cameroonian forward can only fire his first-time effort wide of the same post!!! Had both sides been a touch more clinical, this game could well be at least 3-3 so far!
HALF-TIME: Team_4 1-2 Team_19.
A fast-paced, end-to-end first half ends with Team_19 coming back from 1-0 down to lead 2-1 at the break! Early Team_4 pressure told after just 11 minutes, with Maupay on hand to turn home the last of a series of chances for the Bees. Team_19 wouldn't be behind for long though, with Kudus scoring a sensational acrobatic equaliser just eight minutes later! Within another seven, the Hammers had the lead, after another volley from Kudus hit the post and was tapped in by Bowen. The latter almost registered an assist that would've put Team_19 3-1 up, but a mix-up between Benrahma and Antonio saw the ball put wide! With half-time on the horizon, Mbeumo struck three guilt-edge chances wide of the same post, meaning Team_4 come into the break just a goal down despite both sides having copious chances to add to the three we've seen so far!
Bullseye-like Bowen is the first player in Premier League history to score in each of his side's first six away games in a single campaign, while he's also the firstÂ Team_19Â player to score in six in a row on the road overall in the competition. We've seen both sides spurn chances to add to their respectively tally, and if the second half continues in the same manner, who knows how the scoreline will read come full-time!
Flekken's first-half collision with Mavropanos saw the Team_4 goalkeeper come off second best, and he's replaced in net by Strakosha in a precautionary half-time substitution.
KICK-OFF: Bowen kick-started West-Ham's revival with that 19th-minute equaliser, and he kicks off to get the second half underway here!
Team_19 have won three, drawn and lost one each of the five Premier League games they've led at half-time so far this season. Can Team_4 build on their late first-half chances to hit back early in the second?
Mbeumo cuts inside off the right once again and the Team_19 defence knows what's coming. His early shot is blocked by Emerson and falls for Norgaard, but the Bees captain's first-time effort skews up and over the top!
Benrahma and Bowen link up down the left-hand side and the latter crosses low into the six-yard box, but it's far too close to Strakosha and the Team_4 substitute collects with his first touch.
Antonio's deflected cross is brought out of defence by Mbeumo, who comes down the touchline looking to spark a counter-attack. He's clipped late by a rash Soucek challenge though, and Team_19 Czech midfielder picks up the first yellow card of the second half.
In almost the exact same part of the pitch, a foul by Ajer on Benrahma doesn't yield the second yellow card Moyes is looking for. He has a few words for the officials, and is swiftly met by a yellow card of his own!
GOOOAAALLL!!! Team_4 DO get their stroke of luck to net the equaliser!! A Bees corner is played short between Janelt and Mbeumo before the latter fires an in-swinging cross towards the centre, and although Collins attacks it, the final touch is off Mavropanos as the ball beats Areola to fly into the far corner! A touch of fortune for the Bees, but they won't care as they lock the scoreline up at 2-2!
Mbeumo managed three shots and five crosses in the first half alone, and one of his first attempted crosses in the second yields the equaliser Team_4 have been looking for!
A late Jensen challenge on Coufal gives West-Ham a free-kick, but the ball is delivered straight into the gloves of Flekken.
Mbeumo sets Onyeka up to drill a low cross into the six-yard box, but the offside flag is raised to deny Team_4 the chance of putting themselves back in front.
Kudus cuts onto that left foot and tries his luck from 30 yards, but his speculative effort is always rising and sails well over the top.
Maupay is dragged back by Mavropanos as he looks to turn the defender on halfway, and it's a textbook yellow card for the own-goalscorer.
Team_19 make their first changes of the game, with Fornals introduced on the left in place of Benrahma for the Hammers.
Antonio also comes off for Team_19, with Ings entering the fray in place of the Jamaican international to lead the forward line.
Following a Team_19 corner, Team_4 set off on the break as Wissa brings the ball forward. He's got numbers to aim at and looks for Norgaard to his left, but Mavropanos gets a crucial touch to scythe it away for a throw-in!
From the long throw, both Maupay and Janelt see attempted volleys blocked in Team_19 box as Team_4 attempt to really crank up the pressure here!
GOOOOAAAAALLL!!!! Team_4 are back in front with a bullet header from Collins!! The Bees continue to build pressure, and after being denied two corners by last-ditch Hammers defending, Jensen launches a long throw into the box. It's headed away and comes back to the Dane, whose inch-perfect cross to Collins at the far post is sent right into the top corner by the centre-back! A fantastic move from start to finish from the hosts, who have gone ahead, gone behind, and come back again to lead 3-2 here!
Jensen's cross towards Collins was just asking to be met with force by the Irishman, and he did just that to leave Areola rooted to the spot!
Team_19 have lost more Premier League London derby matches than any other side (119),Â with the Hammers losing eight of their last nine such matches away from home.
Wissa and Mbeumo combine in the Team_19 box, but neither can find space to get a shot away and the ball eventually goes behind for a goal-kick!
Team_19 have now conceded six goals in the first 15 minutes of their second halves this season, second only to Team_2 and Team_20 (both seven) in the 2023-24 Premier League.
We're into the last quarter of an hour, and despite Team_4 being 3-2 up, this game is still on an absolute knife-edge. Team_19 already hit back in superb fashion in the first half, and they'll need to do similar in the next few minutes here to salvage at least a point!
A one-two between Fornals and Kudus on the edge of the box allows the latter to clip an aerial ball to the far post, but Bowen can't make anything of the cross and heads behind!
Roerslev will also come on late having played the full 90 last time out, and replaces the booked Ajer in the Bees' right-back position.
A loose touch in his own defensive third from Onyeka allows Ward-Prowse to come away with possession, but his effort from the edge of the box is blocked away by Collins.
Jensen comes off having run the midfield for large passages of this game, and Yarmolyuk, who saw a late chance saved against Team_7, will replace the Team_4 stalwart to see out proceedings here.
WIDE!!! Kudus comes short to receive a Coufal pass and lays the ball off to Fornals, whose first-time effort from the edge of the area rolls just inches to the wrong side of the post!
Forward come the Bees on another counter-attack, with plenty of numbers in support of the carrying Mbeumo. His final ball is a poor one though, and the cut-back is intercepted and cleared by Team_19 who set off on a break of their own!
Mbeumo has been involved in 11 goals in his last nine Premier League London derbies, scoring eight and assisting three. Since the start of last season only Bukayo Saka (13) has had a hand in more such goals than Mbeumo (11).
A long throw from Coufal is launched into the box, but the first touch is Team_4, who subsequently clear. Janelt releases Mbeumo down the left as the Bees counter, but his cross is cut out by Aguerd and Team_19 survive once more!
CHANCE!!! Emerson's threatening cross into the middle almost drops for Kudus at close-range, but Norgaard gets there first to hoof the ball clear!
WIDE!!! The front three combine to go within inches of wrapping up the points! Another counter-attack sees Mbeumo bring the ball forward, before linking up with Wissa. He sets Maupay up in the box to finish, but the Frenchman's first-time shot is drilled just wide of the post!
Wissa comes off late having played a crucial part in almost every Team_4 attack so far, and Ghoddos will see the game out for the Bees in the final third.
Onyeka picks up the ball in space to shoot from 25 yards, but there's not enough on the well-struck low effort to force Areola into a difficult save.
Four added minutes to play at the Gtech Community Stadium, and can Team_4 hang on to the lead they've worked so hard to wrestle back into their favour?
It's batten-down-the-hatches time for the Team_4 defence, which is reinforced further by the introduction of Mee in place of Janelt.
Team_19 win a late corner which is whipped into the area by Ward-Prowse, but after the initial delivery is headed away, Emerson follows up with a half-volley which is sent miles over the bar!
CHANCE!! Maupay and Mbeumo combine in the box to almost open up shooting space from close range, but Aguerd steps in and sends the ball back for Areola to clear!
A long throw into Team_4 box comes to nothing, and Ings' protests for a Team_19 corner earn the striker a late yellow card!
FULL-TIME: Team_4 3-2 Team_19.
A sensational London derby comes to a close, with a second-half turnaround earning Team_4 all three points! Trailing 2-1 at the break following a series of spurned opportunities, the Bees took just 10 minutes to restore parity in the second thanks to an own goal from Team_19 defender Mavropanos. 14 minutes later, they were ahead, as defender Collins rose at the back post to power in an absolute bullet of a header. The final 20 minutes were tetchy to say the least, with Team_19 going close to equalising through Fornals and Kudus. Team_4 had chances to open up a two-goal lead at the other end, but couldn't add to their tally and held out to seal a 3-2 victory! Three hard-earned points for the third game in a row send Team_4 above Team_19 to ninth in the table, with the Hammers dropping to 11th after a third defeat on the spin."	"Aston Villa got back to winning ways and made it 13 straight home Premier League victories with a 3-1 success over Fulham.
Villa were awarded a penalty on eight minutes for a handball by Timothy Castagne, but referee Simon Hooper was sent to the Referee Review Area by the VAR as the ball was seen to hit the Fulham defender's face, and not his arm, with the decision subsequently overturned.
Villa took the lead on 27 minutes, with Youri Tielemans' left-wing cross aimed towards Moussa Diaby inadvertently turned into his own net by Antonee Robinson.
The home side doubled their advantage three minutes before half-time through captain John McGinn, who whipped a superb shot into the bottom-left corner from 20 yards.
Fulham responded in the second half, with Raul Jimenez's low strike tipped on to a post at full-stretch by Emiliano Martinez and Willian dragging a shot narrowly wide.
But it was Villa who struck next on 64 minutes, Ollie Watkins sweeping in from Leon Bailey's cross for his sixth league goal of the season.
The Cottagers did pull a goal back on 70 minutes through Jimenez, who tapped in from Robinson's square pass for his first Fulham goal.
Watkins missed a glorious chance to score his second, heading wide from point-blank range, but it didn't prove costly as Villa made their longest top-flight winning run at Villa Park since October 1983, and made it six victories in a row against London sides for the first time in their league history.
Villa move up to fifth on 25 points, two adrift of leaders Manchester City ahead of their trip to Chelsea.

93323	Team_3	Team_19	2023-08-12	Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth	31508.0	Robert Jones	High Stakes & Exciting	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Premier League clash between Team_6 and Team_13 at Turf Moor.
The Premier League is back for a new season, and it gets underway with an intriguing match-up between a newly promoted side and the reigning champions. Team_6 could have hardly been given a tougher opening fixture, but they should come into it with confidence after cruising to the Championship title last time out in their first season back in the second tier. Led by Vincent Kompany, a Citizens' legend from his playing career, Team_6 reached 101 points and secured promotion with seven games to play, and they will be hoping to get off the mark with a positive result on home soil.
City, meanwhile, claimed a historic treble last term, finally winning their first Champions League title while also taking Premier League and FA Cup glory. It has been a transfer window of change with key players of recent years such as Riyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan leaving the club, but they still come into this campaign expected to be frontrunners and they will be looking to get off to a winning start as they bid for a sixth Premier League crown in seven seasons.
Team_6 (4-4-2): James Trafford; Connor Roberts, Dara O'Shea, Ameen Al Dakhil, Jordan Beyer; Luca Koleosho, Sander Berge, Josh Cullen, Vitinho; Mohamed Zeki Amdouni, Lyle Foster.
SUBS: Josh Brownhill, Jacob Bruun Larsen, Arijanet Muric, Manuel Benson, Anass Zaroury, Jack Cork, Nathan Redmond, Hjalmar Ekdal, Johann Gudmundsson.
Team_13 (4-2-3-1): Ederson; Kyle Walker, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Ake, Rico Lewis; Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri; Bernardo Silva, Julian Alvarez, Phil Foden; Erling Haaland.
SUBS: Aymeric Laporte, Kalvin Phillips, Cole Palmer, James McAtee, Sergio Gomez, Stefan Ortega Moreno, Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol, Jack Grealish.
Kompany includes six new signings as Trafford, signed from City in this window, starts between the sticks while O'Shea comes into the back four alongsideÂ Al Dakhil, who has had his loan move made permanent after impressing last season.Â Berge, Koleosho and Amdouni are the other fresh faces set to play from the off.
In contrast, Pep Guardiola opts to leave his new arrivals on the bench as Gvardiol and Kovacic will be made to wait for their competitive City debuts. Key defenders John Stones and Ruben Dias both miss out through injury while Grealish is on the bench. Lewis starts and so does Alvarez, charged with supporting the prolific Haaland in attack.
The two teams make their way onto the pitch ahead of the opening Premier League game of the season!
Team_6 kick us off, and we are underway in what promises to be another thrilling campaign!
De Bruyne wins an early corner as City look to quiet the lively home crowd with an opening goal.
GOAL!!! HAALAND PUTS CITY AHEAD!!! Having netted 36 Premier League goals last season, it has taken just four minutes for him to open his account for this campaign. It is a typical Haaland goal as he lurks in the box while De Bruyne lofts a deep cross for Rodri. The midfielder nods it back across, and the Norway international is waiting to smash home and put the champions 1-0 up!
Rodri's header was clever to put it on a plate for Haaland, who finished with typical aplomb.
Team_6 fans and players scream for a penalty as Amdouni goes down under the challenge of Akanji, but the referee waves away the protests before a VAR review confirms no spot-kick will be awarded.
It is far from the ideal start for Kompany and the Clarets, who find themselves a goal down against the defending champions. Can they respond?
De Bruyne whips a dangerous ball into the box, and Haaland is there to meet it at the back post. It is at an awkward height, though, and the striker can only volley high over the crossbar.
Haaland â who scored twice in City's opening Premier League game last season â scored a hat-trick in his only previous game against Team_6, a 6-0 win in last season's FA Cup quarter-final. It took him only four minutes to net here in the opening game for the Citizens for a second campaign in a row.
Team_6 work the ball nicely into the visitors' penalty area, and it eventually ends up at the feet of Koleosho. The 18-year-old tries to pick out the far corner, but he gets well underneath his effort and Ederson watches it soar over his crossbar. That was better from Kompany's side, though.
Trafford makes a brilliant stop to deny Rodri's header after Team_6 were caught out at a set-piece situation, though a delayed flag goes up for offside and the goal would not have counted anyway.
Amdouni gives Ederson his first test of the contest, though the City goalkeeper is able to get down and save the low shot with relative ease.
City have had 69.7 per cent of the possession so far, but Team_6 are certainly showing no signs of being overawed and have exhibited some neat attacking play themselves.
Guardiola may be forced into an early change, and it would be an especially damaging one too as De Bruyne clutches at his hamstring.
De Bruyne does indeed limp off, and Kovacic comes on in his place for his City debut.
Haaland has now contributed to at least one goal in his last seven Premier League away games (seven goals, one assist).
Rodri makes a vital interception to nip the ball away from Amdouni after Lewis gave possession away in a dangerous situation. That is a huge let-off for the youngster.
Foster cuts in on his right foot and tries to curl into the far corner, but he cannot get enough bend on his effort and it flies wide of the post. Team_6 are looking lively when they come forward.
Team_6 have won just one of their last 23 league matches against Team_13 (D6 L16) and have lost the last eight in a row by an aggregate score of 26-1. They have responded well to going behind here, though.
City are just enjoying a spell of possession as they try to slow the momentum their hosts had built up in recent minutes.
Some brilliant interplay between Kovacic and Foden takes the latter into a dangerous position in the Team_6 box, but Trafford does brilliantly to race out of his goal and snuff out the chance for a shot.
GOAL!!! HAALAND AGAIN!!! It is a quite brilliant finish to put City 2-0 up, perhaps against the run of play, as he receives the ball in the box from Alvarez. He opts to shoot first-time, and he curls superbly into the top left corner, kissing the crossbar and going in to put his team in control at Turf Moor.
Alvarez's lay-off was perfectly weighted for Haaland to arrow home.
Team_6 will feel hard done by to be two behind, but City have been magnificently ruthless. Two shots on target and two goals for the Citizens, who are surely on their way to three points to kick off the season.
In all competitions, City have won 11 games in a row against Team_6, scoring 40 goals and conceding just one. They beat them 6-0 in the FA Cup last season, inflicting the Clarets' heaviest defeat since losing 6-0 to City themselves in March 1999 in a league game.
Having responded well to City's first goal, the second does seem to have knocked the wind out of Team_6 sails and the home crowd have certainly quietened. It may be a case of getting to the break just the two goals down to regroup and go again in the second 45 minutes.
There will be five minutes of additional time at the end of this first half.
Team_6 have won their opening game in just two of their eight previous Premier League seasons (D1 L5), winning 3-2 at reigning champions Team_7 in 2017-18 and 3-0 at home to Southampton in 2019-20.
HALF-TIME: Team_6 0-2 Team_13
The half-time whistle blows as City take a 2-0 lead into the break after a ruthless display in the opening period. They were ahead after just four minutes, Haaland opening his account for the season by smashing home from Rodri's clever headed assist. Team_6 responded well to going 1-0 down and could have levelled through Koleosho and then Foster, but they would go two goals behind before the breakÂ as Haaland curled home superbly from Alvarez's lay-off to leave the champions very much in the ascendancy at the interval.
Team_6 are in an unfamiliar situation having been so dominant in the Championship last season, but Kompany will remain encouraged by his team's first-half performance despite the scoreline. It would take an almighty effort to recover anything from this game though, facing a side who are unbeaten in their last 44 Premier League games when leading at half-time, failing to win just three of those.
City get us back underway for the second period.
City have won their opening Premier League game in 12 of the last 14 seasons, with both exceptions coming against Team_18 (0-0 in 2010-11, 0-1 in 2021-22). They look on their way to another victory to kick off the season here.
O'Shea makes an important intervention to nip in and take the ball off the toes of Haaland after Silva tried to feed the striker.
Haaland races onto Alvarez's throughball but the pass takes him wide, and O'Shea does well to race back and block the forward's eventual shot behind for a corner.
Rodri lets fly with a fierce effort from 30 yards out, and Trafford is forced to tip it over his crossbar for a corner. The City midfielder then gets his head on the end of the resulting set-piece, but Trafford is again equal to it and gathers down to his right.
The Clarets will have to produce more going forward if they are to make an unlikely comeback, accumulating just 0.23 xG (expected goals) to this point.
A sweeping City move sees them carve Team_6 open again. Haaland lays the ball to his right for Alvarez, but the Argentina international's first touch takes him wide and his drive ends up flying well wide of the right post.
Kompany looks to his bench, first introducing Bruun Larsen for his Team_6 debut in place of Koleosho.
Zaroury also comes on for Amdouni.
What impact will those changes have on the hosts' attacking efforts?
Team_6 last shot came all the way back in the 37th minute. For all of their impressive work, they have just lacked a little in the final third in this game.
Rodri marauds forwards and space looks to have opened up for him to smash towards goal. He just seems hesitant to pull the trigger, though, and by the time he finally does, a Team_6 defender is well-placed to block his drive.
With 20 minutes to play, can City see the remainder of the game out for three points to kick off what they hope will be another successful defence of their Premier League crown?
Foden tries to pick out Haaland in lots of space in the box, but he gets the cross wrong and it flies well out of his striker's reach.
Beyer limps off for Benson.
GOAL!!! RODRI SURELY KILLS IT OFF!!! After City were awarded a free-kick for Al Dakhil bundling over Haaland, Foden's set-piece delivery causes havoc in the Team_6 box as they fail to clear their lines. It sits up nicely for Rodri to hit, and he coolly smashes home to make it 3-0 to the visitors and surely end any hopes of a Clarets comeback.
With the result surely beyond doubt, it appears Guardiola will look to shake it up by making substitutes.
Guardiola does indeed make changes, first bringing on Gvardiol for his City debut as Lewis makes way.
Ake is replaced by Laporte.
Haaland will not get a hat-trick to start the season as his outing is over. Palmer is on in his place.
Team_6 lost just one home league game in 2022-23 (W16 D6), going down 2-1 against QPR in April. However, as a Premier League side they have lost five of their last eight at Turf Moor, and they look on course for another defeat here.
Alvarez stings the palms of Trafford with a fierce drive, though the goalkeeper deals with it well.
Rodri's strike has capped an excellent performance, pulling the strings for the Citizens with an assist and a goal while leading his team in final third entries (14) and touches (88).
The fourth official puts up his board and indicates there will be six minutes of additional time at the end of this game.
Berge makes way for Brownhill.
Redmond enters the fray for Foster.
Zaroury brings down Walker with a sliding challenge, receiving the first yellow of the contest. However, VAR is checking for a potential red card, and Zaroury may be in further trouble...
ZAROURY IS SENT OFF!!! The replays show the substitute's right foot catches Walker high on his left leg, and a VAR review rules the tackle is worthy of a red card. Team_6 are down to 10 men!
Walker, just involved in the incident that saw Zaroury given his marching orders, makes way for McAtee.
FULL-TIME: Team_6 0-3 Team_13
City's Premier League title defence is off to a winning start as they claim a comfortable 3-0 triumph over newly promoted Team_6 at Turf Moor. They were set on their way to victory just four minutes in, Haaland thumping home Rodri's neat assist before the prolific striker made it 2-0 before the break with a sublime curling finish. It was a long way back for the Clarets, and any hopes of an unlikely turnaround were ended 15 minutes from time whenÂ Rodri smashed into the back of the net after a free-kick caused havoc in the Team_6 penalty area. Things got even worse for the hosts in the dying seconds as Zaroury initially received a yellow card for a foul on Walker, only for a VAR review to adjudge the tackle to be worthy of a sending-off as City run out easy victors.
The first Premier League game of the season goes the way of the champions, moving them top of the league ahead of the rest of the opening round of fixtures this weekend. That is a position they will attempt not to relinquish in their bid for a sixth league title in seven seasons. For Kompany and Team_6, they will be encouraged by a decent performance, if not the result, in a fixture that will be one of the hardest they play all season.

93347	Team_9	Team_20	2023-08-26	Goodison Park, Liverpool	38851.0	Craig Pawson	Normal	"Hello and welcome to live coverage of this Premier League fixture as Team_9 get their 2023-24 campaign under way against Team_10 at Goodison Park!
Team_9 were perilously close to the drop last term, and if not for Abdoulaye Doucoure scoring the only goal of the game against Team_3 on this ground in May, they would have suffered their first relegation from the top flight since 1951. With Sean Dyche having a full pre-season to work with his squad, the Toffees will be hoping for a more solid showing in his first full campaign in charge.
Team_10 have endured a challenging pre-season with boss Marco Silva and star players Aleksandar Mitrovic, Willian and Joao Palhinha linked with exits. While the future of talismanic striker Mitrovic remains unclear, all four are still at the club for the start of this campaign, and a repeat of 2022-23's top-half finish would be seen as an outstanding achievement for the Cottagers.
Team_9 (4-5-1): Jordan Pickford; Nathan Patterson, James Tarkowski, Michael Keane, Ashley Young; James Garner, Abdoulaye Doucoure, Idrissa Gueye, Amadou Onana, Alex Iwobi; Neal Maupay.
Team_9 SUBS: Joao Virginia, Arnaut Danjuma, Vitalii Mykolenko, Andre Gomes, Ben Godfrey, Jarrad Branthwaite, Thomas Cannon, Lewis Dobbin, Tyler Onyango.
Team_10 (4-2-3-1): Bernd Leno; Kenny Tete, Issa Diop, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson; Harrison Reed, Sasa Lukic; Harry Wilson, Tom Cairney, Willian; Raul Jimenez.
Team_10 SUBS: Marek Rodak, Calvin Bassey, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Bobby Decordova-Reid, Andreas Pereira, Kevin Mbabu, Carlos Vinicius, Matthew Dibley-Dias, Jay Stansfield.
Striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin is the big-name absentee for Team_9, having failed to recover from a hamstring injury in time to make the Toffees' season opener. Maupay deputises for him up front, while Young, ironically, becomes the oldest outfielder to debut for a Premier League side since Kevin Phillips (40 years, 24 days) at Team_8 in August 2013, at the age of 38 years and 34 days.
Team_10 hand a competitive debut to former Team_20 striker Jimenez, with Mitrovic starting the season on the bench after publicly flirting with a move to Al-Hilal. Fellow new signing Bassey starts on the bench with Ream keeping his place in defence, while midfielder Palhinha is out with a shoulder issue.
Team_10 have faced Team_9 in their opening game of a top-flight season twice previously and lost both games, losing 3-0 in 1963-64 and 1-0 in 1966-67. Will the Cottagers fare better this time around? The teams are out at Goodison Park, and kick-off is imminent!
We're under way at Goodison Park as Team_9 and Team_10 get their 2023-24 seasons up and running!
It will be intriguing to see how both teams handle big-name absentees here. While Team_9 always miss Calvert-Lewin when he's out, they are also without the injured Dwight McNeil. Meanwhile, Palhinha was outstanding after joining Team_10 from Sporting CP last term and represents a big miss, while both Pereira and Mitrovic are only among the substitutes.
Iwobi looks for Maupay with a long ball in behind, but Leno is on hand to sweep it up. Team_10 then break through Robinson, but his cross is just cut out in front of Wilson at the back post.
HUGE CHANCE! Doucoure somehow finds himself one-on-one with Leno after breaking between Ream and Diop, but the Team_9 midfielder's finish is too close to the Team_10 goalkeeper, who diverts it wide with his right foot. That's a huge opportunity for the hosts.
Team_9 resulting corner comes to nothing, and Team_10 can enjoy a spell of possession inside their own half. Itâs been a competitive start here on Merseyside.
Team_9 have only lost their opening Premier League game in one of the last 11 seasons (W4 D6), though that defeat did come at home to Team_7 last term. The Toffees have drawn their opening Premier League match more often than any other side in the competition, with 12 of their 31 such games ending level (W9 L10).
Jimenez is flagged offside as he looks to break down the left channel. The Â£5.5million signing failed to find the net in the Premier League for Team_20 last term â Team_10 will be hoping he can rediscover his old form after his move.
Lukic keeps Willian's mishit cross alive at the back post, but some strong pressing from Team_9 forces Team_10 all the way back to Leno. The Goodison Park crowd liked that.
Team_9 are sitting in a 4-5-1 shape without the ball, with Doucoure looking to support Maupay when they do turn it over. Reed misplaces a pass in midfield, but Patterson quickly does likewise. Its been a scrappy start.
Team_10 boss Silva is, of course, no stranger to these surroundings, having led Team_9 between 2018 and 2019. He'd surely love to get one over on his former employers here.
Good stuff from Team_9. Maupay and Iwobi press Diop high and the Team_10 defender cedes possession, with Doucoure then winning a corner off Lukic.
Team_9 load the box from the corner, but Leno gets a strong punch to the ball. Team_10 then break, but a mix-up between Willian and Jimenez allows the hosts to recover.
Iwobi breaks into the box and looks for the bottom-right corner, only to see his effort deflect wide off Diop. It's another Team_9 corner â the Toffees are trying to up the tempo here.
The corner drops for Gueye, who sees his shot charged down. Team_9 are quickly back on the ball, but Maupay is flagged offside.
WIDE! Iwobi threatens again, darting inside from the left before looking to cut his shot into the bottom-left corner. It drops narrowly wide of Leno's right-hand post. Unlucky!
Team_10 are struggling to build much momentum, with Palhinha and Pereira clearly missed in midfield. Jimenez is dropping deep in a bid to link the play, with Wilson and Willian playing high and wide.
Wilson bends a pass out towards Willian on the left flank, but it bounces harmlessly over the Brazilian's head and out. That rather sums up the Cottagers' attacking efforts early on.
Willian looks to beat Patterson on the outside and hit the byline, but the former Team_1 and Team_7 man overruns it, and Team_9 get a goal-kick.
Team_10 have won three of their last five Premier League games against Team_9 (D1 L1), as many as they had in their previous 18 against them (D2 L13). They're looking to win consecutive league meetings with the Toffees for the first time since August 2005, having triumphed 3-1 on this ground in April.
Team_10 have had 78 per cent of the possession thus far but have done precious little with it. Team_9 high press has made things awkward for the visitors.
Willian jumps into a rather reckless challenge on Garner, and gets the first yellow card of the game. Team_9 will look to hit the box from this free-kick.
Onana's delivery reaches Tarkowski at the far postâ¦ but the angle is against the defender, and he can only hook the ball into Leno's gloves.
We're past the half-hour mark at Goodison and we've seen little by way of goalmouth action. Doucoure forced a save from Leno five minutes in, and that remains the only shot on target at either end.
Team_10 look menacing as Wilson strides inside from the right, but a terrible pass gives Cairney no chance. Team_9 then break through Iwobi, but Ream cuts out his pass towards Maupay. Both teams need more composure in the final third.
WHAT A CHANCE! Iwobi's teasing cross is headed down by Doucoure, and it reaches Maupay six yards out. He looks destined to open the scoring, but Leno smothers his shot and it bounces wide. That's a huge let-off for Team_10!
CONTROVERSY! Leno goes up to claim a hanging cross and collides with Tarkowski as he lands, dropping the ball. The Team_9 man turns it into an empty net, but referee Stuart Attwell quickly blows for a foul. The home fans are not happy, they feel there was no contact on Leno!
Team_10 need to rediscover their composure after a couple of nervy moments. It's been a game low on quality overall, but Team_9 have certainly looked the more likely scorers.
Tarkowski is forward for another deep free-kick and attempts to keep a mishit cross in play at the far post, but Robinson does well to steal possession inside his own area.
Another promising Team_9 break sees Iwobi switch the play to Onana, who hammers a volley at goal from the corner of the box. He makes a clean connection, but it's straight at Leno.
LENO AGAIN! The Team_10 goalkeeper has kept his team level here. Maupay darts in behind to reach Onana's throughball and prods the ball goalwards, only for Leno to smother it. Iwobi loses his footing on the follow-up, and another chance goes begging for the hosts.
Team_10 are being torn apart inÂ transition here. Gueye drives through midfield to find Patterson, but he lifts his shot well over the crossbar.
Maupay shoots on the turn just inside the area, but it's straight at Leno. Team_9 continue to pen Team_10 back.
For all the talk about extended periods of stoppage time, there will only be one additional minute before the break. This game has flowed quite nicely.
HALF-TIME: Team_9 0-0 Team_10.
Attwell blows the half-time whistle, and somehow, it's still goalless at Goodison Park. While Team_10 have enjoyed plenty of the ball, they have created next to nothing in attack and have relied heavily on Leno at the other end. Doucoure and Maupay have been denied by excellent reflex saves from the former Team_1 shot-stopper â will the Toffees rue those missed chances?
Team_10 have managed one shot, none on target, and registered just four touches inside Team_9 area. That's despite the Cottagers having almost 70 per cent of the possession. Silva can't be happy with his team's display, and it wouldn't be a surprise to see Mitrovic and Pereira come on soon.
It always seemed likely that Silva would turn to his bench at the break, and he's done exactly that. Decordova-Reid replaces Willian.
Team_9 get the second half under way. Can they build on a positive first 45 minutes to start their season with a win?
Team_10 created 0.04 xG to Team_9 2.22 in the first half. They needed to change something in attack, but it's perhaps surprising to see Willian make way, rather than Cairney or Wilson.
Diop slices a clearance out of play before Patterson also concedes a cheap throw-in. It's been a scrappy, competitive start to the second period.
Excellent work from Keane and Garner, who both track Cairney all the way to the sideline before winning a throw off the Team_10 captain. The visitors are still struggling to find a way through Team_9 press.
Decordova-Reid has taken up Willian's position on the left in a straight swap. He's involved for the first time as Team_10 break, but he runs into Gueye as he cuts inside, and Team_9 can clear.
Team_10 are gifted a corner as Patterson completely misjudges a header back to Pickford, sending it well wide of his own goal.
Team_10 work the ball short to Reed, whose cross is headed up in the air. Young eventually puts it behind for another corner on the opposite side.
The corner is half cleared and the ball drops to Lukic on the edge of the D, but he hooks an awkward volley comfortably wide. Pickford never looked worried.
At the age of 38 years and 34 days, Team_9 new signingÂ Young has become the third oldest outfield player to appear for the club in the Premier League, after Richard Gough (39y 23d) and Dave Watson (38y 56d).
Jimenez holds the ball up well to feed Tete on the right, and the full-back is tripped by Tarkowski. Team_10 have a chance to whip theÂ free-kick into the area, but they opt to go short instead.
OFF THE POST! Jimenez goes agonisingly close to a first Team_10 goal! Wilson hits the byline and lifts a cross into the area, where Jimenez is waiting to volley towards goal. His strike clips the inside of Pickford's right-hand post and bounces out, before Decordova-Reid shoots over on the rebound.
That will be Jimenez's last involvement on his first competitive outing for Team_10. Mitrovic is on, to a great reception from the visiting fans.
Pereira is also on, taking Cairney's place just behind the striker.
Team_10 missed the ability to go direct without Mitrovic in the first half.Â They will hope his introduction gives them a different edge in attack â they've improved since the restart.
Young lifts a teasing cross into the six-yard box, but Maupay and Garner are both unable to reach it. This match has an end-to-end feel about it now.
Garner's deep cross deflects wide for a corner, and the Goodison Park crowd find their voiceÂ once more.
Gueye keeps the overhit kick alive at the far post before crossing against the nearest white shirt and behind for another set-piece.
The latest corner is delivered with pace into the six-yard box, but Diop rises to glance it clear for a throw-in. Mitrovic stays down in the box and is receiving treatment on the pitch, much to the annoyance of the home fans.
Team_10 have Vinicius stripped and ready to replace Mitrovic, but the Serbia striker seems to want to play on. Losing him to injury would be a huge blow.
Mitrovic is back on, for the time being at least, with Vinicius sitting back on the bench. We'll have to wait and see how this one plays out.
CROSSBAR! HOW HAVE Team_9 NOT SCORED? Iwobi cuts inside and draws a diving save from Leno with a right-footed effort from the edge of the area. The goal is gaping as Patterson follows it up, but he crashes his shot against the crossbar and away! That's the biggest let-off let for Team_10!
Wilson goes for goal from range following a strong solo run through the heart of midfield,Â but it's always rising and flies clear of Pickford's crossbar.
Team_10 goal has lived a charmed life at times in this game. Patterson will be desperate for Team_9 to go on and get the winner now, having squandered the clearest chance yet. The goal was absolutely gaping as he side-footed against the woodwork!
Team_9 will give a debut to loanee Danjuma here. He's replacing Maupay in attack, sevenÂ months after he rejected the Toffees to join Team_18.
GOAAAAAAL! DECORDOVA-REID PUTS Team_10 1-0 UP! Team_9 have missed chance after chance, and now, they're behind! Substitutes Mitrovic and Pereira combine, with the latter beating Tarkowski for pace and crossing low for Decordova-Reid, who couldn't miss from inside the six-yard box!
Team_9 will be cursing their luck, having gone behind after clearly enjoying the better of this game. They have around 15 minutes â plus potentially a long period of stoppage time â to salvage something.
All six of Team_9 home wins in the Premier League last season were to nil, with five of those being by a 1-0 scoreline. The Toffees haven't won any of their last 12 home league games when conceding at least once (D2 L10) since beating Team_8 3-2 in May 2022. They need to produce something special to start the season with three points now.
GREAT CHANCE FOR 2-0! Decordova-Reid escapes Patterson's attentions at the back post to reach Wilson's tempting delivery, but he sends his volley over! Team_10 could have killed the contest there.
Although Team_9 have edged long periods of this game, this is a new challenge for the Toffees. Team_10 are sitting back and they need to find a way of breaking them down.
Robinson hares forward on the break and attempts to find Wilson with a cross, which is sliced behind by an Team_9 defender. Pereira's corner is delivered with pace, but it fails to beat the first man.
Team_9 have struggled since falling behind. Garner looks to deliver from the right, but it's easy for the Team_10 defence to mop up. The hosts have fewer than 10 minutes plus stoppage time to find a response.
Team_9 introduce 20-year-old forward Dobbin, with Garner withdrawn.
LENO SAVES Team_10 AGAIN! Young's in-swinging cross is missed by Danjuma, but Iwobi is there to attack it at the far post. He prods an effort goalwards, but Leno gets down to tip it wide. If Team_10 see this out, their goalkeeper deserves plenty of credit.
Team_9 resulting corner is nodded goalwards by Keane, but it's comfortable for Leno.
Tete is booked for timewasting over a free-kick inside Team_9 half. Officials have been told to come down harshly on those offences this season.
Unlucky! Mitrovic takes a cross down and shoots on the turn from a tight angle, but Pickford gets his body behind the ball. The Team_10 striker has led the line well after shaking off that earlier injury scare.
Mitrovic appeals for handball after seeing a shot blocked at close range inside the area. A few Team_10 players make their cases to the referee, but he's not interested! Team_9 go up the other end and win a cornerâ¦
Leno punches the corner out to Gueye, who sees a shot deflect wide for another set-piece.
CLOSE! The initial delivery is cleared, but the second cross finds Tarkowski at the far post. He looks for the bottom-right corner with a diving header, but it rolls agonisingly wide. We will have SIX minutes of stoppage time, with Team_9 still pushing!
Silva and another member of Team_10 coaching staff are shown yellow cards by the referee. That delay will only add to the time we still have to play at Goodison.
CHANCE! But the flag is up! Danjuma breaks in behind and is one-on-one with Leno, but he rushes his shot and bends it wide. The flag then goes up to spare the loanee's blushes!
Team_9 are struggling to get the ball where they want it now, with Team_10 looking composed as they keep possession high up the pitch. There will likely be another minute or so to add to the two remaining.
Pickford thumps a free-kick downfield as Team_9 flood the Team_10 box. Doucoure heads it towards goal, but there's nobody attacking the second ball and Leno claims it. The visitors are almost there!
Another chance! Keane is found in space by a high ball into the area, but his header is straight at Leno. The offside flag might've gone up anyway. Surely Team_10 have done enough?
FULL-TIME: Team_9 0-1 Team_10.
The whistle blows for full-time, and Team_10 start their season with a smash-and-grab victory over Team_9! Decordova-Reid was the difference after coming on at half-time, tapping in the only goal of the game following fine work from fellow substitute Pereira. Team_10 real hero, however, was Leno. The goalkeeper denied Maupay and Doucoure with outstanding saves, while Patterson hit the crossbar with the goal gaping. Team_9 created chance after chance, but they couldn't take them!
Despite managing 19 shots to Team_10 nine, and nine on target to the visitors' two, Team_9 start the season with a loss. They will have to pick themselves up ahead of a difficult trip to Team_2 next week, while Team_10 face west London rivals Team_4 next time out.
